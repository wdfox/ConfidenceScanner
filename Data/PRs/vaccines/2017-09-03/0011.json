{"title": "Enhanced immune response to influenza", "text": "Researchers report an immunization approach for influenza that combines existing influenza vaccines and a broadly protective antibody that engages CD23, an antibody receptor implicated in the immune response, to elicit an enhanced antibody response; among mice exposed to the H5N1 virus, the approach resulted in increased protection in mice that received the enhanced immunization, compared with control mice, findings with potential implications for the development of a universal influenza vaccine, according to the authors.
