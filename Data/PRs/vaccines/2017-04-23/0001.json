{"title": "Researchers find key mechanism to control antibody production", "text": "A research team from iMM Lisboa led by Lu\u00eds Gra\u00e7a has found a cellular mechanism that underlies the development of autoimmune diseases.The immune system is responsible for our body's defence against infections. However, an inefficient and uncontrolled defence can lead to certain lesions and result in autoimmunity. The study, published in Nature Communications, builds on previous observations from the same team who found that a specific type of cells regulate antibody production. They hypothesized there was probably a marked division of tasks between different cells of the immune system: those that help the production of antibodies (T follicular helper) and those that stop the production of antibodies against our own tissues (T follicular regulatory).\r\nThe team developed experimental methodologies which allowed them to identify the molecular targets that lead to the formation of antibodies in both helper and regulatory cells.The development of autoantibodies is one of the key factors for the development of several autoimmune diseases, such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis.", "article_link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms15067", "url": "http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-04/idmm-rfk042717.php", "region": "europe", "source_link": "http://imm.medicina.ulisboa.pt/index.php/?cID=2338", "funder": "", "meeting": "", "institution": "Instituto de Medicina Molecular", "keywords": ["Cell Biology", " Genetics", " Molecular Biology", " Medicine/Health", " Immunology/Allergies/Asthma", " Vaccines", " Transplantation"], "journal": "Nature Communications", "description": "The study may hold implications in future clinical applications concerning more efficient vaccine development or treatment of autoimmune diseases.", "date": "Thu, 27 Apr 2017 04:00:00 GMT"}
