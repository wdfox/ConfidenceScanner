{"title": "Experts seek to jump-start vaccine development", "text": "Although many infectious diseases lack vaccines, current vaccine research is limited, primarily due to an understandable but unfortunate lack of commercial interest. A new article identifies and discusses the gaps in human capital necessary for robust vaccine development.The authors recommend the formation of an institute that will focus on the development of vaccines that are of obvious public health importance but not necessarily of commercial interest. An advisory committee of key stakeholders from, industry, government, academia, and private foundations should agree to the goals, structure, and governance for this institute; identify the ideal training program for future vaccine researchers; and agree on the degree of contributions available from each stakeholder.\"We look forward to advancing approaches to increase trained and experienced human capital that promote robust beginning-to-end vaccine development,\" said Dr. William Gruber, senior author of the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences article.\r\n", "article_link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nyas.13316", "url": "http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-02/w-est022117.php", "region": "namerica", "source_link": null, "funder": "", "meeting": "", "institution": "Wiley", "keywords": ["Medicine/Health", " Vaccines", " Public Health"], "journal": "Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences", "description": "Although many infectious diseases lack vaccines, current vaccine research is limited, primarily due to an understandable but unfortunate lack of commercial interest.", "date": "Thu, 23 Feb 2017 05:00:00 GMT"}
