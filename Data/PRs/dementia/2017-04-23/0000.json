AAAS Annual Meeting\nFebruary 15 - 19, 2018Austin, TXA new study published in Diabetologia (the journal of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [EASD]) reveals that overweight and obese individuals with early stage type 2 diabetes (T2D) had more severe and progressive abnormalities in brain structure and cognition compared to normal-weight study participants.The research conducted by Dr Sunjung Yoon and Dr In Kyoon Lyoo (Ewha Brain Institute, Ewha Womens University, Seoul, South Korea), Hanbyul Cho (The Brain Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA), and colleagues

range of health problems in multiple organs throughout the body.", "Complications in the brain caused by the disease may accelerate cognitive dysfunction, and even increase the risk of dementia.",

independently associated with brain alterations, as well as carrying a risk of further exacerbating metabolic abnormalities arising from T2D.", "Little is known, however, about the effect on the brain of excess weight or obesity in the presence of T2D.A group of 150 Koreans between the ages of 30 and 60 were recruited for the study, comprising 50 overweight/obese individuals with T2D, 50 normal-weight individuals with T2D, and 50 normal-weight control individuals without diabetes.", "Participants were matched for age and sex across the three groups, and diabetic individuals were also matched for disease duration.", "Individuals with chronic diabetic complications or major medical, neurological, or psychiatric disorders were excluded from the study, and all those with diabetes had been diagnosed within the previous 5 years and had not received stable insulin therapy.Data about the structure of participants' brains were acquired using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which allowed the mean thickness of the cerebral cortex to be measured across its entirety.", "Participants also underwent cognitive assessments consisting of tests of memory, psychomotor speed, and executive function, as these are known to be affected in people with T2D.The study found that grey matter was significantly thinner in clusters in the temporal, prefrontoparietal, motor and occipital cortices of the brains of diabetic study participants when compared to the non-diabetic control group.", "Further thinning of the temporal and motor cortices was also observed in the overweight/obese diabetic group, compared to normal-weight diabetics.", "The team also discovered region-specific changes which suggested that the temporal lobe has a particular vulnerability to the combined effects

the temporal lobe has also been identified as one of the earliest observable changes in the large-scale structure of the brain in patients with Alzheimer's disease.", "The alterations to that region of the brain which were observed in this study may be an indication of how being overweight/obese, having T2D, and the risk of developing dementia are linked.While the study notes that current WHO guidelines that use Body Mass Index (BMI) to classify individuals as overweight or obese do not differ according to ethnic origin, people of Asian ethnicity tend to be more vulnerable to slight
