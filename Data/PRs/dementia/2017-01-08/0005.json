The Tsimane experience high parasite loads, making them a suitable population for study for the role of the E4 allele in this circumstance. The researchers undertook a genetic analysis, measured immune markers of parasitic infection, and conducted cognitive tests on 372 Tsimane men and women aged 6 to 88 years. They found that for the Tsimane who did not carry the E4 allele, a larger parasite burden resulted in poorer cognitive performance. Those who carried the E4 allele, however, maintained cognitive performance even with very high parasite burdens.  \"This is a wonderful, unanticipated case of a balanced polymorphism affecting a trait, dementia, with predictably major selection consequences\" said Thoru Pederson, Ph.D., Editor-in-Chief of The FASEB Journal. \"Evolution may not work in quite so mysterious ways as delightfully entertaining ways.\""}
