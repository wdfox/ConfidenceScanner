Unfortunately we know from our own prior work, and that of others, that weight loss is difficult to achieve and maintain over the long term.

Approximately 2,800 individuals with an average age of 74 years participated in the study. Three-quarters were women; three-quarters were white and one-quarter were African-American.  While BMI status influenced the benefits accrued from memory training, the researchers found no difference in the benefits to older adults provided by training in reasoning or in speed of processing regardless of BMI.Memory training focused on improving verbal episodic memory through instruction and practice in strategy use. Reasoning training focused on improving the ability to solve problems that contained a serial pattern. Speed training focused on visual search and the ability to process increasingly more information presented in successively shorter inspection times.The data for the study was obtained from cognitively normal older adults who participated in the multi-center Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly (ACTIVE) randomized controlled study, the largest trial of cognitive training ever conducted."}
