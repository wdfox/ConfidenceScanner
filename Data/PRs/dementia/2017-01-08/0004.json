This activation also linked the intensity of learning to enhanced memory strength.\r\nAlthough memory decline is part of the normal aging process, it manifests more severely in those with neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's. This, in part, is due to a breakdown of the brain's communication networks that are critical for cognitive function.\r\nThe Rutgers study is important to the research being done into age-related memory loss and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's because no consistent biological deficits have been identified as a target for the treatment. Scientists like Shumyatsky believe that understanding the molecular pathways in the brain will help find better treatments for humans.\r\n \"The memory process is very much the same in both human and mouse brains,\" said Shumyatsky \"Our group has been unraveling molecular mechanisms that maintain and improve memory, and what our research tells us is that there are different answers to controlling and improving memory.\"\r\n"}
