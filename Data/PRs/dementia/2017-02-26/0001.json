The more we know about this disease, the more likely we'll be able to figure out how to treat it and perhaps eventually prevent it.\"To date, brain autopsies of cases where individuals reported suffering multiple concussions have yielded a wide range of results, including: no neuropathological changes in the brain, presence of CTE alone, presence of CTE and another neurodegenerative disease, or a non-CTE neurodegenerative disease only.The majority of brains studied by the CCC and other centres have come from donations made as a result of concern over symptoms -- usually of unexplained cognitive impairment -- displayed while the individual was alive, though not all of these cases resulted in findings of the CTE tauopathy in the brain.  However, the referral of brains of symptomatic individuals who have a history of concussions increases the chances that some form of brain degeneration -- whether CTE or other -- would be present, which has potential to create a sample that isn't representative of the overall population. \"Obviously brain trauma and repetitive brain trauma can result in cognitive impairment and possibly contribute to a neurodegenerative disease,\" says Dr. Hazrati. \"But since we've seen cases of brains that experienced multiple concussions but don't have CTE, and now a brain with CTE but absence of any head trauma, there is indication that we should be cautious about labelling trauma as the only possible cause of CTE because it looks to be more complicated than that.\"", "article_link": null, "institution": "University Health Network", "journal": "International Journal of Pathology and Research", "keywords": ["Medicine/Health", " Neurobiology"], "date": "Thu, 02 Mar 2017 05:00:00 GMT", "source_link": null}
