gene variant linked to Alzheimer's, were diagnosed with the disease 50 percent more often than men with the same genetic profile.The findings presented in the USC-led study expand the number of participant data by ninefold and indicate the critical decade falls between 65 and 75, more than 10 years after the start of menopause.", "Previous studies in animals and humans have reported a
