Currently, challenges in making an early and definitive diagnosis of AD limit opportunities to intervene with disease-modifying therapies before substantial neurodegeneration occurs. Neurodegeneration in AD has been attributed to the accumulation of amyloid-\u03b2 proteins (A\u03b2) in the central nervous system, and A\u03b2 may be present up to 20 years prior to the onset of cognitive symptoms. Recently, noninvasive imaging techniques have been developed that can accurately detect and monitor A\u03b2 deposition in the retinas of rodent AD models. The use of similar techniques to assess A\u03b2 accumulation in human retinas may enable significant advances in early detection and treatment of AD.In this issue of JCI Insight, a study led by Maya Koronyo-Hamaoui at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center adapted a noninvasive retinal imaging approach to characterize A\u03b2 deposition, the pathological hallmark of AD, in the retinas of AD patients and healthy controls. This live retinal imaging enabled the detection and quantification of A\u03b2 plaques and revealed increased deposits in AD patients compared to controls. These positive results demonstrate the feasibility of this approach as a tool for screening those at risk of AD. "}
