Glenn Cohen\r\n\tScientists are in the early stages of developing the technology to sustain previable fetuses in artificial wombs. While this research brings us closer to providing excellent care for premature newborns, it raises major legal and ethical questions, especially for abortion rights in America. This article explores some potential consequences for abortion rights if artificial womb technology were implemented.
