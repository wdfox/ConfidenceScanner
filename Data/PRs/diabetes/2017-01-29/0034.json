It appears in the early stages of mild cognitive impairment -- before symptoms of memory problems begin to surface. Whether it's a cause or consequence of neurological dysfunction has been unclear, but research at Temple University's Lewis Katz School of Medicine shows unequivocally that glucose deprivation in the brain triggers the onset of cognitive decline, memory impairment in particular.", "date": "Tue, 31 Jan 2017 05:00:00 GMT"}
