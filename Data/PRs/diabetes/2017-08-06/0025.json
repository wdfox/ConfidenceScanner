Intensive research in the past decade has yielded many exciting new mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of heart failure, but progress toward successful therapies to prevent, halt and reverse heart failure has been painfully slow. The overall goal of this Keystone Symposia conference is to focus on heart failure and highlight the scientific advances in basic discovery and early-phase therapeutic development in this fast-moving field. The symposium will provide the field with an opportunity for robust discussion about the major issues crossing the translational divide from basic discovery to therapies.", "date": "Tue, 08 Aug 2017 04:00:00 GMT"}
