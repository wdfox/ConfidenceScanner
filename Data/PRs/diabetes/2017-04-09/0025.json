{"title": "Avocados may help combat the metabolic syndrome", "text": "A new review investigates the effects of avocados on different components of  metabolic syndrome, which is a clustering of risk factors including high blood sugar, cholesterol, blood pressure, and body mass index. These risk factors lead to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.According to studies reported in the literature, avocados have the most beneficial effects on lipid profiles, with changes to LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and phospholipids. The peel, seed, flesh, and leaves of avocados have differing effects on components of  metabolic syndrome. \"Avocado is a well-known source of carotenoids, minerals, phenolics, vitamins, and fatty acids,\" wrote the authors of the Phytotherapy Research review. \"The lipid- lowering, antihypertensive, antidiabetic, anti-obesity, antithrombotic, antiatherosclerotic, and cardioprotective effects of avocado have been demonstrated in several studies.\"\r\n", "article_link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ptr.5805", "url": "http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-04/w-amh041017.php", "region": "namerica", "source_link": null, "funder": "", "meeting": "", "institution": "Wiley", "keywords": ["Food/Food Science", " Medicine/Health", " Public Health"], "journal": "", "description": "A new review investigates the effects of avocados on different components of  metabolic syndrome, which is a clustering of risk factors including high blood sugar, cholesterol, blood pressure, and body mass index.
