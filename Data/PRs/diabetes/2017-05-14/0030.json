Studies have also identified the mechanisms and cellular molecules involved.The review is published in the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences.\r\n", "article_link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nyas.13375", "url": "http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-05/w-gmh051617.php", "region": "namerica", "source_link": null, "funder": "", "meeting": "", "institution": "Wiley", "keywords": ["Medicine/Health", " Eating Disorders/Obesity", " Metabolism/Metabolic Diseases"], "journal": "Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences", "description": "A new review notes that recent epidemiological and clinical studies have built a consensus that ginger has beneficial effects against obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and related disorders -- more commonly referred to as metabolic syndrome.", "date": "Tue, 16 May 2017 04:00:00 GMT"}
