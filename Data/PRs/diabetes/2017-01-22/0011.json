The Fromson Fellowship is organized and implemented by American Associates, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (AABGU).This year, the Fromson Fellowship cohort will offer up to 10 selected science, health and medical journalists the opportunity to report on the myriad biomedical research projects and innovations that are being developed at or in partnership with BGU. Meetings will be held with top researchers and business leaders in the fields of biomedical engineering, robotics, nanomedicine, infectious diseases, sleep and nutrition, who will present new and soon-to-be-published research. Click here for the detailed preliminary itinerary.The Fellowship covers fellows' travel, accommodation and meal costs and includes a five-day program in Israel. In addition to meetings, there will be special excursions and time allotted for reporters to research or write. Reporters may also cover the Fellowship costs if publications require. Eligibility: The cohort is open to a limited number of pre-qualified medical/science journalists on staff at bona fide United States news media. Freelance writers must indicate evidence of bylined work pertaining to science, health, medicine, or biomedical research intended for the general public and published within the past year. Deadline: The cohort will be finalized on a rolling basis until Friday, February 17, 2017.For more information, contact: \r\nAndrew Lavin\r\nA.
