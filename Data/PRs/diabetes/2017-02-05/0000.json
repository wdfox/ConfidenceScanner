{"title": "Study provides new insights on how diabetes drug works", "text": "Many individuals with type 2 diabetes produce abnormally low levels of a gut hormone called GLP-1, which normally stimulates insulin release from the pancreas. Now a new study shows that GLP-1 production by special cells in the gut known as L-cells can be restored in patients with recent onset type 2 diabetes following three to 12 months of treatment with liraglutide, a drug that is similar to native GLP-1.\"This study shows that chronic liraglutide therapy induces a robust enhancement of GLP-1 secretion by the body that may hold implications for the long-term effects of this medication in patients,\" said Dr. Ravi Retnakaran, senior author of the Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism study.\r\n", "article_link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/dom.12838", "url": "http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-02/w-spn021017.php", "region": "namerica", "source_link": null, "funder": "", "meeting": "", "institution": "Wiley", "keywords": ["Medicine/Health", " Diabetes"], "journal": "Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism", "description": "Many individuals with type 2 diabetes produce abnormally low levels of a gut hormone called GLP-1, which normally stimulates insulin release from the pancreas.", "date": "Fri, 10 Feb 2017 05:00:00 GMT"}
