The team then used molecular techniques to determine which species they were and which hosts they had been feeding on. The scientists collected a total of 1,774 Anopheles culicifacies and 169 Anopheles fluviatilis mosquitoes across all study sites. They found that both species were denser in cattle sheds than in human dwellings, and both were feeding on humans and cattle.Next, the researchers used their field-collected data to help build a computer model that simulated the life of an adult mosquito. They used the model to explore how best to control the mosquitoes to have maximum impact on malaria transmission in these villages.\"Our model analysis suggests that conventional control tools -- such as insecticide-treated bed nets and indoor insecticide sprays -- are less effective when mosquitoes exhibit 'zoophilic' behaviors (having an attraction to nonhuman animals),\" said Thomas. \"However, extending controls to better target the zoophilic mosquitoes -- for example, by broadening coverage of non-repellant insecticide sprays to include cattle sheds -- could help reduce transmission dramatically.\" Waite added that the model suggests very little cattle-based vector control effort would be required to drive malaria transmission in the region to elimination. \"We show that directing even modest amounts of effort to specifically increase mosquito mortality associated with zoophilic behavior can shift the balance towards elimination,\" she said. The findings appear in today's (Jan. 16) Scientific Reports.\"Understanding the dynamic between humans, cattle and mosquitoes could have major implications for malaria control policy and practice, not only in India, but in other areas where transmission is sustained by zoophilic vectors,\" said Thomas. \"Specifically, optimizing use of existing tools will be essential to achieving the ambitious 2030 elimination target set by the World Health Organization, which aims to decrease malaria cases globally by 90 percent compared to 2015 levels and eliminate malaria in at least 35 additional countries, by 2030.\"", "meeting": "", "keywords": ["Entomology", " Medicine/Health", " Infectious/Emerging Diseases"]}
