Migraine was more common in the group of patients with CEAD ischemic stroke, mainly because of the frequency of migraine without aura, according to the results.Compared with migraine with aura, migraine without aura was associated with CEAD ischemic stroke and that association was higher in men and in patients 39 and younger, the article reports.The study has limitations, including that it did not assess migraine frequency and severity or the frequency of auras, so the authors could not evaluate whether the association they observed differs according to specific migraine patterns.\"Our data support consideration of a history of migraine as a marker for increased risk of IS [ischemic stroke] caused by CEAD, as well as a putative susceptibility factor for CEAD, regardless of its clinical features,\" the article concludes.\r\n\t", "meeting": "", "keywords": ["Medicine/Health", " Neurobiology"]}
