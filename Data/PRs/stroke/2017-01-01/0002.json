Their blood also has altered coagulation properties, which increases their risk of both bleeding and thrombotic events such as stroke. Because of these risks, a team led by Katharina Sch\u00fctt, MD and Georg Schlieper, MD (RWTH University Aachen, in Germany) investigated the impact of clot structure on health outcomes in hemodialysis patients. When the researchers analyzed the blood of 171 chronic hemodialysis patients, they found that the patients tended to have a denser clot structure than individuals without kidney disease. In addition, patients with such compact clots had an increased risk of dying from cardiovascular causes as well as an increased risk of dying from other causes. Finally, dialysis patients' fibrinogen--a protein that is converted into fibrin during blood clot formation--exhibited certain modifications that were different from fibrinogen from patients without kidney disease. \"Whether better dialysis treatment or medication could improve clot structure needs to be investigated in future studies,\" said Dr. Sch\u00fctt.", "meeting": "", "keywords": ["Medicine/Health"]}
