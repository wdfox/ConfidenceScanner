The loss of all one's teeth, called edentulism, impacts about one-third of U.S. adults 60 and older and often results from periodontal disease.\"Beside their negative impact on oral function and dietary habits, these conditions are also thought to be related to chronic diseases of aging,\" said Michael J. LaMonte, PhD, study author and research associate professor of epidemiology and environmental health in UB's School of Public Health and Health Professions.Researchers analyzed the health information from the Women's Health Initiative program -- a study of 57,001 women, 55 years and older.\"Previous studies included smaller sample sizes or had limited numbers of cardiovascular disease events for analysis. Ours is among the largest and focuses exclusively on postmenopausal women in whom periodontitis, total tooth loss and cardiovascular disease is high nationally,\" LaMonte said.In 6.7-year follow up of postmenopausal women studied, they found:\"Our findings suggest that older women may be at higher risk for death because of their periodontal condition and may benefit from more intensive oral screening measures,\" LaMonte said.\"However, studies of interventions aimed at improving periodontal health are needed to determine whether risk of death is lowered among those receiving the intervention compared to those who do not. Our study was not able to establish a direct cause and effect.\"", "meeting": "", "keywords": ["Medicine/Health", " Death/Dying", " Mortality/Longevity", " Dentistry/Periodontal Disease", " Gerontology", " Aging", " Public Health"]}
