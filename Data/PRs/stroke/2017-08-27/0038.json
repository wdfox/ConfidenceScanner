Between January 2008 and February 2015, patients with symptomatic aortic stenosis who underwent TAVI were enrolled in a Brazilian multicentre registry.Among a total of 819 patients, 735 were less than 90 years old, and 84 (10.2%) were nonagenarian. Nonagenarian patients were on average 12 years older than patients less 90 years old (92.4 years versus 80.1 years; p\r\n\tCompared with younger patients, nonagenarian patients were sicker (Society of Thoracic Surgeons' [STS] risk score of 13.19% versus 9.87%; p \r\n\tAt 30 days after TAVI, the rate of all-cause mortality was higher in the nonagenarian group (15.6% versus 8.4%; p=0.04). At one year, there were similar rates of death between nonagenarians and younger patients (20.9% vs. 21.8%) (figure 1). There were no differences in the rates of stroke, myocardial infarction or bleeding at 30 days and one year.After two years of follow-up, there was a higher mortality rate in nonagenarians, which likely reflects the shorter underlying life expectancy of these patients.Dr Caixeta said: \"In this real world observational study, nonagenarian patients who underwent TAVI had worse short-term outcomes but similar one-year clinical outcomes as patients younger than 90 years. The findings suggest that TAVI is safe and effective in nonagenarian patients with aortic stenosis and is not a futile treatment.\"", "meeting": "ESC Congress 2017", "keywords": ["Medicine/Health", " Cardiology", " Death/Dying", " Diet/Body Weight", " Health Professionals", " Disease in the Developing World"]}
