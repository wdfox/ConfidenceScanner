Parents completed a behavioral checklist at least 10 months after their child's stroke.Researchers found:Children with stroke had notably greater mood, anxiety, somatic (physical), oppositional defiance and conduct problems than children without stroke.\r\nChildren who had strokes at ages younger than six years had notably higher anxiety levels than older children who had stroke. That could be due to changes in family dynamics when young children suffer a neurological injury, researchers said.\r\n\"These results support the need for careful psychological follow-up in this vulnerable population,\" researchers said.", "meeting": "AHA/ASA International Stroke Conference 2017", "keywords": ["Medicine/Health", " Cardiology", " Stroke"]}
