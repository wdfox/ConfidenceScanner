Fifty were Mexican-American and 22 were non-Hispanic white. There were no ethnic differences among the patients who were discharged home without rehabilitation services.Researchers found:Among the 48 who received rehabilitation, 73 percent of non-Hispanic whites were discharged to inpatient rehabilitation, compared to 30 percent of Mexican-Americans.\r\nWhile none of the non-Hispanic whites studied received home rehabilitation after stroke, 51 percent of Mexican-American stroke patients received at-home rehab.\r\nThis disparity may, in part, explain why Mexican-Americans have worse neurologic, functional and cognitive results after stroke than non-Hispanic whites, researchers said.", "meeting": "AHA/ASA International Stroke Conference", "keywords": ["Medicine/Health", " Cardiology", " Stroke"]}
