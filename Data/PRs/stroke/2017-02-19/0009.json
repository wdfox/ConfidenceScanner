Glucose fuels brain activity.\r\nBoth e-Cig and tobacco smoke exposure for 30 days decreased Thrombomodulin (anti-coagulant) levels.From a brain health perspective, researchers said, electronic-cigarette vaping is not safer than tobacco smoking, and may pose a similar, if not higher risk for stroke severity.Use of e-cigarettes is a growing health concern in both smoking and nonsmoking populations. Researchers said rigorous studies are needed to investigate the effects of the nicotine exposure via e-cigarettes on brain and stroke outcome.", "meeting": "AHA/ASA International Stroke Conference 2017", "keywords": ["Medicine/Health", " Cardiology", " Stroke"]}
