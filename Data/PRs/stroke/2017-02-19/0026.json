Researchers analyzed the chemical components in HDL from the blood of Alzheimer's patients and compared them to HDL from healthy adults.They found that compared to healthy people, Alzheimer's patients had a 5.5 times increase of a dysfunctional HDL subfraction, as well as a decreased protein/lipid ratio.The associated reduction in proteins needed for brain function, such as albumin, and increase in proinflammatory components could favor inflammation in the brain and contribute to cognitive impairment.", "meeting": "AHA/ASA International Stroke Conference 2017", "keywords": ["Medicine/Health", " Cardiology", " Stroke"]}
