{"title": "Research suggests association between gut bacteria and emotion", "text": "FINDINGSBACKGROUNDBrain-gut-microbiota interactions may play an important role in human health and behavior. Previous research suggests that microbiota, a community of microorganisms in the gut, can influence behavior and emotion. Rodent models have demonstrated the effects of gut microbiota on emotional and social behaviors, such as anxiety and depression. There is, however, little evidence of this in humans.\r\nMETHODIMPACTThese results support the concept of brain-gut-microbiota interactions in healthy humans. Researchers do not yet know whether bacteria in the gut influence the development of the brain and its activity when unpleasant emotional content is encountered, or if existing differences in the brain influence the type of bacteria that reside in the gut. Both possibilities, however, could lead to important changes in how one thinks about human emotions.\r\n", "article_link": null, "url": "http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-06/uoc--rsa062717.php", "region": "namerica", "source_link": null, "funder": "Danone Research, National Institutes of Health, Ahmanson-Lovelace Brain Mapping Center", "meeting": "", "institution": "University of California - Los Angeles Health Sciences", "keywords": ["Medicine/Health", " Internal Medicine", " Gastroenterology", " Depression/Anger", " Memory/Cognitive Processes", " Perception/Awareness", " Stress/Anxiety"], "journal": "Psychosomatic Medicine: Journal of Biobehavioral Medicine", "description": "Researchers have identified gut microbiota that interact with brain regions associated with mood and behavior.
