{"title": "Quantifying nature's mental health benefits", "text": "The BioScience Talks podcast features discussions of topical issues related to the biological sciences.Nature's positive impact on mood is easily understood on an intuitive level, but a more fine-grain analysis reveals quantifiable effects with potentially serious implications for human well-being. For this episode of BioScience Talks, we are joined by Dr. Daniel Cox of the Environment and Sustainability Institute at the University of Exeter, in Penryn, United Kingdom. Writing for BioScience, Cox and his colleagues described recent work that found strong correlations between nature exposure and positive markers of mental health. In addition, the authors used dose-response modeling to uncover threshold effects that may help guide urban planning, with the ultimate goal of reducing the societal burdens of mental illness.To hear the whole discussion, visit this link for this latest episode of the BioScience Talks podcast.\r\n", "article_link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/biosci/biw173", "url": "http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-03/aiob-qnm030817.php", "region": "namerica", "source_link": null, "funder": "", "meeting": "", "institution": "American Institute of Biological Sciences", "keywords": ["Biology", " Biodiversity", " Environmental Health", " Social/Behavioral Science", " Urbanization", " Mental Health"], "journal": "BioScience", "description": "The BioScience Talks podcast features discussions of topical issues related to the biological sciences.", "date": "Wed, 08 Mar 2017 05:00:00 GMT"}
