Researchers at Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience developed a tool to identify and control neurons. The new technique, called Calcium and Light-Induced Gene Handling Toolkit or 'Cal-Light,' allows researchers to observe and manipulate the neural activities underlying behavior with never-before-seen specificity, hopefully allowing researchers to identify causality between neuronal activity and behavior.", "title": "New tool to identify and control neurons", "source_link": null, "institution": "Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience", "meeting": "", "text": "", "region": "namerica", "url": "http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-06/mpfi-ntt062217.php", "article_link": null, "date": "Mon, 26 Jun 2017 04:00:00 GMT"}
