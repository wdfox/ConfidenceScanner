They will decipher user's emotions, body language and social cues so they can tailor their interaction to the needs and moods of individuals.", "journal": "", "funder": "", "region": "namerica", "url": "http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-02/uosc-ucs021017.php", "institution": "University of Southern California", "meeting": "2017 AAAS Annual Meeting", "description": "A University of Southern California computer scientist will present her research on socially assistive robots on Friday, Feb. 17 at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in Boston.
