{"title": "Hypertension during pregnancy may affect women's long-term cardiovascular health", "text": "Women who experience hypertension during pregnancy face an increased risk of heart disease and hypertension later in life, according to a new study.Among 146,748 women with a first pregnancy and a follow-up of approximately four-and-a-half years, 997 were diagnosed with cardiovascular disease and 6812 developed hypertension. Compared with women without hypertension during pregnancy, those with hypertension during pregnancy had a 2.2-times higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease and a 5.6-times higher risk of developing hypertension after pregnancy. Subsequent pregnancies did not appear to influence these associations.\"This study highlights the need for long-term follow-up of women with a history of hypertension during pregnancy to provide early management of risk factors for cardiovascular disease,\" said Sonia Grandi, PhD candidate at McGill University and lead author of the Paediatric & Perinatal Epidemiology study.\r\n", "article_link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ppe.12388", "url": "http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-08/w-hdp081817.php", "region": "namerica", "source_link": null, "funder": "", "meeting": "", "institution": "Wiley", "keywords": ["Medicine/Health"], "journal": "Paediatric & Perinatal Epidemiology", "description": "Women who experience hypertension during pregnancy face an increased risk of heart disease and hypertension later in life, according to a new study.", "date": "Fri, 18 Aug 2017 04:00:00 GMT"}
