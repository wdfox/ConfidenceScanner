In the randomized study of 102 patients with epilepsy, the MCI did not significantly improve self-efficacy (confidence to manage medications and seizures), medication adherence, or quality of life when compared with usual care. Cost-effectiveness estimates for MCI however appeared promising.The MCI consisted of group sessions, a medication monitoring system, a smartphone application, and an internet accessible patient database.\r\n\"Based on the net benefits, irrespective of whether differences are statistically significant, the MCI may be a cost-effective alternative,\" said Ben Wijnen, MSc, lead author of the Epilepsia study.\r\n", "keywords": ["Medicine/Health", " Health Care Systems/Services", " Health Professionals"], "description": "A new study has found that a multi-component self-management intervention (MCI) for adults with epilepsy may be an important tool to increase efficiency in epilepsy care.", "date": "Wed, 07 Jun 2017 04:00:00 GMT"}
