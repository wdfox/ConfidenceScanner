Despite the anticipated growth of mental health needs as the U.S. population ages, there is only one geriatric psychiatrist for every 23,000 older Americans. By 2030, there will only be one geriatric psychiatrist for every 27,000 adults 65 and older. How is the health care system expected to rapidly close this gap for the mental health needs of older adults?A new pocket guide to elder mental health has been written with the express purpose of rapidly teaching all health care professionals the basics of diagnosing and treating mental health disorders in individuals over age 65. The easy to navigate volume is written for primary care doctors and mental health professionals, as well as those in various internal medicine specialties, surgery, nursing and pharmacy. It is also designed to be accessible to family members and caregivers. The book's main purpose is to ensure information critical to the diagnosis and treatment of older adult is accessible to everyone who is involved in caring for an older adult--not just to those with geriatrics training.Is the elder mentally altered due to prescription or over-the-counter drugs which negatively impact the aging brain? Are there sleep problems? Is the elder suffering from post-hospitalization delirium? Does he or she have dementia?\"Most older adults are seen by primary care physicians. Too often these busy physicians are juggling the patient's multiple physical problems, and incorrectly diagnose mental health issues as irreversible cognitive impairment,\" said Sophia Wang, MD, an implementation scientist with the Indiana University Center for Health Innovation and Implementation Science and an assistant professor of clinical psychiatry at IU School of Medicine. \"Because dementia is so common in older adults, clinicians may incorrectly diagnose it without ruling out other problems that we know can be reversed -- for example depression, sleep disorders, drug effects or alcohol.
