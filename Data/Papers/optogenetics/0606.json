It is uniquely situated to modulate the flow of sensory information from the surroundings to the cortex as well as influencing ongoing cortical activity by modulating cortico-thalamo-cortical transmission. Although the thinness, architecture and location of the TRN deep in the brain has previously made this a difficult structure to study, novel optical and genetic tools have allowed for more precise targeting of this area. Recent research has implicated a role for the TRN in attention and sleep. Interestingly, impairments in attention and sleep resulting from TRN perturbation are strikingly similar to the clinical deficits observed in schizophrenia. This review aims to discuss recent evidence for the role of TRN in attention and sleep born from optogenetic work and connect these findings with those clinically observed in schizophrenia.", "doi": "10.1016/j.schres.2016.07.011", "title": "Implications for the thalamic reticular nucleus in impaired attention and sleep in schizophrenia.", "journal": ["Schizophrenia research", "Schizophr.
