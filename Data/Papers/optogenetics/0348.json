Physiological cellular assays probe functional phenotypes that connect genomic data to patient health. Optogenetic tools, in particular tools for all-optical electrophysiology, now provide a means to probe cellular disease models with unprecedented throughput and information content. These techniques promise to identify functional phenotypes associated with disease states and to identify compounds that improve cellular function regardless of whether the compound acts directly on a target or through a bypass mechanism. This review discusses opportunities and unresolved challenges in applying optogenetic techniques throughout the discovery pipeline - from target identification and validation, to target-based and phenotypic screens, to clinical trials.", "doi": "10.1016/j.tibtech.2017.04.002", "title": "Optogenetic Approaches to Drug Discovery in Neuroscience and Beyond.", "journal": ["Trends in biotechnology", "Trends Biotechnol."]}
