This capacity is vulnerable in neuropsychiatric disorders and in\u00a0the aftermath of chronic stress, in which aberrant\u00a0choices and high-risk behaviors occur. We\u00a0report that chronic stress exposure in rodents produces abnormal evaluation of costs and benefits\u00a0resembling non-optimal decision-making in which\u00a0choices\u00a0of high-cost/high-reward options are sharply increased. Concomitantly, alterations in the task-related spike activity of medial prefrontal neurons correspond with increased activity of their striosome-predominant striatal projection neuron targets and with decreased and delayed striatal fast-firing interneuron activity. These effects of chronic stress on prefronto-striatal circuit dynamics could be blocked or be mimicked by selective optogenetic manipulation of these circuits. We suggest that altered excitation-inhibition dynamics of striosome-based circuit function could be an underlying mechanism by which chronic stress contributes to disorders characterized by aberrant decision-making under conflict.
