We tested a neural mass model by comparing the result of activation and inhibition of inhibitory neurons in silico with recently published results of optogenetic manipulation of glycinergic neurons [Sherman, et al. (2015) Nat Neurosci 18:408]. The comparison revealed that a five-cell type model consisting of three classes of inhibitory neurons [I-DEC, E-AUG, E-DEC (PI)] and two excitatory populations (pre-I/I) and (I-AUG) neurons can be applied to explain experimental observations made by stimulating or inhibiting inhibitory neurons by light sensitive ion channels.", "doi": "10.1016/j.neuroscience.2017.01.041", "title": "A computational model of the respiratory network challenged and optimized by data from optogenetic manipulation of glycinergic neurons.", "journal": ["Neuroscience", "Neuroscience"]}
