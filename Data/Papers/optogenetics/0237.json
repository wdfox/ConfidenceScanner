The liquid lens is formed by the interface between two immiscible liquids which are contained in a conically tapered lens cavity etched into a fused silica substrate. Interdigitated electrodes have been patterned along the sidewall of the taper to control the liquid lens curvature and tilt. Microlenses with apertures ranging in size from 30 to 80 \u03bcm were fabricated and tunable focusing ranging from 0.25 to 3 mm and beam steering of \u00b1 1 degree have been demonstrated.", "doi": null, "title": "Fluidic microoptics with adjustable focusing and beam steering for single cell optogenetics.", "journal": ["Optics express", "Opt Express"]}
