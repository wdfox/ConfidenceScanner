The gut has a complex cellular composition, and methods to study diverse multicellular interactions during physiological gut functions have been limited. However, new technologies are emerging in optics, genetics, and bioengineering that greatly expand the capabilities to study integrative functions in the gut. In this mini-review, I discuss several areas where the application of these technologies could benefit ongoing efforts to understand enteric neuromuscular function. I specifically focus on technologies that can be applied to study specific cellular networks and the mechanisms that link activity to function.", "doi": "10.1152/ajpgi.00049.2017", "title": "Emerging tools to study enteric neuromuscular function.", "journal": ["American journal of physiology.
