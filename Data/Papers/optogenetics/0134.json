Light activation of \u03b2-cells triggered a suppression of \u03b1-cell activity via gap junction-dependent activation of \u03b4-cells. Mathematical modelling of human islets suggests that 23% of the inhibitory effect of glucose on glucagon secretion is mediated by \u03b2-cells via gap junction-dependent activation of \u03b4-cells/somatostatin secretion.Glucagon, the body's principal hyperglycaemic hormone, is released from \u03b1-cells of the pancreatic islet. Secretion of this hormone is dysregulated in type 2 diabetes mellitus but the mechanisms controlling secretion are not well understood. Regulation of glucagon secretion by factors secreted by neighbouring \u03b2- and \u03b4-cells (paracrine regulation) have been proposed to be important. In this study, we explored the importance of paracrine regulation by using an optogenetic strategy. Specific light-induced activation of \u03b2-cells in mouse islets expressing the light-gated channelrhodopsin-2 resulted in stimulation of electrical activity in \u03b4-cells but suppression of \u03b1-cell activity. Activation of the \u03b4-cells was rapid and sensitive to the gap junction inhibitor carbenoxolone, whereas the effect on electrical activity in \u03b1-cells was blocked by CYN 154806, an antagonist of the somatostatin-2 receptor. These observations indicate that optogenetic activation of the \u03b2-cells propagates to the \u03b4-cells via gap junctions, and the consequential stimulation of somatostatin secretion inhibits \u03b1-cell electrical activity by a paracrine mechanism. To explore whether this pathway is important for regulating \u03b1-cell activity and glucagon secretion in human islets, we constructed computational models of human islets. These models had detailed architectures based on human islets and consisted of a collection of >500 \u03b1-, \u03b2- and \u03b4-cells. Simulations of these models revealed that this gap junctional/paracrine mechanism accounts for up to 23% of the suppression of glucagon secretion by high glucose.", "doi": "10.1113/JP274581", "title": "\u03b4-cells and \u03b2-cells are electrically coupled and regulate \u03b1-cell activity via somatostatin.", "journal": ["The Journal of physiology", "J.
