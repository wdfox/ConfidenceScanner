To this end, we adapted a GFP-based calcium reporter to luciferase that was expressed in small subsets of circadian neurons. This Tric-LUC reporter allowed a direct comparison of luciferase activity with locomotor activity, which was assayed in the same flies with video recording. The LUC profile from activity-promoting E cells paralleled evening locomotor activity, and the LUC profile from sleep-promoting glutamatergic DN1s (gDN1s) paralleled daytime sleep. Similar profiles were generated by novel reporters recently identified based on transcription factor activation. As E cell and gDN1 activity is necessary and sufficient for normal evening locomotor activity and daytime sleep profiles, respectively, we suggest that their luciferase profiles reflect their neuronal calcium and in some cases firing profiles in wake-behaving flies.", "doi": "10.1073/pnas.1706608114", "title": "Temporal calcium profiling of specific circadian neurons in freely moving flies.", "journal": ["Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "Proc.
