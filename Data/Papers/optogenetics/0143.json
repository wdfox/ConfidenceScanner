Distinct inputs depolarize TRN on multiple time scales, including thalamocortical afferents, corticothalamic 'feedback', and neuromodulation. Here, we systematically tested the concurrent and after-effects of depolarization duration on TRN firing in vivo using selective optogenetic drive. In VGAT-ChR2 mice, we isolated TRN single units (SU: N\u202f=\u202f100 neurons) that responded at brief latency (\u22645\u202fms) to stimulation. These units, and multi-unit activity (MUA) on corresponding electrodes, were analyzed in detail. Consistent with prior findings in relay neurons, after light cessation, burst-like events occurred in 74% of MUA sites, and 16% of SU. Increasing optical duration from 2 to 330\u202fms enhanced this burst probability, and decreased the latency to the first burst after stimulation. During stimulation, neurons demonstrated a 'plateau' firing response lasting 20-30\u202fms in response to light, but significant heterogeneity existed in the minimal stimuli required to drive this response. Two distinct types were evident, more sensitive 'non-linear' neurons that were driven to the plateau response by 2 or 5\u202fms pulses, versus 'linear' neurons that fired proportionally to optical duration, and reached the plateau with \u223c20-ms optical drive. Non-linear neurons showed higher evoked firing rates and burst probability, but spontaneous rate did not differ between types. These findings provide direct predictions for TRN responses to a range of natural depolarizing inputs, and a guide for the optical control of this key structure in studies of network function and behavior.", "doi": "10.1016/j.neuroscience.2017.09.038", "title": "Systematic examination of the impact of depolarization duration on thalamic reticular nucleus firing in vivo.", "journal": ["Neuroscience", "Neuroscience"]}
