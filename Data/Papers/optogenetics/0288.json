Axotomy activates an\u00a0intrinsic pro-degenerative axon death signaling cascade involving loss of the NAD+ biosynthetic enzyme Nmnat/Nmnat2 in axons, activation of dSarm/Sarm1, and subsequent Sarm-dependent depletion of NAD+. Here we identify Axundead (Axed) as a mediator of axon death. axed mutants suppress axon death in several types of axons for the lifespan of the fly and block the pro-degenerative effects of activated dSarm in\u00a0vivo. Neurodegeneration induced by loss of the sole fly Nmnat ortholog is also\u00a0fully blocked by axed, but not dsarm, mutants. Thus, pro-degenerative pathways activated by dSarm signaling or Nmnat elimination ultimately converge on Axed. Remarkably, severed axons morphologically preserved by axon death pathway mutations remain integrated in circuits and able to elicit complex behaviors after stimulation, indicating that blockade of axon\u00a0death signaling results in long-term functional preservation of axons.", "doi": "10.1016/j.neuron.2017.06.031", "title": "Axon Death Pathways Converge on Axundead to Promote Functional and Structural Axon Disassembly.", "journal": ["Neuron", "Neuron"]}
