Using an optogenetic approach, we demonstrate that LTMRs do not solely serve as\u00a0touch receptors but also play an important role\u00a0in acute pain signaling. We show that selective activation of neuropeptide Y receptor-2-expressing (Npy2r) myelinated A-fiber nociceptors evokes abnormally exacerbated pain, which is alleviated by concurrent activation of LTMRs in a frequency-dependent manner. We further show that spatial summation of single action potentials from multiple NPY2R-positive afferents is sufficient to trigger nocifensive paw withdrawal, but additional simultaneous sensory input from LTMRs is required for normal well-coordinated execution of this reflex. Thus, our results show that combinatorial coding of noxious and tactile sensory input is required for normal acute mechanical pain signaling. Additionally, we established a causal link between precisely defined neural activity in functionally identified sensory neuron subpopulations and nocifensive behavior and pain.", "doi": "10.1016/j.neuron.2016.11.027", "title": "Touch Receptor-Derived Sensory Information Alleviates Acute Pain Signaling and Fine-Tunes Nociceptive Reflex Coordination.", "journal": ["Neuron", "Neuron"]}
