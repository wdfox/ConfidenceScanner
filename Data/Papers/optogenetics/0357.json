In the past few years, remarkable progress has been made in engineering photoactivatable systems regulating the activity of cellular proteins. In this review, we discuss general strategies in designing and optimizing such optogenetic tools and highlight recent advances in the field, with specific focus on applications regulating protein catalytic activity.", "doi": "10.1016/j.cbpa.2017.05.001", "title": "Engineering genetically-encoded tools for optogenetic control of protein activity.", "journal": ["Current opinion in chemical biology", "Curr Opin Chem Biol"]}
