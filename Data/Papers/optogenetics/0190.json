Optogenetics offers cell-type specific neural control with millisecond precision, making it a powerful neural modulation technique. Combining optogenetics with the nonhuman primate model promises to lead to significant advances in both basic and applied research. In the past few years, optogenetics has made considerable progress in the nonhuman primate. Here, we systematically review the current state-of-art of optogenetics in the nonhuman primate with an emphasis on behavioral manipulation. Given its recent successes, we believe that the progress in the nonhuman primate will boost the translation of optogenetics to clinical applications in the near future.", "doi": "10.1177/1073858417728459", "title": "Behavioral Manipulation by Optogenetics in the Nonhuman Primate.", "journal": ["The Neuroscientist : a review journal bringing neurobiology, neurology and psychiatry", "Neuroscientist"]}
