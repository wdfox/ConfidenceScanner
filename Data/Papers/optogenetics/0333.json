Neuromodulation by nonpharmacological methods is emerging as a novel therapeutic strategy to treat inflammatory diseases. Recently, our group and others have demonstrated that vagus nerve stimulation and pulsed ultrasound ameliorated inflammation via the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP) in various animal models, including renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. Delineating the precise mechanisms by which these methods activate the CAP and ameliorate inflammation is mandatory for the broad clinical application in the future. Novel techniques, such as optogenetics, are expected to elucidate these complex mechanisms.", "doi": "10.1159/000477218", "title": "Nonpharmacological, Biomechanical Approaches to Control Inflammation in Acute Kidney Injury.", "journal": ["Nephron", "Nephron"]}
