Understanding how antagonism of NMDARs alters synapse and circuit function is pivotal to developing circuit-based therapies for depression. Using virally induced gene deletion, ex\u00a0vivo optogenetic-assisted circuit analysis, and in\u00a0vivo chemogenetics and fMRI, we assessed the role of NMDARs in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in controlling depression-related behavior in mice. We demonstrate that post-developmental genetic deletion of the NMDAR subunit GluN2B from pyramidal neurons in the mPFC enhances connectivity between the mPFC and limbic thalamus, but not the ventral hippocampus, and reduces depression-like behavior. Using intersectional chemogenetics, we show that activation of this thalamocortical circuit is sufficient to elicit a decrease in despair-like behavior. Our findings reveal that GluN2B exerts input-specific control of pyramidal neuron innervation and identify a medial dorsal thalamus (MDT)\u2192mPFC circuit that controls depression-like behavior.", "doi": "10.1016/j.celrep.2017.08.002", "title": "Synaptic Regulation of a Thalamocortical Circuit Controls Depression-Related Behavior.", "journal": ["Cell reports", "Cell Rep"]}
