Each vibrissa is densely innervated by multiple different types of trigeminal (TG) sensory neurons. Based on the sensory ending morphology, there are at least six types of vibrissa innervating neurons; whereas based on electrophysiological recordings, vibrissa neurons are generally classified as rapidly adapting (RA) and slowly adapting (SA), and show different responses to whisking movement and/or touch. There is a clear missing link between the morphologically defined neuronal types and their exact physiological properties and functions. We briefly summarize recent advances and consider single-cell transcriptome profiling, together with optogenetics-assisted in vivo electrophysiology, as a way to fill this major gap in our knowledge of the vibrissa sensory system.", "doi": "10.1016/j.neuroscience.2017.06.033", "title": "Vibrissa sensory neurons: Linking distinct morphology to specific physiology and function.", "journal": ["Neuroscience", "Neuroscience"]}
