Elucidating these roles has been hampered by a lack of techniques for manipulating spiking activity in these cells selectively-a problem common to most cell types in non-transgenic animals. To overcome this obstacle, we constructed AAV vectors carrying the channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) gene under the control of a 1 kb L7/Pcp2 promoter.\u00a0We\u00a0injected these vectors into the cerebellar cortex\u00a0of\u00a0rhesus macaques and tested vector efficacy\u00a0in three ways. Immunohistochemical analyses confirmed selective ChR2 expression in Purkinje cells. Neurophysiological recordings confirmed robust optogenetic activation. Optical stimulation of the oculomotor vermis caused saccade dysmetria. Our results demonstrate the utility of AAV-L7-ChR2 for revealing the contributions of Purkinje cells to circuit function and behavior, and they attest to the feasibility of promoter-based, targeted, genetic manipulations in primates.", "doi": "10.1016/j.neuron.2017.06.002", "title": "Selective Optogenetic Control of Purkinje Cells in Monkey Cerebellum.", "journal": ["Neuron", "Neuron"]}
