Abundant tools for optogenetic excitation are available, but the limitations of current optogenetic inhibitors present an obstacle to demonstrating the necessity of neuronal circuits. Here we show that anion channelrhodopsins can be used to specifically and rapidly inhibit neural systems involved in Drosophila locomotion, wing expansion, memory retrieval and gustation, thus demonstrating their broad utility in the circuit analysis of behavior.", "doi": "10.1038/nmeth.4148", "title": "Optogenetic inhibition of behavior with anion channelrhodopsins.", "journal": ["Nature methods", "Nat.
