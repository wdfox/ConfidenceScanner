Both techniques involve the genetic delivery of artificial proteins (opsins or engineered receptors) that are expressed on a selective population of neurons. The firing of these neurons can then be manipulated using light sources (for opsins) or by systemic administration of exogenous compounds (for chemogenetic receptors). Opto- and chemogenetic tools have enabled many important advances in basal ganglia research in rodent models, yet these techniques have faced a slow progress in non-human primate (NHP) research. In this review, we present a summary of the current state of these techniques in NHP research and outline some of the main challenges associated with the use of these genetic-based approaches in monkeys. We also explore cutting-edge developments that will facilitate the use of opto- and chemogenetics in NHPs, and help advance our understanding of basal ganglia circuits in normal and pathological conditions.", "doi": "10.1007/s00702-017-1697-8", "title": "Advances in optogenetic and chemogenetic methods to study brain circuits in non-human primates.", "journal": ["Journal of neural transmission (Vienna, Austria : 1996)", "J Neural Transm (Vienna)"]}
