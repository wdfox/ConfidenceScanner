However, their study has been limited by the lack of tools to manipulate their occurrence in live cells spatiotemporally. Here, we report the development of a genetically encoded light-inducible tethering (LIT) system allowing the induction of contacts between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, taking advantage of a pair of light-dependent heterodimerization called an iLID system. We demonstrate that the iLID-based LIT approach enables control of ER-mitochondria tethering with high spatiotemporal precision in various cell types including primary neurons, which will facilitate the functional study of ER-mitochondrial contacts.", "doi": "10.1021/acssynbio.7b00248", "title": "Optogenetic Control of Endoplasmic Reticulum-Mitochondria Tethering.", "journal": ["ACS synthetic biology", "ACS Synth Biol"]}
