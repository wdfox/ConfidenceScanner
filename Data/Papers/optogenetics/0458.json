Its potential clinical translation for brain neuromodulation requires a careful assessment of the safety and efficacy of repeated, sustained optical stimulation of large volumes of brain tissues. This study was performed in rats and not in non-human primates for ethical reasons. We studied the spatial distribution of light, potential damage, and non-physiological effects in vivo, in anesthetized rat brains, on large brain volumes, following repeated high irradiance photo-stimulation. We generated 2D irradiance and temperature increase surface maps based on recordings taken during optical stimulation using irradiance and temporal parameters representative of common optogenetics experiments. Irradiances of 100 to 600\u2009mW/mm2 with 5\u2009ms pulses at 20, 40, and 60\u2009Hz were applied during 90\u2009s. In vivo electrophysiological recordings and post-mortem histological analyses showed that high power light stimulation had no obvious phototoxic effects and did not trigger non-physiological functional activation. This study demonstrates the ability to illuminate cortical layers to a depth of several millimeters using pulsed red light without detrimental thermal damages.", "doi": "10.1038/srep43997", "title": "Experimental assessment of the safety and potential efficacy of high irradiance photostimulation of brain tissues.", "journal": ["Scientific reports", "Sci Rep"]}
