We developed a three-step engineering strategy to construct an optogenetic PKA (optoPKA) and demonstrated that, upon illumination, optoPKA migrates to specified intracellular sites. Furthermore, we designed intracellular spatially segregated reporters of PKA activity and confirmed that optoPKA phosphorylates these reporters in a light-dependent fashion. Finally, proteomics experiments reveal that light activation of optoPKA results in the phosphorylation of known endogenous PKA substrates as well as potential novel substrates.", "doi": "10.1016/j.chembiol.2017.09.011", "title": "Design and Profiling of a Subcellular Targeted Optogenetic cAMP-Dependent Protein Kinase.", "journal": ["Cell chemical biology", "Cell Chem Biol"]}
