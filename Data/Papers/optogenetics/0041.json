However, how the central amygdala participates in such a learning process remains unclear. Here we show that PKC-\u03b4-expressing central amygdala neurons are essential for the synaptic plasticity underlying learning in the lateral amygdala, as they convey information about the unconditioned stimulus to lateral amygdala neurons during fear conditioning.", "doi": "10.1038/s41593-017-0009-9", "title": "The central amygdala controls learning in the lateral amygdala.", "journal": ["Nature neuroscience", "Nat.
