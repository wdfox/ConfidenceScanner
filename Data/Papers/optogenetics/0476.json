We review current perspectives on the neural systems that regulate sleep/wake states in mammals and the circadian mechanisms that control their timing. We also outline key models for the regulation of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-REM sleep, how mutual inhibition between specific pathways gives rise to these distinct states, and how dysfunction in these circuits can give rise to sleep disorders.", "doi": "10.1016/j.neuron.2017.01.014", "title": "Neural Circuitry of Wakefulness and Sleep.", "journal": ["Neuron", "Neuron"]}
