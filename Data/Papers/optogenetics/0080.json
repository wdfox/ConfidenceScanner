Over the last 50 years, studies in animal models have allowed us to identify critical CNS regions involved in these processes and even crucial cell populations. Now, techniques for genetically and anatomically targeted manipulation of specific neural populations using light (optogenetic), ligands (chemogenetic), or magnetic fields (radiogenetic/magnetogenetic) allow detailed investigation of circuits involved in metabolic regulation. In this review, we provide a brief overview of recent studies using light- and magnetic field-regulated neural activity to investigate the neural circuits contributing to metabolic control.", "doi": "10.1111/nyas.13468", "title": "Investigating metabolic regulation using targeted neuromodulation.", "journal": ["Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences", "Ann.
