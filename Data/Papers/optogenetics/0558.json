Here, we present a noninvasive, ultrasound-based technique to introduce optogenetic channels into the brain by temporarily opening the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We demonstrate the efficiency of the method developed and evaluate the bioactivity of the non-invasively introduced channelrhodopsin channels by performing stimulation in freely behaving mice.", "doi": "10.1038/srep39955", "title": "Non-invasive, Focused Ultrasound-Facilitated Gene Delivery for Optogenetics.", "journal": ["Scientific reports", "Sci Rep"]}
