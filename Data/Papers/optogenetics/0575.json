Here we systematically optimize the system's three main components to develop a temperature-optimized GAL4-UAS system (cGAL) that robustly controls gene expression in C. elegans from 15 to 25 \u00b0C. We demonstrate this system's utility in transcriptional reporter analysis, site-of-action experiments and exogenous transgene expression; and we provide a basic driver and effector toolkit.", "doi": "10.1038/nmeth.4109", "title": "cGAL, a temperature-robust GAL4-UAS system for Caenorhabditis elegans.", "journal": ["Nature methods", "Nat.
