Chains of ripples (ripple bursts) in CA1 have been reported to co-occur with long-range place cell sequence replays during the quiet awake state, but roles of neural inputs to CA1 in ripple bursts and replays are unknown. Here we show that ripple bursts in CA1 and medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) are temporally associated. An inhibition of MECIII input to CA1 during quiet awake reduced ripple bursts in CA1 and restricted the spatial coverage of replays to a shorter distance corresponding to single ripple events. The reduction did not occur with MECIII input inhibition during slow-wave sleep. Inhibition of CA3 activity suppressed ripples and replays in CA1 regardless of behavioral state. Thus, MECIII input to CA1 is crucial for ripple bursts and long-range replays specifically in quiet awake, whereas CA3 input is essential for both, regardless of behavioral state.", "doi": "10.1016/j.neuron.2017.09.017", "title": "Direct Medial Entorhinal Cortex Input to Hippocampal CA1 Is Crucial for Extended Quiet Awake Replay.", "journal": ["Neuron", "Neuron"]}
