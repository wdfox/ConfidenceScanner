Optogenetic tools are being developed to address neuroscience challenges, and to improve the knowledge about brain networks, with the ultimate aim of catalyzing new treatments for brain disorders and diseases. To reach this ambitious goal the implementation of mature and reliable engineered tools is required. The success of optogenetics relies on optical tools that can deliver light into the neural tissue. Objective/Approach: Here, the design and manufacturing approaches available to the scientific community are reviewed, and current challenges to accomplish appropriate scalable, multimodal and wireless optical devices are discussed.Overall, this review aims at presenting a helpful guidance to the engineering and design of optical microsystems for optogenetic applications.", "doi": "10.1088/1741-2552/aa7004", "title": "Design and manufacturing challenges of optogenetic neural interfaces: a review.", "journal": ["Journal of neural engineering", "J Neural Eng"]}
