This uncertainty stems from the unpredictable timing of seizures in most models, which limits\u00a0neuronal imaging or manipulations around the seizure onset. Here, we describe a mouse model for optogenetic seizure induction. Combining this with calcium imaging, we find that seizure onset rapidly recruits parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SOM), and vasoactive intestinal peptitde (VIP)-expressing interneurons, whereas excitatory neurons are recruited several seconds later. Optogenetically inhibiting VIP interneurons consistently increased seizure threshold and reduced seizure duration. Inhibiting PV+ and SOM+ interneurons had mixed effects on seizure initiation but consistently reduced seizure duration. Thus, while their roles may evolve during seizures, PV+ and SOM+ interneurons ultimately help maintain ongoing seizures. These results show how an optogenetically induced seizure model can be leveraged to pinpoint a new target for seizure control: VIP interneurons.
