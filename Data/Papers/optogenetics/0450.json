Since the discovery of channelrhodopsin has pioneered the field, the optogenetic toolkit has been ever expanding and allows now not only to control neuronal activity by light, but rather a multitude of other cellular functions. One important application that has been established in recent years is the light-dependent control of second messenger signaling. The optogenetic toolkit now allows to control cyclic nucleotide-dependent signaling by light in vitro and in vivo.", "doi": "10.1016/j.copbio.2017.02.014", "title": "How to control cyclic nucleotide signaling by light.", "journal": ["Current opinion in biotechnology", "Curr.
