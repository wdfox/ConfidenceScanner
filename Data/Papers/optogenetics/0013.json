In addition to neurones, also non-neuronal brain cells (astrocytes and microglia) are emerging as potential players. New techniques, particularly optogenetics and designed receptors activated by artificial ligands (DREADD), have provided also sleep research with important additional tools to study the effect of either silencing or activating specific neuronal groups/neuronal networks by opening or shutting ion channels on cells. The advantages of these strategies are the possibility to genetically target specific cell populations and the possibility to either activate or inhibit them with inducing light signal into the brain. Studies probing circuits of NREM and REM sleep regulation, as well as their role in memory consolidation, have been conducted recently. In addition, fundamentally new thoughts and potential mechanisms have been introduced to the field. The role of non-neuronal tissues in the regulation of many brain functions has become evident. These non-neuronal cells, particularly astrocytes, integrate large number of neurones, and it has been suggested that one of their functions is to integrate the (neural) activity in larger brain areas-a feature that is one of the prominent features of also the state of sleep.", "doi": "10.1111/apha.13017", "title": "Novel concepts in sleep regulation.", "journal": ["Acta physiologica (Oxford, England)", "Acta Physiol (Oxf)"]}
