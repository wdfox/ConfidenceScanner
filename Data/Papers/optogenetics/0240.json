To expand the colour palette of available cAMP indicators, we developed a red cAMP indicator named \"Pink Flamindo\" (Pink Fluorescent cAMP indicator). The fluorescence intensity of Pink Flamindo increases 4.2-fold in the presence of a saturating dose of cAMP, with excitation and emission peaks at 567\u2009nm and 590\u2009nm, respectively. Live-cell imaging revealed that Pink Flamindo is effective for monitoring the spatio-temporal dynamics of intracellular cAMP generated by photoactivated adenylyl cyclase in response to blue light, and in dual-colour imaging studies using a green Ca2+ indicator (G-GECO). Furthermore, we successfully monitored the elevation of cAMP levels in vivo in cerebral cortical astrocytes by two-photon imaging. We propose that Pink Flamindo will facilitate future in vivo, optogenetic studies of cell signalling and cAMP dynamics.", "doi": "10.1038/s41598-017-07820-6", "title": "Red fluorescent protein-based cAMP indicator applicable to optogenetics and in vivo imaging.", "journal": ["Scientific reports", "Sci Rep"]}
