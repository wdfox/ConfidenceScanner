To date, most literature suggests that neurons are not phagocytic cells capable of internalizing microparticles larger than 0.5\u00a0\u03bcm. We report that neurons transport fluorescently labeled silica microspheres with diameters of 1-2\u00a0\u03bcm into neurons in vitro and in rat brain without having overt effects on cell viability. Using flow cytometry, fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and confocal and electron microscopy, we first found that SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells internalized 1-\u03bcm silicon microspheres with surface charges of -70\u00a0mV (hydroxyl and carboxyl), -30\u00a0mV (amino), and +40\u00a0mV (ammonio). Uptake was rapid, within 2-4\u00a0h, and did not affect cell viability 48\u00a0h later. Flow cytometry assays indicate that SH-SY5Y cells internalize 1- and 1.5-\u03bcm microspheres at the same rate over a 24-h incubation period. Electron microscopy confirms that SH-SY5Y cells internalize 1-, 1.5-, and 2-\u03bcm microspheres. Confocal microscopy demonstrated that primary cortical neurons also internalized 1-, 1.5-, and 2-\u03bcm amino microspheres within 4\u00a0h. Finally, we injected 1-\u03bcm amino microspheres into rat striatum and found microspheres inside neurons. Overall, neurons can internalize microspheres up to 2\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter with a range of surface chemical groups and charges. These findings allow a host of neuroscience and neuroengineering applications including intracellular microdevices within neurons.", "doi": "10.1007/s10571-017-0479-z", "title": "Neurons Internalize Functionalized Micron-Sized Silicon Dioxide Microspheres.", "journal": ["Cellular and molecular neurobiology", "Cell.
