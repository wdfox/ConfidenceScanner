It has numerous applications in both basic and clinical science. These applications require stimulating devices with small processors that can perform real-time neural signal processing, deliver high-intensity light with high spatial and temporal resolution, and do not consume a lot of power. In this paper, we demonstrate the implementation of neuronal models in a platform consisting of an embedded system module and a portable digital light processing projector. As a replacement for damaged neural circuitry, the embedded module processes neural signals and then directs the projector to optogenetically activate a downstream neural pathway. We present a design in the context of stimulating circuits in the visual system, but the approach is feasible for a broad range of biomedical applications.", "doi": "10.1109/TNSRE.2017.2763130", "title": "An Embedded Real-Time Processing Platform for Optogenetic Neuroprosthetic Applications.", "journal": ["IEEE transactions on neural systems and rehabilitation engineering : a publication of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society", "IEEE Trans Neural Syst Rehabil Eng"]}
