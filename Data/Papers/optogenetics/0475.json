Optogenetics results from the fruitful combination of optics and genetic engineering, maximizing the advantages of each discipline. These advantages are optical control through the manipulation of wavelength and light intensity on the millisecond timescale, and specific gene expression and gene product trafficking with subcellular precision. This kind of fine-tuning cannot be achieved using traditional methods. Therefore, optogenetic techniques have brought a revolution to neuroscience. In this review, we provide a concise summary of the history and recent advances of optogenetics, focusing in particular on applications for psychiatric research.", "doi": "10.1111/pcn.12516", "title": "Optogenetics: Applications in psychiatric research.", "journal": ["Psychiatry and clinical neurosciences", "Psychiatry Clin.
