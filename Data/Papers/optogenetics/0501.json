Here, we report on an alternate optogenetic method for the activation of Ca2+ and voltage-dependent large conductance (BK) potassium channels. This was achieved through the use of the light-gated channelrhodopsin 2 variant, CatCh(Calcium translocating Channelrhodopsin) with enhanced Ca, which produces locally [Ca2+] in the \u03bcM range on the inner side of the membrane, without significant [Ca2+] increase in the cytosol. BK channel subunits \u03b1 and \u03b21 were expressed together with CatCh in HEK293 cells, and voltage and Ca2+ dependence were analyzed. Light activation of endogenous BK channels under native conditions in astrocytes and glioma cells was also investigated. Additionally, BK channels were used as sensors for the calibration of the [Ca2+] on the inner surface of the cell membrane.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jmb.2017.02.004", "title": "Optogenetic Control of Ca2+ and Voltage-Dependent Large Conductance (BK) Potassium Channels.", "journal": ["Journal of molecular biology", "J.
