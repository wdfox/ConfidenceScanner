Single-recombinase-dependent expression systems have been widely used as a means to restrict gene expression based on single features by combining recombinase-dependent viruses with recombinase-expressing transgenic animals. This protocol details how to create INTRSECT constructs and use multiple recombinases to achieve targeting of a desired gene to subsets of neurons that are defined by multiple genetic and/or topological features. This method includes the design and utilization of both viruses and transgenic animals: these tools are inherently flexible and modular and may be used in different combinations to achieve the desired gene expression pattern. \u00a9 2017 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.", "doi": "10.1002/cpns.30", "title": "A Guide to Creating and Testing New INTRSECT Constructs.", "journal": ["Current protocols in neuroscience", "Curr Protoc Neurosci"]}
