The latest generation of those light-regulated systems that are specifically responsive to different wavelengths allows spatiotemporal control of gene expression in a so far unprecedented manner.In this chapter, we first describe the available light-inducible gene expression systems compatible with mammalian cells and explain their underlying mechanisms. Afterward, we give a detailed protocol for the implementation of a UVB light-inducible expression system in mammalian cells.", "doi": "10.1007/978-1-4939-7223-4_13", "title": "Light-Responsive Promoters.", "journal": ["Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)", "Methods Mol.
