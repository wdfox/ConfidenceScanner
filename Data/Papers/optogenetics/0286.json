Optogenetic activation of CCKNTS axon terminals within either the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) or the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH) is sufficient to suppress feeding. An interesting dichotomy has been revealed when assessing the motivational valence of these two circuits. Activating CCKNTS cell bodies is aversive as demonstrated by conditioned taste aversion and place-preference assays. Activation of the CCKNTS\u2192PBN pathway is also aversive; however, stimulating the CCKNTS\u2192PVH pathway is appetitive when assayed using a real-time, place-preference task. Thus, these two projections from CCKNTS neurons reduce food intake through opposite motivational states; one pathway signals positive valence (CCKNTS\u2192PVH) and the other signals negative valence (CCKNTS\u2192PBN).", "doi": "10.1016/j.neuroscience.2017.06.049", "title": "A tale of two circuits: CCKNTS neuron stimulation controls appetite and induces opposing motivational states by projections to distinct brain regions.", "journal": ["Neuroscience", "Neuroscience"]}
