This technique has also been combined with pharmacology and optogenetics as well as morphological reconstruction to address critical questions concerning neuronal integration, plasticity, and connectivity. This protocol describes a technique for obtaining whole-cell recordings in awake head-fixed animals, allowing such questions to be investigated within the context of an intact network and natural behavioral states. First, animals are habituated to sit quietly with their heads fixed in place. Then, a whole-cell recording is obtained using an efficient, blind patching protocol. We have successfully applied this technique to rats and mice.", "doi": "10.1101/pdb.prot095802", "title": "In Vivo Patch-Clamp Recording in Awake Head-Fixed Rodents.", "journal": ["Cold Spring Harbor protocols", "Cold Spring Harb Protoc"]}
