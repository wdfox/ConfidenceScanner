Photostimulation of the seizure-sensitive mutant parabss1 causes behavioral paralysis that resembles paralysis caused by mechanical stimulation, in many aspects. Electrophysiology shows that photostimulation evokes abnormal seizure-like neuronal firing in parabss1 followed by a quiescent period resembling synaptic failure and apparently responsible for paralysis. The pattern of neuronal activity concludes with seizure-like activity just prior to recovery. We tentatively identify the mushroom body as one apparent locus of optogenetic seizure initiation. The \u03b1/\u03b2 lobes may be primarily responsible for mushroom body seizure induction.", "doi": "10.1534/genetics.116.194779", "title": "Investigation of Seizure-Susceptibility in a Drosophila melanogaster Model of Human Epilepsy with Optogenetic Stimulation.", "journal": ["Genetics", "Genetics"]}
