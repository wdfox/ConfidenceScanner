Recent advances in stem cell biology have enabled the derivation of patient-specific human neuronal cells of various subtypes for the study of neuronal function and disease pathology. Nevertheless, one persistent challenge using these human-derived neurons is the ability to reconstruct models of human brain circuitry. To overcome this obstacle, we have developed a compartmentalized microfluidic device, which allows for spatial separation of cell bodies of different human-derived neuronal subtypes (excitatory, inhibitory and dopaminergic) but is permissive to the spreading of projecting processes. Induced neurons (iNs) cultured in the device expressed pan-neuronal markers and subtype specific markers. Morphologically, we demonstrate defined synaptic contacts between selected neuronal subtypes by synapsin staining. Functionally, we show that excitatory neuronal stimulation evoked excitatory postsynaptic current responses in the neurons cultured in a separate chamber.", "doi": "10.1142/S2339547817500054", "title": "\u03bcNeurocircuitry: Establishing in vitro models of neurocircuits with human neurons.", "journal": ["Technology", "Technology (Singap World Sci)"]}
