In this review we summarize the history of automated behavioral analysis in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We highlight recent studies of learning and memory to exemplify just how complex the genetic and neural circuit mechanisms underlying a seemingly simple single behavioral response can be. We finish by looking forward at the exciting prospects of combing genomic technologies with connectomic and phenomic level measurements.", "doi": "10.1111/gbb.12437", "title": "Beyond the response-High throughput behavioral analyses to link genome to phenome in Caenorhabditis elegans.", "journal": ["Genes, brain, and behavior", "Genes Brain Behav."]}
