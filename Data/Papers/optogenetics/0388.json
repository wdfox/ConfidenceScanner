This provides advantages over traditional end-to-end fibers, especially in applications requiring fiber bundles such as brain stimulation or remote sensing. This Letter demonstrates that continuous wave (CW) laser micro-ablation can controllably create conical-shaped cavities, or side windows, for outputting light. The dimensions of these cavities determine the amount of firing light and their firing angle. Experimental data show that a single side window on a 730 \u03bcm fiber can deliver more than 8% of the input light. This can be increased to more than 19% on a 65 \u03bcm fiber with side windows created using femtosecond laser ablation and chemical etching. Fine control of light distribution along an optical fiber is critical for various biomedical applications such as light-activated drug-release and optogenetics studies.", "doi": null, "title": "Fabrication of multipoint side-firing optical fiber by laser micro-ablation.", "journal": ["Optics letters", "Opt Lett"]}
