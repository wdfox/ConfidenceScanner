Hence, in this work, we present an 8100 pixel high radiance photonic stimulator. The chip module vertically combines custom made gallium nitride \u03bc LEDs with a CMOS application specific integrated circuit. This is designed with active pixels to ensure random access and to allow continuous illumination of all required pixels. The \u03bcLEDs have been assembled on the chip using a solder ball flip-chip bonding technique which has allowed for reliable and repeatable manufacture. We have evaluated the performance of the matrix by measuring the different factors including the static, dynamic power consumption, the illumination, and the current consumption by each LED. We show that the power consumption is within a range suitable for portable use. Finally, the thermal behavior of the matrix is monitored and the matrix proved to be thermally stable.", "doi": "10.1109/TBCAS.2016.2623949", "title": "High Density, High Radiance $\\mu$ LED Matrix for Optogenetic Retinal Prostheses and Planar Neural Stimulation.", "journal": ["IEEE transactions on biomedical circuits and systems", "IEEE Trans Biomed Circuits Syst"]}
