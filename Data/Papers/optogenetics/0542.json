At cellular levels, adrenergic signaling increases dendrite excitability, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here we show that activation of \u03b22-adrenoceptors promoted STD long-term synaptic potentiation at mouse hippocampal excitatory synapses by inactivating dendritic Kv1.1-containing\u00a0potassium channels, which increased dendrite excitability and facilitated dendritic propagation of postsynaptic depolarization, potentially improving coincidental activation of pre- and postsynaptic terminals. We further demonstrate that adrenergic modulation of Kv1.1 was mediated by the signaling scaffold SAP97, which, through direct protein-protein interactions, escorts \u03b22 signaling to remove Kv1.1 from the dendrite surface. These results reveal a mechanism through which the postsynaptic signaling scaffolds bridge the aroused brain state to promote induction of synaptic plasticity and\u00a0potentially to enhance spike timing and memory encoding.", "doi": "10.1016/j.neuron.2016.12.039", "title": "Adrenergic Gate Release for Spike Timing-Dependent Synaptic Potentiation.", "journal": ["Neuron", "Neuron"]}
