Here we demonstrate that optogenetic activation of dopamine D1 receptor-expressing MSNs terminals in the substantia nigra pars reticulata resulted in sustained and chronic repetitive behaviors. These data show for the first time that activation of the striatonigral direct pathway is sufficient to generate motor stereotypies.", "doi": "10.1016/j.neures.2017.09.007", "title": "Striatonigral direct pathway activation is sufficient to induce repetitive behaviors.", "journal": ["Neuroscience research", "Neurosci.
