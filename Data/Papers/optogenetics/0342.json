Here, we demonstrate the inclusion of additional N- and C-terminal protein domains in an RNA editing-dependent manner to switch between protein isoforms in mammalian cell culture. By inclusion of localization signals, a switch of the subcellular protein localization was achieved. This included the shift from the cytoplasm to the outer-membrane, which typically is inaccessible at the protein-level. Furthermore, the strategy allows to implement photocaging to achieve spatiotemporal control of isoform switching. The strategy does not require substantial genetic engineering, and might well complement current optogenetic and optochemical approaches.", "doi": "10.1021/acssynbio.7b00113", "title": "Switching Protein Localization by Site-Directed RNA Editing under Control of Light.", "journal": ["ACS synthetic biology", "ACS Synth Biol"]}
