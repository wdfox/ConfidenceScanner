The modern optogenetic toolbox includes fluorescent sensors\u00a0to visualize signaling events in living cells and optogenetic actuators enabling manipulation of\u00a0numerous cellular activities. Most optogenetic tools are not targeted to specific subcellular compartments but are localized with limited discrimination throughout the cell. Therefore, optogenetic activation often does not reflect context-dependent effects of highly localized intracellular signaling events. Subcellular targeting is required to achieve more specific optogenetic readouts and photomanipulation. Here we first provide a detailed overview of the available optogenetic tools with a focus on\u00a0optogenetic actuators. Second, we review established strategies for targeting these tools to specific subcellular compartments. Finally, we discuss useful tools and targeting strategies that are currently missing from the optogenetics repertoire and provide suggestions for novel subcellular optogenetic applications.", "doi": "10.1016/j.neuron.2017.09.047", "title": "Optogenetic Tools for Subcellular Applications in Neuroscience.", "journal": ["Neuron", "Neuron"]}
