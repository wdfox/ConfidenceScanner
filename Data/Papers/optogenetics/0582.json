This, together with their place in the public consciousness, makes the overview provided by this review particularly helpful to practicing neurologists.", "doi": "10.1097/WCO.0000000000000412", "title": "Artificial vision: principles and prospects.", "journal": ["Current opinion in neurology", "Curr.
