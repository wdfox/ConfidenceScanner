Here we developed a high-throughput-compatible fluorescent-based cellular assay that combines optogenetics and co-culture approaches to obtain spatial, temporal, and quantitative control of ion channel activity. The modularity and increased flexibility of control of this light-tandem assay, combined with contained costs and compatibility with conventional drug-screening platforms, make this system suitable for temporally precise screening of ion channel function in controlled conformations and can also be used to recapitulate other complexly regulated biological processes.", "doi": "10.1177/2472555217722990", "title": "Three-Dimensional Control of Ion Channel Function through Optogenetics and Co-Culture.", "journal": ["SLAS discovery : advancing life sciences R & D", "SLAS Discov"]}
