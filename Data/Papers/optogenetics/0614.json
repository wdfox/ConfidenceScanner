With individual fibers in the bundle being only a few microns in diameter, single neurons are readily resolved in brain images transmitted by the fiber bundle. The third dimension is added by scanning the fiber in the longitudinal direction, with the fluorescence return read out from only one of the fibers in the bundle.", "doi": "10.1002/jbio.201600002", "title": "Three-dimensional fiber-optic readout of single-neuron-resolved fluorescence in living brain of transgenic mice.", "journal": ["Journal of biophotonics", "J Biophotonics"]}
