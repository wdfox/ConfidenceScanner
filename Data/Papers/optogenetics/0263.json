We addressed this issue in the Drosophila mushroom body (MB), a higher olfactory circuit, where neurons belonging to distinct glomeruli in the antennal lobe feed excitation to three types of\u00a0intrinsic neurons, \u03b1/\u03b2, \u03b1'/\u03b2', and \u03b3 Kenyon cells (KCs). Two-photon optogenetics and intracellular recording revealed that whereas glomerular inputs add similarly in all KCs, spikes were generated most readily in \u03b1'/\u03b2' KCs. This cell type was also the most competent in recruiting GABAergic inhibition fed back by anterior paired lateral neuron, which responded to odors either locally within a lobe or globally across all lobes depending on the strength of stimuli. Notably, as predicted from these physiological properties, \u03b1'/\u03b2' KCs had the highest odor detection speed, sensitivity, and discriminability. This enhanced discrimination required proper GABAergic inhibition. These results link cell-type-specific mechanisms and functions in the MB circuit.", "doi": "10.1016/j.neuron.2017.06.039", "title": "Origins of Cell-Type-Specific Olfactory Processing in the Drosophila Mushroom Body Circuit.", "journal": ["Neuron", "Neuron"]}
