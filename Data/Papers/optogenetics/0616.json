In this study, we used optogenetic tools to investigate the impact of striatal neuronal activity on the neurogenesis and functional recovery after cerebral ischemia. We transfected striatal neurons with channelrhodopsin-2 or halorhodopsin from Natronomonas so that they can be excited by 473\u2009nm laser or inhibited by 594\u2009nm laser, respectively. Neural inhibition but not excitation at 4-7 days after middle cerebral artery occlusion resulted in reduced atrophy volume (6.8\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7 vs 8.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.2\u2009mm3, p\u2009<\u20090.05) and better performance represented by longer sustaining time on rotarod (99.3\u2009\u00b1\u20099 vs 80.1\u2009\u00b1\u200911\u2009s, p\u2009<\u20090.01) and faster moving speed (7.7\u2009\u00b1\u20092 vs 5.7\u2009\u00b1\u20091.1\u2009cm/s, p\u2009<\u20090.05) in open field tests. Furthermore, neural inhibition increased the number of nestin+, BrdU+/doublecortin+ and BrdU+/NeuN+ cells ( p\u2009<\u20090.001) in the subventricular zone and peri-focal region, and the expression level of axon guidance factor Netrin-1 (0.39\u2009\u00b1\u20090.16 vs 0.16\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02, p\u2009<\u20090.05) in the peri-focal region. These data suggest that striatal neuronal activity plays an important role in regulating neurogenesis and neural-behavioral outcomes, and that inhibiting striatal neurons by optogenetics promotes the recovery after ischemic stroke in mice.", "doi": "10.1177/0271678X16642242", "title": "Optical inhibition of striatal neurons promotes focal neurogenesis and neurobehavioral recovery in mice after middle cerebral artery occlusion.", "journal": ["Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism", "J.
