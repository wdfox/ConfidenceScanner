Here, we characterized the effects of optogenetic inhibition and activation of PV interneurons on spontaneous and sensory-evoked activity in mouse barrel cortex in vivo. Inhibiting PV interneurons led to a broad-spectrum power increase both in spontaneous and sensory-evoked activity. Whisker-evoked responses were significantly increased within 20 ms after stimulus onset during inhibition of PV interneurons, demonstrating high temporal precision of PV-shaped inhibition. Multiunit activity was strongly enhanced in neighboring cortical columns, but not at the site of transduction, supporting a central and highly specific role of PV interneurons in lateral inhibition. Inversely, activating PV interneurons drastically decreased spontaneous and whisker-evoked activity in the principal column and exerted strong lateral inhibition. Histological assessment of transduced cells combined with quantitative modeling of light distribution and spike sorting revealed that only a minor fraction (~10%) of the local PV population comprising no more than a few hundred neurons is optogenetically modulated, mediating the observed prominent and widespread effects on neocortical processing.", "doi": "10.1093/cercor/bhx261", "title": "Optogenetic Modulation of a Minor Fraction of Parvalbumin-Positive Interneurons Specifically Affects Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Spontaneous and Sensory-Evoked Activity in Mouse Somatosensory Cortex in Vivo.", "journal": ["Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)", "Cereb.
