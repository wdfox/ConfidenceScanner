Changes in total spectral power, band-limited spectral power, and spike rate were assessed.121 patients participating in trials of the RNS\u00ae System had a total of 93994 ECoG records analyzed. Significant changes in total spectral power occurred from the first to second months after implantation, involving 55% of all ECoG channels (68% of strip and 47% of depth lead channels). Significant, but less pronounced, changes continued over the 2nd to 5th post-implant months, after which total power became more stable. Similar patterns of changes were observed within frequency bands and spike rate.ECoG spectral power and spike rates are not stable in the first 5\u202fmonths after implantation, presumably due to neurophysiological and electrode-tissue interface changes.ECoG data collected in the first 5\u202fmonths after implantation of intracranial electrodes may not be fully representative of chronic cortical electrophysiology.", "doi": "10.1016/j.clinph.2017.10.036", "title": "Changes in the electrocorticogram after implantation of intracranial electrodes in humans: The implant effect.", "journal": ["Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "Clin Neurophysiol"]}
