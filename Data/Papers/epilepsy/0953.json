Optimization focused mainly on solubility, brain penetration, and the search for an aminopyrazole metabolite that would be negative in an Ames test. This resulted in the preparation and complete characterization of compound 66b (ACT-709478), which has been selected as a clinical candidate.", "doi": "10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01236", "title": "Discovery of a Potent, Selective T-type Calcium Channel Blocker as a Drug Candidate for the Treatment of Generalized Epilepsies.", "journal": ["Journal of medicinal chemistry", "J.
