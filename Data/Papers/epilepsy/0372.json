MEG epileptiform discharges were divided into three sub-groups based on the duration viz., 1s (very short),>1-9.9s (short) and \u226510s (long) and the discharges of each group were averaged independently in each patient. MEG source analysis was performed on these averaged discharges, of each of the subgroups, at the onset, during middle and offset.The source locations obtained, in lobar and gyri levels, were compared across these three groups of varying duration of discharges and in the CAE and JAE subjects. It was observed that the most frequent location of sources from the sublobar, limbic and frontal lobes in all the discharge groups at different time intervals. Also, it was noted that there were only subtle and variable degree of the differences of source localization of epileptic discharges among CAE and JAE subgroups.The study provided novel findings regarding origin and propagation of sources of epileptiform discharges in patients with childhood and juvenile absence epilepsies. Such analysis further improves the understanding of network involvement of subcortical and cortical regions in these patients.", "doi": "10.1016/j.eplepsyres.2017.12.003", "title": "Source analysis of epileptiform discharges in absence epilepsy using Magnetoencephalography (MEG).", "journal": ["Epilepsy research", "Epilepsy Res."]}
