Thus, any agent(s) that mitigate(s) these events in hippocampus might attenuate seizure severity. The effects of asiatic acid (AA) or maslinic acid (MA) pre-administration at 20 or 40mg/kg body weight/day upon inflammatory, oxidative and apoptotic injury in hippocampus of kainic acid (KA)-treated mice were examined. KA induced seizure-like behavioral patterns, which was attenuated by AA or MA pre-administration. KA stimulated the release of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and prostaglandin E2 in hippocampus of mice. AA or MA pre-administration decreased the production of these inflammatory factors. AA or MA also diminished KA-induced increase in hippocampal cyclooxygenase-2 activity and relative NF-\u03baB p50/65 binding activity. KA depleted glutathione content and promoted reactive oxygen species generation. AA or MA pre-administration reversed these alterations. KA lowered Bcl-2 mRNA expression and increased Bax mRNA expression. AA or MA treatments reduced Bax mRNA expression. AA or MA pre-administration enhanced glutamine synthetase activity, decreased glutamate level and increased glutamine level in hippocampus of KA treated mice. In addition, AA or MA pre-treatments at 10 and 20\u03bcM increased viability and decreased plasma membrane damage in KA treated nerve growth factor (NGF)-differentiated PC12 cells. Both agents also lowered the release of calcium ion induced by KA in NGF-treated PC12 cells. These findings support that asiatic acid and maslinic acid are potent nutraceutical agents for seizure alleviation.", "doi": "10.1016/j.eplepsyres.2017.11.003", "title": "Asiatic acid and maslinic acid attenuated kainic acid-induced seizure through decreasing hippocampal inflammatory and oxidative stress.", "journal": ["Epilepsy research", "Epilepsy Res."]}
