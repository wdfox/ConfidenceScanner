The inclusion criteria consisted of having been diagnosed with JIE by ruling out other causes of seizures in foals and supported by electroencephalographic examination.Ten Egyptian Arabian horses (5 females and 5 males) were phenotyped as foals with JIE by electroencephalography (EEG). All foals were negative for the genetic mutations that cause LFS, CA, SCID, and OAAM1 except for 1 foal that was a carrier of CA.Juvenile idiopathic epilepsy of Egyptian Arabian foals and LFS appear to be phenotypically and genetically distinct disorders.
