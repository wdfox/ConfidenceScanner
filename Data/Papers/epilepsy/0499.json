Following the end of stimulation, autonomous seizures continued for >5 minutes in 85% of the animals. There was ongoing 2-3-Hz rhythmic, high-amplitude, slow spike-wave discharges (HASDs) associated with purposeless, repetitive, continuously circling and exploratory behavior. There were high-amplitude fast discharges (HAFDs) associated with worsening of behavioral seizures that were interspersed with the ongoing HASDs. Death during SE occurred in 23% of the animals, and it was preceded by a stage 5 behavioral seizure. In the waning stage of SE, severe seizures and HAFDs dissipated, HASDs slowed down, and normal behavior was restored in most animals. Epilepsy developed in 33% of the animals monitored after SE.The electrical stimulation model of SE can be used to study mechanisms of SE and its adverse consequences, including death and epileptogenesis.", "doi": "10.1111/epi.13972", "title": "Electroencephalography and behavior patterns during experimental status epilepticus.", "journal": ["Epilepsia", "Epilepsia"]}
