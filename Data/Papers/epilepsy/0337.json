Previously, MVNTs were probably tumors incidentally determined by imaging methods, but they could not be diagnosed or they were misdiagnosed. Two cases are reported in the present study, for which radiological imaging was carried out for epilepsy in one and for headache in the other. The first case was a twenty seven years old female patient with headache complaint. Brain MRI examination revealed a clustering lesion of multinodular character located in an about 4.0 \u00d7 3.5 \u00d7 1.5 cm area which had a left precuneal\u00a0subcortical-juxtacortical location. The other case was a male patient with epilepsy. A clustering lesion of multinodular nature was determined in an area of about 2.0 \u00d7 2.0 \u00d7 1.5 cm in cortical-subcortical area in corona radiata-convexity plane of right middle frontal girus. No changes in size or nature were determined in follow-up examinations. MVNTs are recently defined tumors, and the characteristic feature for diagnosis of these rare tumor entities could be a subcortical white matter lesion with satellite nodules that manifest itself as T2/FLAIRhyperintensity. Increasing number of case reports and studies in the literature could make the radiological and pathological signs of the condition clearer.", "doi": "10.1007/s13760-017-0872-x", "title": "Magnetic resonance imaging findings of two cases with multinodular and vacuolating neuronal tumor.", "journal": ["Acta neurologica Belgica", "Acta Neurol Belg"]}
