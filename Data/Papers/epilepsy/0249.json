These enzymes are involved in a variety of diseases, including glaucoma, retinitis pigmentosa, epilepsy, arthritis, and tumors. The investigated compounds showed potent inhibitory action against hCA II, VII, and IX, in the low nanomolar range, thus making them of interest for the development of isoform-selective inhibitors and as candidates for biomedical applications.", "doi": "10.1021/acsmedchemlett.7b00387", "title": "Synthesis of Novel Selenides Bearing Benzenesulfonamide Moieties as Carbonic Anhydrase I, II, IV, VII, and IX Inhibitors.", "journal": ["ACS medicinal chemistry letters", "ACS Med Chem Lett"]}
