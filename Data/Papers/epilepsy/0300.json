Animal models have increased our understanding about the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the association between seizures and these comorbidities. This article starts with an overview of the current data on animal model research, studying the influence of early-life seizures, followed by a summary of potential cellular and molecular mechanisms by which seizures can affect cognitive development. We then describe specific abnormal neuropsychological profiles that accompany specific pediatric epilepsy syndromes. Finally, we offer a potential guideline to the treatment and management of children with epilepsy and its neurocognitive comorbidities.", "doi": "10.1016/j.spen.2017.10.002", "title": "Neurocognitive Comorbidities in Pediatric Epilepsy: Lessons in the Laboratory and Clinical Profile.", "journal": ["Seminars in pediatric neurology", "Semin Pediatr Neurol"]}
