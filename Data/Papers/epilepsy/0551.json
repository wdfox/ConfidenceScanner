The goal of this work was to quantify topographic changes occurring during NREM sleep in comparison with wakefulness.We studied intracerebral recordings of 20 patients who underwent stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) during presurgical evaluation for pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy. We measured the number of interictal spikes (IS) and quantified the co-occurrence of IS between brain regions during 1\u00a0hour of NREM sleep and 1\u00a0hour of wakefulness. Co-occurrence is a method to estimate IS networks based on a temporal concordance between IS of different brain regions. Each studied region was labeled as \"seizure-onset zone\" (SOZ), \"propagation zone\" (PZ), or \"not involved region\" (NIR).During NREM sleep, the number of interictal spikes significantly increased in all regions (mean of 68%). This increase was higher in medial temporal regions than in other regions, whether involved in the SOZ. Spike co-occurrence increased significantly in all regions during NREM sleep in comparison with wakefulness but was greater in neocortical regions. Spike co-occurrence in medial temporal regions was not higher than in other regions, suggesting that the increase of the number of spikes in this region was in great part a local effect.This study demonstrated that medial temporal regions show a greater propensity to spike production or propagation during NREM sleep compared to other brain regions, even when the medial temporal lobe is not involved in the SOZ.", "doi": "10.1111/epi.13958", "title": "Brain regions and epileptogenicity influence epileptic interictal spike production and propagation during NREM sleep in comparison with wakefulness.", "journal": ["Epilepsia", "Epilepsia"]}
