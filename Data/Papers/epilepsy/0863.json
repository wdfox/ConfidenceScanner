For benefit outcomes, we have shown how risk assessments using the Outcome Reporting Bias in Trials risk classification scale can be used to calculate bias-adjusted treatment effect estimates. This paper presents a new and simpler version of the benefits method, and shows how it can be extended to cover the partial reporting and non-reporting of harm outcomes. Our motivating example is a Cochrane systematic review of 12 studies of Topiramate add-on therapy for drug-resistant partial epilepsy. Bias adjustments for partially reported or unreported outcomes suggest that the review has overestimated the benefits and underestimated the harms of the test treatment.", "doi": "10.1177/0962280217738546", "title": "Model-based sensitivity analysis for outcome reporting bias in the meta analysis of benefit and harm outcomes.", "journal": ["Statistical methods in medical research", "Stat Methods Med Res"]}
