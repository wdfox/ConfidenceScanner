Epilepsies can be genetic or acquired, and the underlying mechanisms of seizure initiation, seizure propagation, and comorbid conditions are incompletely understood. Metabolic changes including the production of reactive species are known to result from prolonged seizures and may also contribute to epilepsy development. In this review, we focus on the evidence that metabolic and redox disruption is both cause and consequence of epileptic seizures. Additionally, we discuss the promise of targeting redox processes as a therapeutic option in epilepsy.", "doi": "10.3390/ijms18112365", "title": "Metabolic Dysfunction and Oxidative Stress in Epilepsy.", "journal": ["International journal of molecular sciences", "Int J Mol Sci"]}
