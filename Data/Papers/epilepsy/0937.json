We evaluated the significance of the genetic findings by reanalyzing sequence data generated at Ambry Genetics, and from a number of additional case and control cohorts.ResultsIn 54 previously undiagnosed trios, we identified two de novo missense variants in SCN8A in the highly expressed alternative exon 5\u2009A-an exon only recently added to the Consensus Coding Sequence database. One additional undiagnosed epilepsy patient harboring a de novo variant in exon 5\u2009A was found in the Ambry Genetics cohort. Missense variants in SCN8A exon 5\u2009A are extremely rare in the population, further supporting the pathogenicity of the de novo alterations identified.ConclusionThese results expand the range of SCN8A variants in epileptic encephalopathy patients and illustrate the necessity of ongoing reanalysis of negative exome sequences, as advances in the knowledge of disease genes and their annotations will permit new diagnoses to be made.GENETICS in MEDICINE advance online publication, 2 October 2017; doi:10.1038/gim.2017.100.", "doi": "10.1038/gim.2017.100", "title": "De novo variants in the alternative exon 5 of SCN8A cause epileptic encephalopathy.", "journal": ["Genetics in medicine : official journal of the American College of Medical Genetics", "Genet.
