Age at the initiation of the diet therapy ranged from 3 to 244\u202fmonths (median, 32.5\u202fmonths). Thirty-four patients were fed via tube, and the remaining 8 were fed orally. About 93% of patients were able to continue the diet for 1\u202fmonth, 74% for 3\u202fmonths, and 64% for 6\u202fmonths. The median period of continuation was 16\u202fmonths. One patient was able to continue as long as 7\u202fyears. The ketogenic ratio was maintained at about 3.0. The seizure-free rate and responder (>50% seizure reduction) rate were about 10% and 30-40%, respectively during the 12\u202fmonths on the diet. Mean serum beta-hydroxybutyrate increased to almost 4\u202fmM at 1\u202fmonth and was maintained during the diet period. Side effects, which required discontinuation of the diet therapy, occurred in 11 of 42 patients and included hypertonia, weight loss, vomiting, hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and hypokalemia.M817-B could be used long-term with demonstrated efficacy in seizure reduction, although there are some side effects that may require cessation of the diet therapy.", "doi": "10.1016/j.braindev.2017.11.003", "title": "Ketogenic diet using a Japanese ketogenic milk for patients with epilepsy: A multi-institutional study.", "journal": ["Brain & development", "Brain Dev."]}
