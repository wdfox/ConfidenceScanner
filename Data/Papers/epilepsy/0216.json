Nowadays, this technology is widely used for movement disorders and is undergoing multiple clinical and basic science research for development of new applications. Epilepsy is one of the conditions that can benefit from these emerging technologies. The objective of this manuscript is to review literature about historical background, current principles and outcomes of available modalities of neuromodulation and deep brain stimulation in epilepsy patients.", "doi": "10.3390/brainsci8010002", "title": "Stimulation and Neuromodulation in the Treatment of Epilepsy.", "journal": ["Brain sciences", "Brain Sci"]}
