It affects around 20%-30% of those with epilepsy, migraine, and MS, and evidence for a bidirectional association exists for each of these conditions. Depression screening tools generally perform well in neurologic conditions, but are not without limitations.Depression is a major contributor to poor outcomes in epilepsy, migraine, and MS. Although psychiatric resources are scarce globally, this is no reason to ignore depression in neurologic conditions. Depression screening tools are available in neurology and should be considered in clinical practice.", "doi": "10.1212/CPJ.0000000000000349", "title": "Depression in epilepsy, migraine, and multiple sclerosis: Epidemiology and how to screen for it.", "journal": ["Neurology.
