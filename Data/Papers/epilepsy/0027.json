Data on 49 consecutive patients with severe DRE who initiated PER were retrospectively collected. Twelve of the 49 patients experienced aggressiveness as adverse event related to PER treatment, one third of them on low (2-4 mg/day) PER dosages. PER was discontinued in 10/12 patients because of aggressive behaviors. Aggressiveness could appear after several months or even more than one year of PER treatment. One third of patients with PER-related aggressiveness had intellectual disabilities and 5/12 patients took levetiracetam as a concomitant antiepileptic drug. Our study suggests that the occurrence of aggressive behaviors in patients with severe DRE is not uncommon during PER treatment and that it may occur after months or even years of treatment with a stable dosage, requiring PER discontinuation in the great majority of patients.", "doi": null, "title": "Add-on perampanel and aggressive behaviour in severe drug-resistant focal epilepsies.", "journal": ["Functional neurology", "Funct.
