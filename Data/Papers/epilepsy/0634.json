Biopsy-proven cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosed via clinical and imaging studies (but without biopsy confirmation) have been previously reported. We report, herein, a case of a 53-year-old woman with arginase 1 deficiency who developed symptoms of \"abdominal bloating.\" Imaging studies (ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging) demonstrated 2 dominant hepatic masses, measuring 5.9\u2009cm and 5.7\u2009cm in greatest dimensions and located in hepatic segments 5 and 6, respectively. Core biopsies of the lesions demonstrated well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma. Immunohistochemistry performed on the segment 5 lesion was negative for arginase 1. This report represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first case of biopsy-proven hepatocellular carcinoma in an individual with arginase 1 deficiency.", "doi": "10.1177/1093526617697058", "title": "Biopsy-proven Hepatocellular Carcinoma in a 53-year-old Woman With Arginase Deficiency.", "journal": ["Pediatric and developmental pathology : the official journal of the Society for Pediatric Pathology and the Paediatric Pathology Society", "Pediatr.
