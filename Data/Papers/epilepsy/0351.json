Police had noticed him driving erratically through his village. He did not stop when instructed, drove slowly home and appeared 'vacant' on questioning. While in hospital, he had approximately 15 episodes of catatonia, involving rigidity, negativism, mutism except echolalia and perseveration, automatic obedience and utilisation phenomena, lasting 2-20\u2009min each. Between episodes, he was amnestic but otherwise well. Electroencephalography demonstrated bifrontal slowing with left-sided emphasis, and captured two focal onset partial seizures with the clinical correlate of the syndrome described above. He improved rapidly on levetiracetam and lorazepam, was discharged and received a diagnosis of dementia by his community mental health team shortly afterwards, based on chronic short-term memory loss, functional decline and MRI changes. This case has implications for our understanding of the neural correlate of catatonia, specifically frontal lobe pathway dysfunction.", "doi": "10.1136/bcr-2017-222444", "title": "Intermittent catatonia and complex automatisms caused by frontal lobe epilepsy in dementia.", "journal": ["BMJ case reports", "BMJ Case Rep"]}
