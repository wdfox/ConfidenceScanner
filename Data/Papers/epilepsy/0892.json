Pediatric patients with MMD who had seizures before revascularization were identified. We summarized the characteristics of seizures in pediatric patients with MMD and analyzed the predictive factors of recurrent seizure events.We identified 28 pediatric patients with MMD who had seizures before revascularization. During follow-up (median 42 months), 7 patients (25.0%) experienced recurrent seizures. In the multivariate analysis, the duration of epilepsy was an independent predictor for postoperative seizure recurrences (odds ratio 3.84, 95% confidence interval 1.54-24.34; P\u2009=\u2009.035). The 2 common surgical modalities of MMD (direct and indirect bypass) had no significant difference in future seizure prevention in pediatric patients with MMD with epilepsy.We identified the duration of epilepsy as an independent risk factor for recurrent seizure after revascularization in pediatric patients with MMD.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2017.10.012", "title": "Risk Factors for Epilepsy Recurrence after Revascularization in Pediatric Patients with Moyamoya Disease.", "journal": ["Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association", "J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis"]}
