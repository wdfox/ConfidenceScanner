Development of novel AEDs therefore remains a high priority. Perampanel is a first-in-class non-competitive selective AMPA receptor antagonist with a unique mechanism of action. Clinical efficacy and safety of perampanel as adjunctive treatment for focal seizures with/without secondary generalization (\u00b1SG) and primary generalized tonic-clonic (PGTC) seizures have been established in five phase 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and a long-term extension study, and perampanel is approved as monotherapy for focal seizures \u00b1SG in the USA. In patients with focal seizures \u00b1SG, add-on perampanel resulted in median percent reduction in seizure frequency 23.3%-34.5% and \u226550% responder rate 28.5%-37.6%; in PGTC seizures, these results were 76.5% and 64.2%, respectively. Efficacy among adolescents (reduction in seizure frequency 34.8%-35.6%; \u226550% responder rate 40.9%-45.0%) and elderly people (reduction in seizure frequency 12.5%-16.9%; \u226550% responder rate 22.2%-42.9%) is similar to those in adults, and results remain comparable between Asian (reduction in seizure frequency 17.3%-38.0%) and global populations. Perampanel has been extensively studied in real-world clinical practice, with similar efficacy and safety results to the RCTs (\u226550% responder rate 12.8%-75.0%; adverse events of somnolence/sedation, dizziness, ataxia, and behavioral changes). Real-world observational studies suggest that perampanel tolerability can be improved by slow titration (2\u00a0mg every 2-4\u00a0weeks), and bedtime administration can mitigate somnolence and dizziness. Counseling about the potential for behavioral changes and close monitoring are recommended.", "doi": "10.1111/ane.12879", "title": "Perampanel, an AMPA receptor antagonist: From clinical research to practice in clinical settings.", "journal": ["Acta neurologica Scandinavica", "Acta Neurol.
