Many epileptic patients are not completely treated with currently available marketed drugs as well as so many drugs have shown unfavorable side effect and drug interaction. Therefore, there are continuing interests to find new anticonvulsant drugs. Recently, there has been wide interest in compounds containing the isatin moiety with diverse biological effects. In view of the previous continuation of an ongoing program aiming at finding new structure leads to potential anticonvulsant activities, we are trying to compile recent efforts which have been made in the design and development of isatin derived anticonvulsant agents.", "doi": "10.2174/1871524917666171113124112", "title": "ISATIN: New hope against convulsion.", "journal": ["Central nervous system agents in medicinal chemistry", "Cent Nerv Syst Agents Med Chem"]}
