Kaufman oculocerebrofacial syndrome represents a rare and recently reevaluated entity within the BMR syndromes and is caused by biallelic mutations of UBE3B. Affected individuals typically show microcephaly, impaired somatic growth, gastrointestinal and genitourinary problems, ectodermal anomalies and a characteristic face with short, upslanted palpebral fissures, depressed nasal bridge. and anteverted nares. Here we present four patients with five novel UBE3B mutations and propose the inclusion of clinical features to the characteristics of Kaufman oculocerebrofacial syndrome, including prominence of the cheeks and limb anomalies.", "doi": "10.1002/ajmg.a.38538", "title": "Kaufman oculocerebrofacial syndrome: Novel UBE3B mutations and clinical features in four unrelated patients.", "journal": ["American journal of medical genetics.
