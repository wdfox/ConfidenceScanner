Since 80% of patients are under 20 years of age, it is mainly a disease of the developmental period. The causes of epilepsy are heterogeneous, but the disease has always been considered a genetic disorder, which no longer doubted. Epilepsy genetics has undergone a revolution since the discovery of the first gene responsible for epilepsy. This is mainly because of introduction of the next generation sequencing as research and diagnostic tool, and transition from studies of pedigrees with epilepsy to the analysis of cases of epileptic encephalopathies. In a short time more than 50 early infantile epileptic encephalopathies were recognized due to the causative genes. Whole exome or targeted panel sequencing has been used as a diagnostic tool with a diagnostic yield of about 30-40%. The \"genetic diagnosis\" that is obtained makes it possible to introduce targeted treatment in an increasing number of cases. Since epileptic encephalopaties are often regarded as the model disease for epilepsy, these therapeutic strategies can provide treatment for patients with common epilepsies.", "doi": null, "title": "[Trends and expectations the research on the molecular background of epileptic encephalopathies - state of the art in 2017].", "journal": ["Developmental period medicine", "Dev Period Med"]}
