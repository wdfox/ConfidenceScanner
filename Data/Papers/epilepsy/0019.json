Cutaneous side effects due to levetiracetam are rarely reported in the literature. In this article, we describe a patient with skin hyperpigmentation due to the treatment with levetiracetam with complete resolution after discontinuation of the medication. In addition, we review the topic and hypothesize the mechanism behind this rare complication. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of skin hyperpigmentation as a side effect of levetiracetam in the literature. The prescribing physicians should inform the patients about all potential side effect of levetiracetam including skin hyperpigmentation. Similar to many undiagnosed conditions, increased awareness of their existence is the key to diagnosis. Early recognition and timely cessation of therapy are important to reverse this effect. Further studies should be conducted to explore the pathophysiology of this rare side effect.", "doi": "10.14581/jer.17016", "title": "Levetiracetam-Induced Skin Hyperpigmentation: An Extremely Rare Undesirable Side Effect.", "journal": ["Journal of epilepsy research", "J Epilepsy Res"]}
