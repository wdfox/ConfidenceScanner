Patients with a p.Gly755Ser (p.G755S) mutation, one of minor genotypes for AHC, were recently described as having a mild phenotype, although their long-term outcomes are still unclear due to the lack of long-term follow up. Here, we demonstrate the full clinical course of a 43-year-old female AHC patient with p.G755S mutation. Although her motor dysfunction had been relatively mild into her 30\u202fs, she showed a subsequent severe aggravation of symptoms that left her bedridden, concomitant with a recent recurrence of seizure status. The seizures were refractory to anti-epileptic drugs, but administration of flunarizine improved seizures and the paralysis. Our case suggests that the phenotype of AHC with p.G755S mutation is not necessarily mild, despite such a presentation during the patient's younger years.", "doi": "10.1016/j.braindev.2017.11.007", "title": "Long-term follow up of an adult with alternating hemiplegia of childhood and a p.Gly755Ser mutation in the ATP1A3 gene.", "journal": ["Brain & development", "Brain Dev."]}
