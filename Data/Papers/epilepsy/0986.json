The resulting intracellular accumulation of GAGs leads to widespread tissue and organ dysfunction. In addition to somatic signs and symptoms, patients with MPS can present with neurological manifestations such as cognitive decline, behavioral problems (e.g. hyperactivity and aggressiveness), sleep disturbances, and/or epilepsy. These are associated with significant abnormalities of the central nervous system (CNS), including white and gray matter lesions, brain atrophy, ventriculomegaly, and spinal cord compression. In order to effectively manage and develop therapies for MPS that target neurological disease, it is important to visualize and quantify these CNS abnormalities. This review describes optimal approaches for conducting magnetic resonance imaging assessments in multi-center clinical studies, and summarizes current knowledge from neuroimaging studies in MPS disorders. The content of the review is based on presentations and discussions on these topics that were held during a meeting of an international group of experts.", "doi": "10.1016/j.ymgme.2017.09.006", "title": "Quantitative neuroimaging in mucopolysaccharidoses clinical trials.", "journal": ["Molecular genetics and metabolism", "Mol.
