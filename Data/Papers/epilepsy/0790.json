A search for articles with \"Mozart Effect,\" \"child*,\" and \"epilepsy\" was conducted in CINAHL Complete, Science Direct, Cochrane, and PubMed databases. Eight studies were selected based on the exclusion and inclusion criteria after removal of duplicates ( n = 17) and others ( n = 46). Studies included were English language, peer reviewed, published between April 2010 and February 2017, and available in full text with an abstract. Quasi-experimental studies demonstrate that the Mozart Effect May reduce epileptiform discharges or seizures in children and has potential as an adjunct to medical management of seizure activity or alone when medication or surgery is not accepted. A causal relationship between the music of Mozart and decreased seizure activity has yet to be demonstrated.", "doi": "10.1177/1059840517740940", "title": "Complementary and Alternative Medicine: The Mozart Effect on Childhood Epilepsy-A Systematic Review.", "journal": ["The Journal of school nursing : the official publication of the National Association of School Nurses", "J Sch Nurs"]}
