This method stand out compared to other proposed methods because of its algorithmic elegance and accuracy. A wavelet is a mathematical function based on time-frequency analysis in signal processing. It is useful particularly because it allows a weak signal to be recovered from a noisy signal without much distortion. A wavelet analysis works by analysing the image and converting it to mathematical function which is decoded by the receiver. Furthermore, we have used Shannon entropy and approximate entropy (ApEn) for extracting the complexities associated with electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. The ApEn is a suitable feature to characterise the EEGs because its value drops suddenly due to excessive synchronous discharge of neurons in the brain during epileptic activity in this study. EEG signals are decomposed into six EEG sub-bands namely D1-D5 and A5 using DWT technique. Non-linear features such as ApEn and Shannon entropy are calculated from these sub-bands and support vector machine classifiers are used for classification purpose. This scheme is tested using EEG data recorded from five healthy subjects and five epileptic patients during the inter-ictal and ictal periods. The data are acquired from University of Bonn, Germany. The proposed method is evaluated through 15 classification problems, and obtained high classification accuracy of 100% for two cases and it indicates the good classifying performance of the proposed method.", "doi": "10.1080/03091902.2017.1394389", "title": "Epileptic seizure detection using DWT-based approximate entropy, Shannon entropy and support vector machine: a case study.", "journal": ["Journal of medical engineering & technology", "J Med Eng Technol"]}
