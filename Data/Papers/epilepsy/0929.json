However, shunt complications are common and may require multiple surgical procedures during a patient's lifetime. We report the case of a 29-year-old patient with a background of Dandy-Walker malformation, occipital encephalocele, recurrent hydrocephalus, spina bifida and epilepsy presented with VP shunt migration into urinary and gastrointestinal tracts. In absence of sepsis or peritonism from either bowel or bladder perforation, local control of stent extrusion was successful for several years, although surgery was eventually undertaken.", "doi": "10.1136/bcr-2017-220187", "title": "Migration of ventriculoperitoneal shunt to urethral and rectal orifices.", "journal": ["BMJ case reports", "BMJ Case Rep"]}
