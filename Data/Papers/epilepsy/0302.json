Usually these morbidities cluster together in a single patient. Rather than these being separate conditions, all, including the seizures, are manifestations or coexpressions of developmental brain disorders. Instead of viewing epilepsy as the disease and the other features as comorbidities, approaching early-life epilepsies as part of the spectrum of developmental brain disorders could have implications for multidisciplinary care models, anticipatory guidance, and counseling of parents, as well as the design of randomized trials and targeting important outcomes. Ultimately, such an approach could improve understanding and help optimize outcomes in these difficult to treat disorders of early childhood.", "doi": "10.1016/j.spen.2017.10.008", "title": "Early Life Epilepsies are a Comorbidity of Developmental Brain Disorders.", "journal": ["Seminars in pediatric neurology", "Semin Pediatr Neurol"]}
