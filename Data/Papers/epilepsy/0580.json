Then, a microdialysis sampling technique coupled with two validated chromatographic systems was developed for the continuous measurement of the protein-unbound form of LTG in the rat plasma and hippocampus after administering two kinds of micelles and LTG solution intranasally.The drug loading and mean size of LTG-loaded micelles and LTG-loaded mixed micelles prepared with optimal formulation were 36.44%\u00b10.14%, 39.28%\u00b10.26%, 122.9, and 183.5 nm, respectively, with a core-shell structure. The cumulative release rate in vivo of LTG-loaded mixed micelles was 84.21% at 24 hours and showed more sustained release while that of LTG-loaded micelles was 80.61% at 6 hours. The Tmax and area under concentration-time curve from zero to time of last quantifiable concentration of LTG solution, LTG-loaded micelles, and LTG-loaded mixed micelles were 55, 35, and 15 minutes and about 5,384, 16,500, and 25,245 (min\u22c5\u03bcg)/L in the hippocampus, respectively.The results revealed that LTG-loaded mPEG-PLA/TPGS mixed micelles enhanced the absorption of LTG at the nasal cavity and reduced the efflux of LTG in the brain, suggesting that the function of TPGS inhibited P-glycoprotein and LTG-loaded mPEG-PLA/TPGS mixed micelles had the potential to overcome refractory epilepsy.", "doi": "10.2147/IJN.S145488", "title": "mPEG-PLA/TPGS mixed micelles via intranasal administration improved the bioavailability of lamotrigine in the hippocampus.", "journal": ["International journal of nanomedicine", "Int J Nanomedicine"]}
