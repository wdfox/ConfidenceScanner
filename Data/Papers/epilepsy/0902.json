Next, we performed knock-down (shRNA) and rescue experiments by overexpressing wild-type and mutant human \u03b4-catenin (CTNND2) proteins in cortical mouse neurons and compared the results with morphologic abnormalities in the postmortem FCMTE brain.We identified a missense mutation, p.Glu1044Lys, in the CTNND2 gene that cosegregated with the FCMTE phenotype. The knock-down of Ctnnd2 in cultured cortical mouse neurons revealed increased neurite outgrowth that was rescued by overexpression of wild-type, but not mutant, CTNND2 and was reminiscent of the morphologic abnormalities observed in cerebellar Purkinje cells from patients with FCMTE.We propose CTNND2 as the causal gene in FCMTE3. Functional testing of the mutant protein revealed abnormal neuronal sprouting, consistent with the abnormal cerebellar Purkinje cell morphology in patients with FCMTE.", "doi": "10.1212/WNL.0000000000004709", "title": "\u03b4-Catenin (CTNND2) missense mutation in familial cortical myoclonic tremor and epilepsy.", "journal": ["Neurology", "Neurology"]}
