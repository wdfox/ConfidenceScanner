Many patients undergoing hemispherectomy are younger patients with dysmorphic brains, making accomplishing a complete disconnection\u00a0challenging due to anatomic distortion, even with the aid of intraoperative navigation. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been proposed as a valuable imaging adjunct perioperatively to help guide surgeons intraoperatively, as well as for post-surgical evaluation and confirmation of complete hemispheric disconnection.\u00a0We present a case of an infant with Otoharra syndrome and hemimegencephaly who underwent a functional hemispherectomy for treatment of severe, refractory seizures. We demonstrate how DTI was utilized both pre-, intra-, and postoperatively to help plan, guide, and confirm surgical disconnection. The application of exquisite DTI for this child led to her being seizure-free, which is a life-changing event with long-lasting benefits and will become even more critical as we now perform these disconnection procedures with a more minimally invasive approach.", "doi": "10.7759/cureus.1697", "title": "Diffusion Tensor Imaging in an Infant Undergoing Functional Hemispherectomy: A Surgical Aid.", "journal": ["Cureus", "Cureus"]}
