The primary endpoint was DVT occurrence. Serial levels of serum D-dimer, soluble fibrin, and thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT) were analyzed.Twenty-four of 92 patients (26.1%) had DVT, of which 10 (41.7%) patients were diagnosed preoperatively. In patients with preoperative DVT, age, incidence of decreased performance status and leg paresis, levels of D-dimer, soluble fibrin, and TAT were significantly higher. In patients with postoperative DVT, length of surgery, incidence of decreased postoperative performance status, levels of D-dimer on postoperative days (POD) 3, 7, and 14, and TAT on POD7 were significantly higher. Patients with postoperative DVT had elevated D-dimer levels on POD7 compared to POD3. The D-dimer cutoff of 2.65 \u03bcg/mL at POD7 could be used to identify DVT with 85.7% sensitivity and 72.3% specificity. A cutoff of 5.25 at POD7 \u03bcg/mL yielded a specificity of 96.9%. Decreased performance status and elevated D-dimer were independent predictors for preoperative DVT, prolonged operation time and elevated D-dimer on POD7 for postoperative DVT.DVT was frequently observed in patients before and after undergoing craniotomies. Patients with decreased performance status should be preoperatively screened for DVT by checking D-dimer levels. Elevated D-dimer levels on POD7 compared to POD3, and D-dimer levels above 2.65 \u03bcg/mL at POD7 suggest the presence of DVT.", "doi": "10.1016/j.wneu.2017.12.139", "title": "High incidence of deep vein thrombosis in the perioperative period of neurosurgical patients.", "journal": ["World neurosurgery", "World Neurosurg"]}
