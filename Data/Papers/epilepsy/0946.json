Data on clinical features of MS were retrieved from the Swedish MS register, and data on epilepsy and death were retrieved from comprehensive patient registers.The cumulative incidence of epilepsy was 3.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.17-3.76) in patients with MS and 1.4% (95% CI 1.30-1.52) in controls (risk ratio 2.5, 95% CI 2.19-2.76). In a Cox proportional model, MS increased the risk of epilepsy (hazard ratio 3.2, 95% CI 2.64-3.94). Patients with relapsing-remitting MS had a cumulative incidence of epilepsy of 2.2% (95% CI 1.88-2.50), whereas patients with progressive disease had a cumulative incidence of 5.5% (95% CI 4.89-6.09). The cumulative incidence rose continuously with increasing disease duration to 5.9% (95% CI 4.90-7.20) in patients with disease duration \u226534 years. Patients with an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score \u22657 had a cumulative incidence of epilepsy of 5.3% (95% CI 3.95-7.00). Disease duration and EDSS score were associated with epilepsy after multiple logistic regression (odds ratio [OR] 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.04 per year, p = 0.001; and OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.09-1.26 per EDSS step, p < 0.0001).Epilepsy is more common among patients with MS than in the general population, and a diagnosis of MS increases the risk of epilepsy. Our data suggest a direct link between severity of MS and epilepsy.", "doi": "10.1212/WNL.0000000000004740", "title": "Epilepsy in multiple sclerosis: A nationwide population-based register study.", "journal": ["Neurology", "Neurology"]}
