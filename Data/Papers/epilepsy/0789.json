It seems that all these activities are related to boldine ability to scavenge reactive free radicals. As indicated by several pieces of evidence, free radicals generation are involved in initiation and propagation of epilepsy.In this study, we investigated the sub-chronic effects of boldine on intraperitoneal and intravenous pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) models and electroshock-induced seizure in mice. Mice in treatment groups received different doses of boldine (once in a day for 8\u00a0days, ip.) and control group received solvent. We also evaluated the role of antioxidant activity of boldine as a part of its anti-seizure activity.The results demonstrated that sub-chronic administration of boldine increased time latencies to the onset of myoclonic and clonic seizure induced by intraperitoneal PTZ model and increased clonic seizure threshold in intravenous PTZ model. It also decreased tonic hind limb extension duration in the electroshock-induced seizure model. Co-administration of boldine with a non-effective dose of vitamin C induced the anticonvulsant activity of vitamin C. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in the brain tissue of animals was increased following sub-chronic administration of boldine which all indicated antioxidant activity of boldine may be a part of its anticonvulsant activity.The anticonvulsant effects of boldine in three different animal models of epilepsy have been indicated. We have also shown that the antioxidant role of boldine might be a part of its anticonvulsant effect.", "doi": "10.1080/01616412.2017.1402500", "title": "Sub-chronic boldine treatment exerts anticonvulsant effects in mice.", "journal": ["Neurological research", "Neurol.
