Many herbal extracts are considered as alternative therapeutic method for epilepsy management. In the present study, we investigated the effect of Withania somnifera (WS) root extract and Withanolide A (WA) in the management of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy. Confocal imaging of TOPRO-3 stained cortical sections showed severe damage in epileptic brain. We also observed a reduced antioxidant potential and increased peroxide level in epileptic group. Oxidative stress resulted in the down regulation of CREB, NF-\u03baB and TNF-\u03b1 with an up regulation of the apoptotic factors Caspase 8, 3 and bax in epileptic group. Epileptic condition also resulted in an increased muscarinic receptor binding and mRNA expression in the cerebral cortex. Withania somnifera and Withanolide A significantly reversed the altered muscarinic receptor expression and reversed the oxidative stress and resultant derailment in cell signalling. Thus our studies suggest that Withania somnifera and Withanolide A play an important role in central muscarinic receptor functional balance and activation of antioxidant system in the cerebral cortex of temporal lobe epileptic condition. These findings can be of immense therapeutic significance for epileptic management.", "doi": "10.1139/bcb-2017-0198", "title": "Altered muscarinic receptor expression in the cerebral cortex of epileptic rats: Restorative role of Withania somnifera.", "journal": ["Biochemistry and cell biology = Biochimie et biologie cellulaire", "Biochem.
