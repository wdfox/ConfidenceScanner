Mutations of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are maternally inherited and lead to mitochondrial cytopathies with predominant neurologic manifestations: psychomotor retardation, epilepsy, ataxia, neuropathy, and myopathy. Given the ubiquitous nature of mitochondria, cellular dysfunction can also appear in tissues with high metabolic turnover; thus, there can be cardiac, digestive, ophthalmologic, and kidney complications. Mutations in the MT-ATP6 gene of mtDNA have been shown to cause NARP syndrome without renal involvement. We report a patient who had NARP syndrome diagnosed at age 11 years in whom glomerular proteinuria was present very early after diagnosis. Although neurologic manifestations were stable over time, he developed worsening proteinuria and kidney function. He started dialysis therapy at age 21 years. Kidney biopsy confirmed the mitochondrial cytopathy histologically, with abnormal mitochondria seen on electron microscopy. The MT-ATP6 gene mutation was detected in the kidney biopsy specimen.", "doi": "10.1053/j.ajkd.2017.09.020", "title": "Renal Involvement in Neuropathy, Ataxia, Retinitis Pigmentosa (NARP) Syndrome: A Case Report.", "journal": ["American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation", "Am.
