This study investigates the existing evidence, which describes the treatment effects on seizure frequency as well as improvement of cognition in children with rolandic epilepsy. We conclude, that treatment with anti-epileptic drugs could be justified, if treatment reduces seizures, prevents the evolution to atypical forms, or diminishes the negative cognitive consequences associated with the disease. Levetiracetam and sulthiame are the recommended treatments according to the existing evidence, which is still insufficient. A larger randomized controlled trial is warranted.", "doi": null, "title": "[Treatment of rolandic epilepsy].", "journal": ["Ugeskrift for laeger", "Ugeskr. Laeg."]}
