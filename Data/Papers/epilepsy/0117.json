Recent epidemiological studies suggest that Onchocerca volvulus infection is the trigger causing the seizures, which appear in previously healthy children between the ages of 3 and 18 years. Persons with onchocerciasis-associated epilepsy present with a wide spectrum of seizures, including atonic and myoclonic neck seizures; but also absences and most frequently generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Often individuals present with intellectual disabilities and psychiatric disorders and occasionally with 'Nakalanga' features such as severe stunting with delayed or absent external signs of sexual development. Onchocerciasis-associated epilepsy, because of its importance as a public health problem, is an additional reason for strengthening onchocerciasis elimination programs.", "doi": "10.1016/j.pt.2017.11.009", "title": "Onchocerciasis-Associated Epilepsy, an Additional Reason for Strengthening Onchocerciasis Elimination Programs.", "journal": ["Trends in parasitology", "Trends Parasitol."]}
