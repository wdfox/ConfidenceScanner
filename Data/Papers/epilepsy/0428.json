Partial merosin deficiency can be caused not only by primarily LAMA2 mutations, but also secondarily by dystroglycanopathy. Although it can be molecularly diagnosed based on a genetic analysis, this method is labor-intensive because of its huge genome size. A 26-year-old male patient presented with mild muscular weakness, joint contractures, and epilepsy. Double immunofluorescence staining of a muscle biopsy specimen showed mislocalization of merosin, and a genetic analysis revealed a homozygous c.818G>A (p.Arg273Lys) mutation in LAMA2. Double immunofluorescence staining and whole exome sequencing were useful for the diagnosis of partial merosin deficiency.", "doi": "10.2169/internalmedicine.9588-17", "title": "A Homozygous LAMA2 Mutation of c.818G>A Caused Partial Merosin Deficiency in a Japanese patient.", "journal": ["Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)", "Intern.
