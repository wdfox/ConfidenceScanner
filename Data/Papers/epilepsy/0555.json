Drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DRESS) accompanied by hyponatremia, thrombocytopenia, hypoalbuminemia and elevated aminotransferase has never been reported as an adverse effect of VPA monotherapy during titration for epilepsy in Asian population. Hereby, we present the case of a 73-year-old Chinese male who suffered from DRESS and other complications two weeks after initiating VPA treatment for epilepsy. Understanding the risk associated with VPA-induced DRESS, and taking effective measures to avoid the severe side effects are necessary.", "doi": "10.1016/j.ebcr.2017.06.003", "title": "Drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome caused by valproic acid as a monotherapy for epilepsy: First case report in Asian population.", "journal": ["Epilepsy & behavior case reports", "Epilepsy Behav Case Rep"]}
