The cohort consisted of 104 subjects, 50 (48.1%) male, 39 (37.5%) aged \u226565 years, with a mean APACHE II score of 17.88. Four models of the APACHE II system were assessed: numerical score, adjusted score mortality, category, and category mortality. All models demonstrated poor calibration and discrimination, even after adjustment for significantly different covariates. There were independent associations between mortality and acute or toxic-metabolic seizure etiologies, myoclonic seizures, and postoperative status. After multivariate adjustment, only the association with toxic-metabolic seizure etiologies remained. The APACHE II score is a poor predictor of mortality in intensive care unit patients with status epilepticus. Further investigation is warranted to develop better measures of acute physiological disease severity in status epilepticus and its impact on mortality.", "doi": "10.1177/1751143717715967", "title": "Mortality prediction in status epilepticus with the APACHE II score.", "journal": ["Journal of the Intensive Care Society", "J Intensive Care Soc"]}
