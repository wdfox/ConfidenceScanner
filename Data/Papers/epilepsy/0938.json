Eighty patients with non-lesional temporal lobe epilepsy with or without bilateral tonic-clonic propagation were analyzed. Age at seizure onset was defined as age at the first unequivocal seizure (excluding febrile convulsions). ApoE alleles were determined by a procedure where genome DNA was amplified by chain reaction along with polymerase, using the LightCycler kit (Roche) for ApoE mutations on codons 112 and 158. There was a statistically significant difference between the groups of patients with ApoE \u03b52/3 and \u03b53/4 genotypes (p=0.03), but not between patients with ApoE , \u03b52/3 and \u03b53/3, and those with ApoE \u03b53/4 and \u03b53/3. In conclusion, the results of our study suggested positive association of a specific ApoE genotype and onset of non-lesional temporal lobe epilepsy.", "doi": null, "title": "IS APOLIPOPROTEIN E \u03b52 ASSOCIATED WITH DELAYED ONSET OF NON-LESIONAL TEMPORAL LOBE EPILEPSY?", "journal": ["Acta clinica Croatica", "Acta Clin Croat"]}
