In heterologous systems, LTG inhibits Cav2.3 (R-type) calcium currents, which contribute to kainic-acid- (KA) induced epilepsy in vivo. To gain insight into the role of R-type currents in LTG drug action in vivo, we compared the effects of LTG to topiramate and lacosamide in Cav2.3-deficient mice and controls on KA-induced seizures.Behavioral seizure rating and quantitative electrocorticography were performed after injection of 20 mg/kg [and 30 mg/kg] KA. One hour before KA injection, mice were pretreated with either 30 mg/kg LTG, 50 mg/kg topiramate (TPM) or 30 mg/kg lacosamide (LSM).Ablation of Cav2.3 reduced total seizure scores by 28.6% (p=0.0012) and pretreatment with LTG reduced seizure activity of control mice by 23.2% (p=0.02). In Cav2.3-deficient mice LTG pretreatment increased seizure activity by 22.1% (p=0.018) and increased the percentage of degenerated CA1 pyramidal neurons (p=0.02). All three tested AEDs reduced seizure activity in control mice, however only the non-calcium channel modulating AED, LSM had an anticonvulsive effect in Cav2.3-deficient mice. Furthermore LTG altered electrocorticographic parameters differently in the two genotypes, decreasing relative power of ictal spikes in control mice compared to Cav2.3-defcient mice.These findings give first in vivo evidence for an essential role for Cav2.3 in LTG pharmacology and shed light on a paradoxical effect of LTG in their absence. Furthermore, LTG appears to promote ictal activity in Cav2.3-deficient mice resulting in increased neurotoxicity in the CA1 region. This paradoxical mechanism, possibly reflecting rebound hyperexcitation of pyramidal CA1 neurons after increased inhibition, may be key in understanding LTG-induced seizure aggravation, observed in clinical practice.", "doi": "10.1159/000485361", "title": "Cav2.3 (R-Type) Calcium Channels are Critical for Mediating Anticonvulsive and Neuroprotective Properties of Lamotrigine In Vivo.", "journal": ["Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology", "Cell.
