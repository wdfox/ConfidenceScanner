These compounds, which are the first tellurium-containing derivatives acting as inhibitors of carbonic anhydrase enzymes, showed effective inhibition against all isoforms investigated and some of them were selective for inhibiting the cytosolic or the membrane-bound CAs. Thus, these carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are interesting leads for the development of isoform-selective inhibitors.", "doi": "10.1016/j.bioorg.2017.12.010", "title": "First evaluation of organotellurium derivatives as carbonic anhydrase I, II, IV, VII and IX inhibitors.", "journal": ["Bioorganic chemistry", "Bioorg.
