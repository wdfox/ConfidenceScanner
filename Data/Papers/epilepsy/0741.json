Methods: From January 2006 to October 2015, 152 patients with HLH, 88 patients had CNS involvement, their clinical data were collected, and survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier life table method, univariate and multivariate Cox regression model analyses were applied to identify the risk factors of prognosis. Results: \u246057.9% patients complicated with neurological symptoms, cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities were observed in 37.0% patients, 57.5% patients had abnormal neuroradiology. \u246136 patients survived well, 3 patients lost to follow-up, 49 dead, 1 survival patient had epilepsy. \u2462The 3-year overall survival rate of 88 patients was 44%. \u2463abnormal CSF and unreceived IT bore a significant, independent adverse prognostic value (P<0.05) . Conclusion: CNS involvement in HLH has a high frequency and poor prognosis, few patients remained neurologic sequelae; abnormal CSF related to poor prognosis, positive intrathecal injections could improve the prognosis.\u76ee\u7684\uff1a \u4e86\u89e3\u4e2d\u67a2\u795e\u7ecf\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08CNS\uff09\u53d7\u7d2f\u7684\u513f\u7ae5\u566c\u8840\u7ec6\u80de\u6dcb\u5df4\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7ec6\u80de\u589e\u751f\u75c7\uff08HLH\uff09\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u7279\u5f81\u53ca\u9884\u540e\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\u3002 \u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a \u56de\u987e\u6027\u5206\u67902006\u5e741\u6708\u81f32015\u5e7410\u6708\u8bca\u6cbb\u768488\u4f8b\u6709CNS\u53d7\u7d2fHLH\u60a3\u513f\u4e34\u5e8a\u8d44\u6599\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Kaplan-Meier\u6cd5\u7ed8\u5236\u751f\u5b58\u66f2\u7ebf\uff0c\u5efa\u7acbCox\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u9884\u540e\u7684\u5371\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u8fdb\u884c\u5355\u56e0\u7d20\u53ca\u591a\u56e0\u7d20\u5206\u6790\u3002 \u7ed3\u679c\uff1a \u246088\u4f8bCNS\u53d7\u7d2f\u7684HLH\u60a3\u513f\u4e2d\uff0c\u753738\u4f8b\uff0c\u597350\u4f8b\uff0c\u4e2d\u4f4d\u5e74\u9f844\u5c811\u4e2a\u6708\uff086\u4e2a\u6708~15\u5c8110\u4e2a\u6708\uff09\uff0c\u5360\u540c\u671f\u8bca\u6cbbHLH\u60a3\u513f\u6bd4\u4f8b\u768457.9%\uff0888/152\uff09\u3002\u246188\u4f8b\u60a3\u513f\u4e2d\u670954\u4f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u8111\u810a\u6db2\u68c0\u67e5\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d20\u4f8b\uff0837.0%\uff09\u8111\u810a\u6db2\u5f02\u5e38\uff1b\u670973\u4f8b\u60a3\u513f\u8fdb\u884c\u5934\u9885\u5f71\u50cf\u5b66\u68c0\u67e5\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d42\u4f8b\uff0857.5%\uff09\u5f71\u50cf\u5b66\u5f02\u5e38\u3002\u246288\u4f8b\u60a3\u513f\u4e2d3\u4f8b\u5931\u8bbf\uff0c36\u4f8b\u5b58\u6d3b\uff081\u4f8b\u7ee7\u53d1\u766b\u75eb\uff09\uff0c49\u4f8b\u6b7b\u4ea1\u3002\u4e2d\u4f4d\u968f\u8bbf\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3a37\uff086~122\uff09\u4e2a\u6708\uff0c3\u5e74\u603b\u4f53\u751f\u5b58\u7387\u4e3a44%\u3002\u2463\u591a\u56e0\u7d20\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8111\u810a\u6db2\u5f02\u5e38\uff08HR=3.467\uff0c95%CI 1.276~9.423\uff0cP=0.015\uff09\u3001\u672a\u7ed9\u4e88\u9798\u6ce8\uff08HR=0.231\uff0c95%CI 0.081~0.657\uff0cP=0.006\uff09\u662f\u5f71\u54cdCNS-HLH\u60a3\u513f\u9884\u540e\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u5371\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u3002 \u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a HLH\u60a3\u513fCNS\u53d7\u7d2f\u7387\u8f83\u9ad8\uff0c\u9884\u540e\u5dee\uff0c\u5c11\u6570\u8fd8\u4f1a\u9057\u7559\u795e\u7ecf\u7cfb\u7edf\u540e\u9057\u75c7\uff1b\u8111\u810a\u6db2\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u60a3\u513f\u9884\u540e\u4e0d\u826f\uff0c\u79ef\u6781\u7684\u9798\u6ce8\u6cbb\u7597\u53ef\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u9884\u540e\u3002.", "doi": null, "title": "[Prognosis of the central nervous system involvement in patients with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis].", "journal": ["Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi", "Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi"]}
