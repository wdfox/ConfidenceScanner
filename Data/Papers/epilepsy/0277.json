In contrast, they had significantly higher serum levels of small low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) particles and were significantly more likely to have LDL pattern B in which small LDL particles predominate when compared with controls. However, there was no significant difference in cIMT or plaque presence between groups.Our results provide clinical evidence demonstrating the cardiovascular safety of a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet used in adults with epilepsy for at least 12months. It also highlights potential markers of cardiovascular risk - small dense LDL particles - that should be closely monitored in adults treated with diet therapy long-term.", "doi": "10.1016/j.yebeh.2017.10.035", "title": "Impact of the modified Atkins diet on cardiovascular health in adults with epilepsy.", "journal": ["Epilepsy & behavior : E&B", "Epilepsy Behav"]}
