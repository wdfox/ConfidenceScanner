The assay uses a simple solid-phase extraction for sample preparation and direct injection of the extract into the chromatograph. Flupirtine is used as an internal standard. Chromatographic separation is achieved on a C18 Chromolith column (Chromolith Performance, 100 \u00d7 4.6\u2009mm i.d.), using as mobile phase water/acetonitrile/methanol (72:18:10\u2009v/v/v) mixed with 0.1% of 85% phosphoric acid. Isocratic elution is conducted at a flow rate of 1.5\u2009mL min-1 . The total duration of a chromatographic run is 7\u2009min. Calibration curves are linear over the 25-2000\u2009ng mL-1 concentration range, with a limit of quantitation of 25\u2009ng mL-1 . Other performance characteristics include high precision (intra- and inter-day coefficients of variation \u226412.6%) and high accuracy (99.7%-108.7%). The method is suitable for the investigation of concentration-response relationships in patients receiving therapeutic doses of retigabine.", "doi": "10.1002/bmc.4168", "title": "A simple and rapid HPLC-UV method for the determination of retigabine in human plasma.", "journal": ["Biomedical chromatography : BMC", "Biomed.
