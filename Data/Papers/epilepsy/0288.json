Patients were randomized (1:1:1:1) to receive once-daily placebo or perampanel 4, 8, or 12\u00a0mg over a 6-week titration and 13-week maintenance double-blind period. Enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs were equally stratified between groups. The primary efficacy endpoint was percent change in POS frequency per 28\u00a0days (double-blind phase vs baseline). Other efficacy endpoints included \u226550% responder rate and seizure freedom. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were also monitored.Of 710 randomized patients, seizure frequency data were available for 704 patients. Median percent changes in POS frequency per 28\u00a0days indicated dose-proportional reductions in seizure frequency: -10.8% with placebo and -17.3% (P\u00a0=\u00a0.2330), -29.0% (P\u00a0=\u00a0.0003), and -38.0% (P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001) with perampanel 4, 8, and 12\u00a0mg, respectively. In total, 108 (15.3%) patients discontinued treatment; 44 (6.2%) due to TEAEs. TEAEs occurring in \u22655% of patients, and reported at least twice as frequently with perampanel vs placebo, included dizziness and irritability.Adjunctive perampanel (8 and 12\u00a0mg/d) significantly improved seizure control in patients with refractory POS. Safety and tolerability were acceptable at daily doses of perampanel 4-12\u00a0mg.", "doi": "10.1111/ane.12883", "title": "Adjunctive perampanel in partial-onset seizures: Asia-Pacific, randomized phase III study.", "journal": ["Acta neurologica Scandinavica", "Acta Neurol.
