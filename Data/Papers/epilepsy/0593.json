The mean duration of VPA therapy was 2.5\u00b11.4years, and with LEV was 2.3\u00b11.6years. Mean calcium and 25-OHD levels were significantly higher (p <0.05) in the control group. There was a negative correlation (p <0.01) between 25-OHD and VPA levels (r=-0.442). Vitamin D deficiency (%) was significantly higher (p <0.05) in VPA (24.1%) and LEV (35.5%) groups than in control group (14%). The multiple logistic regression analysis showed that VPA monotherapy (OR: 1.9, CI 95%: 1.1-3.8) and LEV monotherapy (OR: 3.3, CI 95%: 1.5-7.5) were associated with an increased risk of vitamin D deficiency.The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is common in children with epilepsy taking VPA or LEV. Hence vitamin D status of children treated with VPA and LEV should be regularly monitored and vitamin D supplements should be considered on an individual basis.", "doi": "10.1016/j.eplepsyres.2017.11.013", "title": "Vitamin D deficiency in children with epilepsy taking valproate and levetiracetam as monotherapy.", "journal": ["Epilepsy research", "Epilepsy Res."]}
