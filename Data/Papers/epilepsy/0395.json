Research to overcome this hurdle is gaining momentum through international research collaboration and a series of genetic and molecular discoveries in the last few years, which have advanced our knowledge of this rare synucleinopathy. In MSA, the discovery of \u03b1-synuclein pathology and glial cytoplasmic inclusions remain the most significant findings. Families with certain types of \u03b1-synuclein mutations develop diseases that mimic MSA, and the spectrum of clinical and pathological features in these families suggests a spectrum of severity, from late-onset Parkinson's disease to MSA. Nonetheless, controversies persist, such as the role of common \u03b1-synuclein variants in MSA and whether this disorder shares a common mechanism of spreading pathology with other protein misfolding neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we review these issues, specifically focusing on \u03b1-synuclein mutations.", "doi": "10.12688/f1000research.12193.1", "title": "Multiple system atrophy: genetic risks and alpha-synuclein mutations.", "journal": ["F1000Research", "F1000Res"]}
