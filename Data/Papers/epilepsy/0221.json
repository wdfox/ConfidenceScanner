We evaluated the maternal characteristics, pregnancy and neonatal outcomes and the relationship between cancer treatments and these outcomes.The total number of CCSs was 61, and the total number of deliveries was 71, corresponding to 0.019% of total deliveries. Regarding cancer, 46% of the cases had leukemia. Epilepsy was seen in 7 (11%) cases. The mean gestational age at delivery was 37.9 weeks. The rate of preterm delivery was 24%. The mean birth weight was 2,718 g. There were 3 congenital anomalies (4.2%). The rate of preterm delivery was higher and the mean birth weight lighter in the women treated with radiotherapy than in those without radiotherapy (42% vs. 16%, P=0.025; 2,436 \u00b1 737 g vs. 2,827 \u00b1 483 g, P=0.010). The adjusted odds ratio of radiotherapy for preterm deliveries was 3.53 (P=0.049).Although the number of deliveries of CCSs was small in Japan, the pregnancy outcomes were favorable. The important points for managing pregnancies in CCSs were preterm delivery due to obstetrical complications, especially in CCSs with radiotherapy, and epilepsy as maternal complications that were suspected to be related to previously received treatments.
