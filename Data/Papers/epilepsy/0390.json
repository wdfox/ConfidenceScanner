We examined a possible association between maternal RA and 15 selected groups of chronic diseases in the offspring.This nationwide cohort study was based on the Danish health registries and included data on all children born alive in Denmark from January 1st 1989 to December 31st 2013. The cohort comprised 2106 children born by women with RA (exposed), and 1 378 539 children born by women without RA (unexposed). Cox proportional hazard regression models were used, taking a large range of confounders into consideration, computing the Hazard Ratios (HR) of child- and adolescence diseases.In children being exposed to maternal RA in utero, the HR's of thyroid diseases was 2.19 (95% CI, 1.14 - 4.21), epilepsy 1.61 (95% CI, 1.16 - 2.25), and RA 2.89 (95% CI, 2.06 - 4.05). The HR's for anxiety and personality disorders and chronic lung disease including asthma were in the range of 1.15 - 1.16, but these were not statistically significant.Our results suggest that in utero exposure to maternal RA is associated with an increased risk of thyroid disease and epilepsy in childhood and adolescence, and in particular an increased risk of RA, compared to children born by mothers without RA. These important findings should encourage pediatricians and general practitioners to an increased awareness of certain chronic diseases in children being exposed to RA in utero.
