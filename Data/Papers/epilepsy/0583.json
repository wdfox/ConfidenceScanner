Studies in tumor-related epilepsy and venous thromboembolism provide data for the clinician to make evidence-based decisions about perioperative management, prophylaxis, and therapy. Patients with brain tumors experience unique toxicities related to novel drugs and chemotherapeutics that result in hematologic, infectious, and endocrine disorders. Recent work that has focused on quality of life in patients with brain tumors highlights the importance of good supportive care and optimal medical management of neurobehavioral symptoms and late complications of treatment.A thorough understanding of the variety of medical and neurologic complications in patients with primary brain tumors improves the clinician's ability to quickly recognize and manage common and urgent conditions.", "doi": "10.1212/CON.0000000000000540", "title": "Medical Complications of Brain Tumors.", "journal": ["Continuum (Minneapolis, Minn.)", "Continuum (Minneap Minn)"]}
