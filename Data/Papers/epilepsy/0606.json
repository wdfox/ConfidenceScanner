The objective of this study was to account for the decrease in the frequency and/or monthly duration of epileptic seizures in paediatric patients with drug-resistant epilepsy treated with antiepileptic drugs, before and after adding intravenous immunoglobulin G (iIV IgG).This is an analytic, observational, retrospective case-control study. We studied paediatric patients with drug-resistant epilepsy who were treated with IV IgG at the Centro M\u00e9dico Nacional 20 de Noviembre, in Mexico City, from 2003 to 2013.One hundred and sixty seven patients (19.5%) had drug-resistant epilepsy and 44 (5.1%) started adjuvant treatment with IV IgG. The mean age of patients at the beginning of treatment was 6.12 years\u00b15.14); aetiology was structural acquired in 28 patients (73.6%), genetic in 5 (13.1%), immune in 1 (2.6%), and unknown in 4 (10.5%). At 2 months from starting IV IgG, seizure duration had reduced to 66.66%; the frequency of seizures was reduced by 64% at 4 months after starting treatment (P<.001).According to the results of this study, intravenous immunoglobulin may be an effective therapy for reducing the frequency and duration of seizures in paediatric patients with drug-resistant epilepsy.", "doi": "10.1016/j.nrl.2017.09.005", "title": "Intravenous immunoglobulin G as adjuvant treatment in drug-resistant childhood epilepsy.", "journal": ["Neurologia (Barcelona, Spain)", "Neurologia"]}
