Thirty iEEG recordings from 10 temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients around seizure onset were investigated. Physiologically meaningful parameters [average excitatory (Ae ), slow (B), and fast (G) inhibitory synaptic gain] were identified during interictal to ictal transition. Four ratios (Ae /G, Ae /B, Ae /(B\u00a0+\u00a0G), and B/G) were derived from these parameters, and their evolution over time was analyzed. The excitation/inhibition ratio increased around seizure onset and decreased before seizure offset, indicating the impairment and re-emergence of excitation/inhibition balance around seizure onset and before seizure offset, respectively. Moreover, the slow inhibition may have an earlier effect on excitation/inhibition imbalance. We confirm the decrease in excitation/inhibition ratio upon seizure termination in human temporal lobe epilepsy, as revealed by optogenetic approaches both in\u00a0vivo in animal models and in\u00a0vitro. The increase in excitation/inhibition ratio around seizure occurrence could be an indicator to detect seizures.", "doi": "10.1111/ejn.13812", "title": "Dynamics underlying interictal to ictal transition in temporal lobe epilepsy: insights from a neural mass model.", "journal": ["The European journal of neuroscience", "Eur.
