This study was conducted to aim to analyze whether values of the biomarkers for heart failure are associated with the SUCD. Serum concentrations of N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 were analyzed in 57 nonelderly patients with SUCD who was diagnosed at medicolegal autopsy. The subjects were divided into 3 subgroups according to the medical history: (1) epilepsy, (2) psychiatric disorders, and (3) no specific medical history. The results showed that serum hs-CRP levels were significantly high in patients with epilepsy (P = 0.01) or psychiatric disorders (P = 0.01) as compared with the controls. Also, significantly high concentrations of hs-CRP were observed in psychiatric patients with schizophrenia, compared with the controls (P = 0.003) or the other psychiatric diseases (P = 0.01). The level of N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 did not show a significant difference between the SUCD and the controls. These results might suggest the association between high serum hs-CRP levels and the potential impairment of the cardiac function before the fatal event.", "doi": "10.1097/PAF.0000000000000361", "title": "Exploration of Predictive Biomarkers for Sudden Unexplained Cardiac Death in Nonelderly People: A Case-Control Study With Biochemical Parameters Related to Heart Failure.", "journal": ["The American journal of forensic medicine and pathology", "Am J Forensic Med Pathol"]}
