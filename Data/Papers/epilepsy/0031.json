The primary outcome evaluated was the psychiatric diagnosis. Covariables assessed included sociodemographic data, details of seizures and treatment taken. Study population included 143 WWE. Thirty women with a chronic disease, viz., Diabetes and with no h/o seizures, and another group of 25 healthy women from the community with no seizures ever and no Diabetes, were evaluated as 2 sets of controls.One hundred and forty three women with Epilepsy (WWE) were recruited into the study. Psychiatric co-morbidity prevalence was 28.6 % (41/143) in WWE, 13.7 % in women with Diabetes and 8.3 % in women with no Epilepsy or Diabetes (normal controls). Overall, Depression was the commonest psychiatric co-morbidity. Psychiatric co-morbidity was significantly more in WWE as compared to normal controls. Seizure duration over 2 years, complex partial seizures and Polypharmacy were significantly linked to Psychiatric co-morbidities.", "doi": null, "title": "Psychiatric Co-morbidities in Women with Epilepsy.", "journal": ["The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India", "J Assoc Physicians India"]}
