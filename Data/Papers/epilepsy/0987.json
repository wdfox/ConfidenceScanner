Secondary outcomes of interest were adverse events and admission/discharge outcomes.Records of all patients\u226518years old diagnosed with GCSE between June 2012 and September 2015 and transported by EMS to our hospital ED were reviewed.Of 44 patients analyzed, 43 (98%) had a history of epilepsy. Benzodiazepine utilization varied; EMS preferred midazolam (69% of cases) while the ED utilized lorazepam (91% of cases). Benzodiazepine dosages used were lower than guideline recommendations. Seizure activity was aborted with benzodiazepines alone in 22 (50%) patients. Twelve patients (27%) experienced seizure recurrence following SE treatment and achievement of seizure cessation. Twenty-three (52%) patients required intubation after arrival to ED. All 44 patients were admitted; 30 (68%) required admission to the intensive care unit.There was consistent underdosing of benzodiazepines in treatment of GCSE in both EMS and ED settings likely resulting in underachievement of seizure cessation, while intubation rates were higher than reported when compared to previous studies. Prospective studies are needed to identify barriers to optimal benzodiazepine usage in GCSE patients.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jns.2017.09.031", "title": "Impact of non-guideline-based treatment of status epilepticus.", "journal": ["Journal of the neurological sciences", "J.
