Penicillin is commonly used for establishment of experimental epilepsy models. Previous studies have demonstrated that astragaloside IV (3-o-\u03b2-d-xylopyranosyl-6-o-\u03b2-d-glucopyranosyl-cycloastragenol; AS\u2011IV) has comprehensive pharmacological functions on the attenuation of inflammation. In the present study, primary astrocyte cell cultures were divided into three groups: Control group, penicillin (2,500\u00a0\u00b5M) treatment group (epilepsy model), and penicillin+AS\u2011IV (20, 40, 80 and 160\u00a0\u00b5mol/l) treatment group. The expression levels of inflammatory factors, including interleukin\u20111\u03b2 and tumor necrosis factor\u2011\u03b1, were determined in the groups using western blot and reverse transcription\u2011quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses. The levels of members of the phosphorylated\u2011mitogen\u2011activated protein kinase (p\u2011MAPK) family, including p\u2011c\u2011Jun N\u2011terminal kinase 1/2, p\u2011extracellular signal\u2011regulated protein kinase 1/2 and p\u2011p38, were determined using western blot analysis. Cell viability of the astrocytes was detected using a 3\u2011(4,5\u2011dimethyl\u20112\u2011thiazolyl)\u20112,5\u2011diphenyl\u20112\u2011H\u2011tetrazolium bromide assay and cell proliferation was evaluated using a Cell Counting Kit\u20118 assay. The results revealed that AS\u2011IV significantly suppressed the expression of penicillin\u2011induced inflammatory factors in the astrocytes at the transcriptional and translational levels, and occurred in a dose\u2011dependent manner. The penicillin\u2011induced increase in the protein levels of the the p\u2011MAPK family were notably decreased by AS\u2011IV. In addition, the penicillin\u2011induced downregulation of primary astrocyte viability/cell proliferation was significantly reversed by the administration of AS\u2011IV. From these results, it was concluded that AS\u2011IV suppressed the penicillin\u2011induced upregulation of inflammatory factors and p\u2011MAPK in astrocytes, ultimately attenuating epilepsy.", "doi": "10.3892/mmr.2017.7896", "title": "Astragaloside IV attenuates penicillin-induced epilepsy via inhibiting activation of the MAPK signaling pathway.", "journal": ["Molecular medicine reports", "Mol Med Rep"]}
