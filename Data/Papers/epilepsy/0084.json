In total, 108 patients surveyed in 43 pharmacies (Group P) and 118 patients treated by the specialized neurologists (Group N) completed anonymously a questionnaire on intake of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). The statistical evaluation was performed using nonparametric tests and logistic regression analyses.Group N more often used adherence aids, compared with Group P (68.6% vs. 46.3%, p<0.01), and the number of doses per day was significantly lower in Group N (Mann-Whitney test, p=0.046), but the percentage of patients who reported problems with the regular intake of their medication did not differ significantly between groups (Group N vs. P: 47.0% vs. 40.0%). If patients noticed that they missed a dose, 45.3% completely skipped the missed dose (Group N vs. P: 43.0% vs. 48.1%, n.s.). In a multivariate analysis, significant risk factors of problems with regular drug intake were age<25yrs. (p<0.01) and patient-reported adverse effect of AED (p<0.01), followed by the number of AED doses per day (p<0.05), while gender, intake habits, usage of adherence aids, and patient-rated efficacy of AEDs were not significant.Patients treated by neurologists specialized in epileptology did not report less problems with adherence than patients surveyed in pharmacies. Since barriers for a regular intake are diverse, the use of a short questionnaire on management of drug intake may lead to an individually tailored counseling of patients to improve adherence.", "doi": "10.1016/j.yebeh.2017.11.039", "title": "Patients' perspectives on management and barriers of regular antiepileptic drug intake.", "journal": ["Epilepsy & behavior : E&B", "Epilepsy Behav"]}
