Medical College, Bikaner. The patients were subjected to detailed clinical history, thorough examination, Pediatric Symptom Checklist, and Bhatia's Battery of Performance intelligence Test. Data analysis was carried out with the help of SPSS 22 software.The prevalence of behavioral problems in generalized and partial seizure group was high (42% and 53.8%) as compared to control group (9%). Low IQ was present more in the patients (44%) of generalized and partial seizure group as compared with the control group, and results were statistically significant. Furthermore, behavioral problems were more in patients who were having more number of seizures (\u22653 per year) with significant P values (\u03c72 = 5.067, P = 0.024).We conclusively found that behavioral problems and cognitive factors, apart from control of seizures, must be kept in mind to determine how well a child with epilepsy progresses toward independence.", "doi": "10.4103/jnrp.jnrp_57_17", "title": "Behavioral Problems and Intelligence Quotient Changes in Pediatric Epilepsy: A Case-Control Study.", "journal": ["Journal of neurosciences in rural practice", "J Neurosci Rural Pract"]}
