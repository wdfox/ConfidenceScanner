Currently, there are no effective treatments to alleviate seizure frequency and high-voltage epileptic discharges in these catastrophic epilepsy cases. The current study examined the safety and feasibility of High-Definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) in reducing epileptiform activity in a 30-month-old child suffering from early onset epileptic encephalopathy.HD-tDCS was administered over 10 intervention days spanning two weeks including pre- and post-intervention video-EEG monitoring.There were no serious adverse events or side effects related to the HD-tDCS intervention. Frequency of clinical seizures was not significantly reduced. However, interictal sharp wave amplitudes were significantly lower during the post-intervention period versus baseline. Vital signs and blood biochemistry remained stable throughout the entire study.These exploratory findings support the safety and feasibility of 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01 HD-tDCS in early onset epileptic encephalopathy and provide the first evidence of HD-tDCS effects on paroxysmal EEG features in electroclinical cases under the age of 36\u00a0months. Extending HD-tDCS treatment may enhance electrographic findings and clinical effects.", "doi": "10.1080/02699052.2017.1390254", "title": "High-Definition transcranial direct current stimulation in early onset epileptic encephalopathy: a case study.", "journal": ["Brain injury", "Brain Inj"]}
