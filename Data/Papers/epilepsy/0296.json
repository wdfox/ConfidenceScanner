Behavior and cognition are negatively impacted by seizures, but AEDs are also a major contributor to behavioral and cognitive deficits. However, the cognitive and behavioral effect of AEDs in children is insufficiently emphasized in the literature. This review summarizes the cognitive and behavioral effects of AEDs in the pediatric population with the objective of helping pediatricians and pediatric neurologists to select the AEDs with the best profile for their individual patient's needs.", "doi": "10.1016/j.spen.2017.10.011", "title": "Cognitive and Behavioral Comorbidities: An Unwanted Effect of Antiepileptic Drugs in Children.", "journal": ["Seminars in pediatric neurology", "Semin Pediatr Neurol"]}
