Among the 23\u00a0deaths of indirect cause related to a preexisiting pathology, 22 (96\u00a0%) have been analyzed by the expert comity. A known or preexisting chronic disease was documented in 16\u00a0patients (sick-cell disorder, n=3, treated epilepsy, n=3, intracerebral carvenomas, n=1, multifocal glial tumor, n=1, breast cancer, n=1, systemic lupus, n=1, diabetes mellitus, n=3, antiphospholipid syndrome, n=1). For 6\u00a0women, the pathology was unknown before the pregnancy (glioblastoma, n=2, epilepsy, n=1, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, n=1, sick-cell disorder, n=1, breast cancer, n=1). While 6\u00a0of these deaths has been evaluated as not avoidable, 13\u00a0deaths has been considered as possibly (n=12) or certainly (n=1) preventable. The main factor of avoidability was the patient's interaction with the health system (medically non advised pregnancy, lack of adherence to treatment, for example). A pre-pregnancy medical consultation with a specialist should be recommended to all patients with preexisting chronic disease, to allow a complete information about the risks of a pregnancy, treatment adaptation if needed, better adherence and multidisciplinary follow up.", "doi": "10.1016/j.gofs.2017.10.018", "title": "[Indirect causes of maternal deaths (except stroke, cardiovascular diseases and infections): Results from the French confidential enquiry into maternal deaths, 2010-2012].", "journal": ["Gynecologie, obstetrique, fertilite & senologie", "Gynecol Obstet Fertil Senol"]}
