Out of adulthood epilepsies, mesio-temporal lobe epilepsy carries the highest cognitive and psychiatric risk, making mental health comorbidities its inherent features. The pathomechanism of the epilepsy-related mental health symptoms and conditions appears to be related to undetected subclinical seizures, postictal exhaustion and inhibition, and the non-REM sleep related interictal epileptic activity. In our work we try to present some of the typical psychiatric syndromes and conditions seen in epilepsy.
