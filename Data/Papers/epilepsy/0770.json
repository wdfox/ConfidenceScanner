However, it has been suggested that it could provide broad-spectrum efficacy given its similarity to levetiracetam and based on the results from preclinical studies and others of patients with generalized epilepsy. We present the case of a woman with refractory idiopathic generalized epilepsy and absence seizures with dramatic response to brivaracetam. Our report supports a consideration of treatment with this new antiepileptic drug on a case-by-case basis in patients with refractory generalized epilepsy, while we await further studies on this topic.", "doi": "10.1684/epd.2017.0939", "title": "Exceptional response to brivaracetam in a patient with refractory idiopathic generalized epilepsy and absence seizures.", "journal": ["Epileptic disorders : international epilepsy journal with videotape", "Epileptic Disord"]}
