Two unrelated children had mild developmental impairment and onset of myoclonic-absences at 3 and 8 years. Seizures were characterized by bilateral 3\u00a0Hz myoclonic jerks superimposed on tonic abduction of the upper limbs. Events lasted 10-60\u00a0s, and complex gestural automatisms were often observed; in one case, a boy undid his seatbelt and attempted to exit a moving vehicle. Post-ictally, both children immediately regained awareness without recollection of their actions. Ictal EEGs showed 3\u00a0Hz generalized spike-wave. Complex automatisms have not been described in myoclonic absence seizures. This generalized seizure type can be confused with focal seizures when these ictal behaviours occur.", "doi": "10.1016/j.ejpn.2017.12.003", "title": "Myoclonic absence seizures with complex gestural automatisms.", "journal": ["European journal of paediatric neurology : EJPN : official journal of the European Paediatric Neurology Society", "Eur.
