While it is always a challenge to learn a new classification system, particularly one that has remained essentially unchanged for over three decades, these new classifications allow for the inclusion of some previously unclassifiable seizure types and utilize more intuitive terminology. In this review, we specifically discuss the use of these new classifications for patients, clinicians, and researchers.", "doi": "10.1016/j.eplepsyres.2017.11.015", "title": "The new definition and classification of seizures and epilepsy.", "journal": ["Epilepsy research", "Epilepsy Res."]}
