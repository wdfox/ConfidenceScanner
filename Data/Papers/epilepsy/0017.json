A 76-year-old woman with chronic kidney disease developed ASE after neglecting peritoneal dialysis. Magnetic resonance imaging failed to demonstrate an appropriate lesion. Electroencephalography demonstrated ictal discharges in the left frontotemporal leads. ASE disappeared after intravenous valproic acid and correction of uremia. This is the first case report of ASE in a patient with acute aggravation of uremia.", "doi": "10.14581/jer.17018", "title": "Aphasic Status Epilepticus Associated with Uremia.", "journal": ["Journal of epilepsy research", "J Epilepsy Res"]}
