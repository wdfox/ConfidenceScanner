We review here clinical overlaps between seizures and migraine attacks, activities of neuronal networks observed during seizures and migraine attacks, and molecular and cellular mechanisms of migraine identified in genetic forms, focusing on genetic variants identified in hemiplegic migraine and their functional effects. Epilepsy and migraine can be generated by dysfunctions of the same neuronal networks, but these dysfunctions can be disease-specific, even if pathogenic mutations target the same protein. Studies of rare monogenic forms have allowed the identification of some molecular/cellular dysfunctions that provide a window on pathological mechanisms: we have begun to disclose the tip of the iceberg.", "doi": "10.1016/j.neulet.2017.11.025", "title": "Pathophysiological mechanisms of migraine and epilepsy: Similarities and differences.", "journal": ["Neuroscience letters", "Neurosci.
