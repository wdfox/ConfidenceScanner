Increasingly, human mutations in synapse genes are being identified across these disorders. These neurodevelopmental synaptopathies highlight synaptic homeostasis pathways as a convergence point underlying disease mechanisms. Here, we review some of the key pre- and postsynaptic genes in which penetrant human mutations have been identified in neurodevelopmental disorders for which genetic rodent models have been generated. Specifically, we focus on the main behavioural phenotypes that have been documented in these animal models, to consolidate our current understanding of how synapse genes regulate key behavioural and cognitive domains. These studies provide insights into better understanding the basis of the overlapping genetic and cognitive heterogeneity observed in neurodevelopmental disorders.", "doi": "10.1016/j.pnpbp.2017.12.001", "title": "Neurodevelopmental synaptopathies: Insights from behaviour in rodent models of synapse gene mutations.", "journal": ["Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry", "Prog.
