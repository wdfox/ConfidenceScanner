Since this procedure was first used to treat MTLE in 2010, the literature contains reports of 37 patients that underwent MR-guided stereotactic laser amygdalohippocampotomy (SLAH) using Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy (LITT) with at least 1year of follow-up. This early body of data suggests that SLAH is a safe and effective treatment for MTLE in properly selected patients. Moreover, SLAH is substantially less invasive when compared with open surgical procedures including standard anterior temporal lobectomy and its more selective variants, results in immediate destruction of tissue in contrast to radiosurgical treatments for MTLE, and can more readily ablate larger volumes of tissue than is possible with techniques employing radiofrequency ablation. Finally, evidence is accruing that SLAH is associated with lower overall risk of neuropsychological deficits compared to open surgery. Thus, LITT constitutes a novel minimally invasive tool in the neurosurgeon's armamentarium for managing medically refractory seizures that may draw eligible patients to consider surgical interventions to manage their seizures.", "doi": "10.1016/j.eplepsyres.2017.10.015", "title": "A neurosurgeon`s view: Laser interstitial thermal therapy of mesial temporal lobe structures.", "journal": ["Epilepsy research", "Epilepsy Res."]}
