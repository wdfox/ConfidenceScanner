The disease's incidence is around 1/40 000 to 1/60 000 births in the general population. A 32-year-old man, born out of non-consanguineous union, presented with generalised tonic-clonic seizures and myoclonus since 17 years of age. Seizures were noted to be resistant to multiple epileptic drugs. He developed gait imbalance, intentional tremor and dysarthria. Detailed examination revealed hepatosplenomegaly, bilateral pancerebellar signs with normal power, reflexes and sensory system. He had major cognitive impairment with impaired frontal and temporal lobar functions. Bone marrow evaluation revealed Gaucher cells, confirming the diagnosis.", "doi": "10.1136/bcr-2017-222304", "title": "Progressive myoclonic epilepsy and horizontal gaze palsy: a rare aetiology.", "journal": ["BMJ case reports", "BMJ Case Rep"]}
