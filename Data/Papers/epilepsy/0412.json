The presence of early posthypoxic myoclonus (PHM) following cardiac arrest had been invariably associated with poor outcome, but more recent studies have shown that those with early PHM may survive with good neurological function. Electroencephalographic patterns suggestive of severe brain injury may be more valuable than the presence of PHM itself in portending poor functional status, and phenotyping PHM may also be useful in delineating benign and malignant forms. Patients with early PHM should be evaluated similarly to others who suffer cardiac arrest by using a multimodal approach in determining prognosis until further studies are performed that better characterize early PHM subtypes and their outcomes.", "doi": "10.5698/1535-7597.17.5.265", "title": "Myoclonus After Cardiac Arrest: Where Do We Go From Here?", "journal": ["Epilepsy currents", "Epilepsy Curr"]}
