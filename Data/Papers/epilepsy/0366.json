The chromatographic separation was performed on a Kinetex PFP (100 \u00d7 2.6\u00a0mm, 4.6\u00a0\u00b5m) column, using a mobile phase of sodium acetate 0.03\u00a0M\u00a0pH 3.7 and acetonitrile (40/60, v/v), at a flow rate of 0.8\u00a0mL/min. Total chromatography time for each run was 5\u00a0min. Sample preparation (250\u00a0\u00b5L) involved only one simple precipitation step by acetonitrile spiked with mirtazapine as internal standard. The method was validated over a concentration range of 20-1000\u00a0ng/mL and successfully applied to measure perampanel concentrations in plasma samples obtained from patients with epilepsy. This assay combines the high specificity of fluorescence detection with a very simple and fast sample pretreatment and can offer real advantages over existing methods in terms of simplicity and transferability to a therapeutic drug monitoring setting.", "doi": "10.1016/j.plabm.2017.11.003", "title": "Simple and rapid validated HPLC-fluorescence determination of perampanel in the plasma of patients with epilepsy.", "journal": ["Practical laboratory medicine", "Pract Lab Med"]}
