In addition to epilepsy, it is also used for treating anxiety disorders and dystonia as well as tardive dyskinesia associated with the use of levodopa and neuroleptic drugs. Phenytoin therapy in a 10-year-old boy with convulsions was discontinued following cardiac rhythm impairment. The patient was then started on levetiracetam. However, visual and auditory hallucinations were observed on the 1st day of levetiracetam therapy. Levetiracetam was discontinued and replaced with sodium valproate, and the hallucinations resolved. The purpose of this report was to remind physicians that hallucinations are one of the rare complications of levetiracetam.", "doi": "10.14744/nci.2017.44366", "title": "Hallucination: A rare complication of levetiracetam theraphy.", "journal": ["Northern clinics of Istanbul", "North Clin Istanb"]}
