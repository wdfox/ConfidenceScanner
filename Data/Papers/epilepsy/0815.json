This disorder is characterised by amelogenesis imperfecta, as well as severe neurological symptoms including epilepsy and psychomotor delay. However, little is known about the protein encoded by Rogdi, and hence the pathogenic mechanisms underlying Kohlsch\u00fctter-T\u00f6nz syndrome have remained elusive. Using immunofluorescence of rat cultured hippocampal neurons and brain sections we find that Rogdi is enriched at synaptic sites. In addition, recombinant GFP-Rogdi expressed in cultured neurons was efficiently targeted to presynaptic sites, where it colocalised with the presynaptic scaffolding protein Bassoon and the synaptic vesicle markers Synaptophysin, Synapsin-1, VAMP2/Synaptobrevin and Mover. Our data indicate that GFP-Rogdi harbours efficient signals for presynaptic targeting, and that Rogdi is a presynaptic protein. Thus, the neurological symptoms associated with Kohlsch\u00fctter-T\u00f6nz syndrome may arise from presynaptic dysfunction.", "doi": "10.1038/s41598-017-16004-1", "title": "The Kohlsch\u00fctter-T\u00f6nz syndrome associated gene Rogdi encodes a novel presynaptic protein.", "journal": ["Scientific reports", "Sci Rep"]}
