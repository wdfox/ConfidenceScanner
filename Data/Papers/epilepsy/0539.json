Oxidative stress markers such as Nitric Oxide (NO), Malondialdehyde (MDA) and antioxidant enzyme activities namely Superoxide Dismutase (SOD), Glutathione Peroxidase (GPx) and Catalase (CAT) were measured spectrophotometrically.Significantly higher levels of serum NO, MDA and low levels of plasma Total Antioxidant Capacity (TAC) were found in patients as compared to controls (p<0.001) whereas erythrocyte SOD, CAT and GPx activities were found to be significantly low in patients when compared to the control group (p<0.001). Statistically significant higher levels of NO, MDA and lower levels of SOD, CAT and TAC were observed in patients subgroup, who were on AEDs for more than >5 years compared to other groups (\u2264 1 year and 1-\u2264 5 years) (p=0.02, p=0.01, p=0.001, p=0.01 and p=0.05 respectively). Further, significant increase in the levels of NO, MDA and decreased activities of SOD, CAT were found in treated patients compared to untreated patients (p<0.05) denoting that additional oxidative stress induced by AEDs which results in seizure recurrence and drug intractability.Our study demonstrated that GGE patients have additional oxidative stress due to AEDs and decreased antioxidant enzyme activities causing an imbalance between oxidant and antioxidant status, which might contribute to the pathogenesis of GGE.", "doi": "10.7860/JCDR/2017/29133.10604", "title": "Oxidative Stress in the Development of Genetic Generalised Epilepsy: An Observational Study in Southern Indian Population.", "journal": ["Journal of clinical and diagnostic research : JCDR", "J Clin Diagn Res"]}
