We recently identified a novel BS locus, julius seizure (jus), encoding a protein containing two transmembrane domains and an extracellular cysteine-rich loop. We also determined that jussda iso7.8, a previously identified BS mutation, is an allele of jus by recombination, deficiency mapping, complementation testing, and genetic rescue. RNAi knockdown revealed that jus expression is important in cholinergic neurons and that the critical stage of jus expression is the mid-pupa. Finally, we found that a functional, GFP-tagged genomic construct of jus is expressed mostly in axons of the neck connectives and of the thoracic abdominal ganglia. In this Extra View article, we show that a MiMiC GFP-tagged Jus is localized to the same nervous system regions as the GFP-tagged genomic construct, but its expression is mostly confined to cell bodies and it causes bang-sensitivity. The MiMiC GFP-tag lies in the extracellular loop while the genomic construct is tagged at the C-terminus. This suggests that the alternate position of the GFP tag may disrupt Jus protein function by altering its subcellular localization and/or stability. We also show that a small subset of jus-expressing neurons are responsible for the BS phenotype. Finally, extending the utility of the BS seizure model, we show that jus mutants exhibit cold-sensitive paralysis and are partially sensitive to strobe-induced seizures.", "doi": "10.1080/19336934.2017.1402993", "title": "Extending julius seizure, a bang-sensitive gene, as a model for studying epileptogenesis: Cold shock, and a new insertional mutation.", "journal": ["Fly", "Fly (Austin)"]}
