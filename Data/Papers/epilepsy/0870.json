Between 2010 and 2012, 23 maternal deaths were considered as unexplained sudden deaths and three of them were not evaluated due to a lack of clinical data. In addition, 13 maternal deaths with an identified cause occurred in a clinical context of sudden death (7 cases of pulmonary embolism, 2 cases of epilepsy, and 2 cases of cardiomyopathy). The first maneuvers of resuscitation in the presence of bystanders were attempted in 8 of 22 cases (36%). This emphasizes the importance of teaching the non-medical resuscitation modalities of cardiac arrest in pregnant women. Pregnant women must receive accurate resuscitation as the whole population. An autopsy was performed in 10 of 33 cases (30%) and was considered incomplete in 3 patients. This result emphasizes the necessity to perform a systematic and specialized autopsy in the context of sudden maternal death, which is mostly unexplained.", "doi": "10.1016/j.gofs.2017.10.020", "title": "[Maternal deaths due to sudden death.
