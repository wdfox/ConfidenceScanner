Herein, we report a case of a 40-year-old woman who developed refractory temporal lobe epilepsy; one year after recovery form Natalizumab-induced PML. Localisation related epilepsy, which may be refractory in nature, as in this case report, is a potential chronic disabling complication of PML. Epilepsy in this context, likely reflects grey matter involvement, which may then act as cortical epileptogenic zone.", "doi": "10.1016/j.msard.2017.12.004", "title": "Refractory epilepsy following natalizumab associated PML.", "journal": ["Multiple sclerosis and related disorders", "Mult Scler Relat Disord"]}
