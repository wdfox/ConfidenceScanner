DDX59 encodes a DEAD-box RNA helicase and its role in brain function and neurological diseases is unclear. We showed a reduction of mutant cDNA and perturbation of SHH signaling from patient-derived cell lines; furthermore, analysis of human brain gene expression provides evidence that DDX59 is enriched in oligodendrocytes and might act within pathways of leukoencephalopathies-associated genes. We also characterized the neuronal phenotype of the Drosophila model using mutant mahe, the homolog of human DDX59, and showed that mahe loss-of-function mutant embryos exhibit impaired development of peripheral and central nervous system. Taken together, our results support a conserved role of this DEAD-box RNA helicase in neurological function.", "doi": "10.1002/humu.23368", "title": "A loss-of-function homozygous mutation in DDX59 implicates a conserved DEAD-box RNA helicase in nervous system development and function.", "journal": ["Human mutation", "Hum.
