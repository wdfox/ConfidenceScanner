Quinidine, a potassium channel blocker, has been proposed as a potential therapeutic agent with only a few patients reported in the literature to have received it. Here we report 3 additional children, with such KCNT1 mutations and refractory seizures, who received quinidine therapy.Retrospective chart review of 3 children with KCNT1 mutations, of ages 3\u202fmonths, 9\u202fyears and 13\u202fyears old. Video-EEG documented seizure type and frequency. Seizure frequency was compared before and after quinidine initiation. We then analyzed seizure response (defined as \u202f>\u202f50% reduction in seizure frequency) as it related to age in our 3 reported children, an additional 2 previously seen by us in our center, and an additional 3 reported in the literature (total 8 cases).In our report, the 3-month-old infant responded to quinidine, while the two older children did not. Using a cutoff of 4\u202fyears of age, review of the total of 8 cases, five from our center, revealed that all patients younger than 4\u202fyears responded to quinidine (4/4), while none of the ones older than 4\u202fyears did (0/4).The above-mentioned findings support performance of prospective controlled studies of quinidine efficacy in children with KCNT1 gain-of-function mutations that control for age as a possible variable affecting response.", "doi": "10.1016/j.seizure.2017.11.017", "title": "Does age affect response to quinidine in patients with KCNT1 mutations?
