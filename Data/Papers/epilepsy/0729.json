The resulting GAG accumulation in cells and tissues throughout the body leads to progressive multi-organ dysfunction. MPS patients present with several somatic manifestations, including short stature, musculoskeletal abnormalities, and cardiorespiratory dysfunction, and several primary and secondary neurological signs and symptoms. Epileptic seizures are neurological signs of MPS thought to develop due to accumulation of GAGs in the brain, triggering alterations in neuronal connectivity and signaling, and release of inflammatory mediators. The amount of literature on the prevalence, pathophysiology, clinical features, and management of epileptic seizures in patients with MPS is limited. This review discusses current knowledge on this topic, as well as two case examples, presented and discussed during a closed meeting on MPS and the brain among an international group of experts with extensive experience in managing and treating MPS.", "doi": "10.1016/j.ymgme.2017.10.006", "title": "Epilepsy in mucopolysaccharidosis disorders.", "journal": ["Molecular genetics and metabolism", "Mol.
