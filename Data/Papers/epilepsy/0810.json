We herein report a patient with lung metastasis of ACC who achieved a favorable response to levetiracetam. A 52-year-old Japanese man was admitted to our hospital because of multiple lung metastases of ACC. We performed first-line chemotherapy with cisplatin plus gemcitabine, and subsequently oral S-1 as second-line chemotherapy, which resulted in disease progression. The patient developed symptomatic epilepsy and received levetiracetam (250 mg twice daily). At five months after the initiation of levetiracetam, chest computed tomography showed regression of the metastatic lung lesions.", "doi": "10.2169/internalmedicine.9300-17", "title": "A Favorable Response to Levetiracetam in a Patient with Metastatic Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma.", "journal": ["Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)", "Intern.
