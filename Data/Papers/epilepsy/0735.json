It is important particularly for physicians and other healthcare providers in primary care settings to evaluate these patients properly. Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the most common cause of death from non-communicable diseases worldwide and are characterized by a high level of comorbidities.To address the distribution of CVDs and comorbidities across sociodemographic groups and associations between CVDs and comorbidities.A cross-sectional study was conducted using data of 67\u2009786 patients. Data were collected by the Registration Network Family Practices (RegistratieNet Huisartspraktijken, RNH). Comorbidities were analysed using chi-square and logistic regression analyses.At the time of study, 26.5% of the patients had at least one CVD and 10.5% of patients had two or more CVD diagnoses. The strongest association within cardiovascular diseases were between health failure and arrhythmias (OR: 9.20; 95%CI: 7.78-10.89). Coronary artery disease and hypertension had strong relationship with diabetes (OR: 2.22; 95%CI: 2.02-2.45, OR: 2.22; 95%CI: 2.02-2.45 respectively) and lipid metabolism disorders (OR: 2.04; 95%CI: 1.87-2.23, OR: 2.04; 95%CI: 1.87-2.23, respectively). The strongest associations for cerebrovascular diseases were with epilepsy (OR: 4.09; 95%CI: 3.29-5.10) and arrhythmias (OR: 2.23; 95%CI: 1.99-2.50).One out of every four patients suffered from at least one CVD. Having one CVD increased the risk of another, co-occurring CVD and a higher number of other chronic diseases.", "doi": "10.1080/13814788.2017.1398318", "title": "Cardiovascular disease patients have increased risk for comorbidity: A cross-sectional study in the Netherlands.", "journal": ["The European journal of general practice", "Eur J Gen Pract"]}
