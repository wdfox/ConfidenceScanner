There is a still significant need to develop novel anticonvulsant drugs that possess superior efficacy, broad spectrum of activities and good safety profile.\u03b1-Asaronol and two current antiseizure drugs (\u03b1-asarone and carbamazepine (CBZ)) were assessed by in vivo anticonvulsant screening with the three most employed standard animal seizure models, including maximal electroshock seizure (MES), subcutaneous injection-pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures and 3-mercaptopropionic acid (3-MP)-induced seizures in mice. Considering drug safety evaluation, acute neurotoxicity was assessed with minimal motor impairment screening determined in the rotarod test, and acute toxicity was also detected in mice.In our results, \u03b1-asaronol displayed a broad spectrum of anticonvulsant activity (ACA) and showed better protective indexes (PI\u202f=\u202f11.11 in MES, PI\u202f=\u202f8.68 in PTZ) and lower acute toxicity (LD50\u202f=\u202f2940\u202fmg/kg) than its metabolic parent compound (\u03b1-asarone). Additionally, \u03b1-asaronol displayed a prominent anticonvulsant profile with ED50 values of 62.02\u202fmg/kg in the MES and 79.45\u202fmg/kg in the sc-PTZ screen as compared with stiripentol of ED50 of 240\u202fmg/kg and 115\u202fmg/kg in the relevant test, respectively.The results of the present study revealed \u03b1-asaronol can be developed as a novel molecular in the search for safer and efficient anticonvulsants having neuroprotective effects as well as low toxicity. Meanwhile, the results also suggested that \u03b1-asaronol has great potential to develop into another new aromatic allylic alcohols type anticonvulsant drug for add-on therapy of Dravet's syndrome.", "doi": "10.1016/j.pharep.2017.08.004", "title": "Anticonvulsant activities of \u03b1-asaronol ((E)-3'-hydroxyasarone), an active constituent derived from \u03b1-asarone.", "journal": ["Pharmacological reports : PR", "Pharmacol Rep"]}
