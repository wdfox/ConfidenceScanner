The advantages of ECoG-based language mapping over the gold-standard stimulation include: (i) lack of stimulation-induced seizures, (ii) better sensitivity of localization of language areas in young children, and (iii) shorter patient participant time. Despite its potential utility, ECoG-based language mapping is far less commonly practiced than stimulation mapping. Here, we have provided video presentations to explain, point-by-point, our own hardware setting and time-frequency analysis procedures. We also have provided standardized auditory stimuli, in multiple languages, ready to be used for ECoG-based language mapping. Finally, we discussed the technical aspects of ECoG-based mapping, including its pitfalls, to facilitate appropriate interpretation of the data.", "doi": "10.1016/j.clinph.2017.10.018", "title": "Presurgical language mapping using event-related high-gamma activity: The Detroit procedure.", "journal": ["Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "Clin Neurophysiol"]}
