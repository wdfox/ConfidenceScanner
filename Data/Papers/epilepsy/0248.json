Identification of clonally expanded T-cell clones (TCCs) was achieved by combining flow cytometry sorting of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and high-throughput TCR V\u03b2-chain sequencing. The most abundant brain-infiltrating TCCs were isolated and functionally characterized.We found that CD4+, CD8+, and also \u03b3\u03b4 T cells infiltrate the brain tissue in RE. Further analysis surprisingly revealed that not only brain-infiltrating CD8+ but also CD4+ T cells are clonally expanded in RE. All 3 subsets exhibited a Tc1/Th1 phenotype characterized by the production of interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 and TNF. Broad cytokine profiling at the clonal level showed strong production of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF and also secretion of interleukin (IL)-5, IL-13, and granzyme B, both in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.CD8+ T cells were until now considered the central players in the immunopathogenesis of RE. Our study adds to previous findings and highlights that CD4+ TCCs and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells that secrete IFN-\u03b3 and TNF are also involved. These findings underline the complexity of T-cell immunity in RE and suggest a specific role for CD4+ T cells in orchestrating the CD8+ T-cell effector immune response.", "doi": "10.1212/NXI.0000000000000419", "title": "Phenotypic and functional complexity of brain-infiltrating T cells in Rasmussen encephalitis.", "journal": ["Neurology(R) neuroimmunology & neuroinflammation", "Neurol Neuroimmunol Neuroinflamm"]}
