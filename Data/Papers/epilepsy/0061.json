The PSG data in the two diagnostic groups were compared, and the PSG parameters associated with the degree of impairment were analysed.In 19/49 UWS/VS patients, signal attenuation was the only EEG pattern detectable in sleep. Non-REM 2 (NREM2) and slow-wave sleep (SWS) (but not REM) stages were more frequent in the MCS patients. The presence of SWS was the most appropriate factor for classifying patients as UWS/VS or MCS, and the duration of SWS was the main factor that significantly correlated with revised Coma Recovery Scale scores.The presence of NREM sleep (namely SWS) reflects better preservation of the circuitry and structures needed to sustain this stage of sleep in DOC patients.PSG is a simple and effective technique, and sleep patterns may reflect the degree of impairment in chronic DOC patients.", "doi": "10.1016/j.clinph.2017.12.012", "title": "Sleep patterns associated with the severity of impairment in a large cohort of patients with chronic disorders of consciousness.", "journal": ["Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "Clin Neurophysiol"]}
