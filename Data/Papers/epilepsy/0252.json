However, other manifestations such as epileptic seizures, abnormal movements, and memory or language complications are not unusual. Here, we report the case of a young man who presented with a new-onset epilepsy, with ictal semiology suggestive of insular involvement; this hypothesis was supported by a PET-CT study. Anti-NMDAR antibodies were found in the CSF, confirming the diagnosis of anti-NMDAR encephalitis. A review of the literature reveals that epilepsy can be the first manifestation of NMDAR encephalitis, with a clear male predominance. Despite its rarity, neurologists should consider this diagnosis for any young patient developing a new-onset epilepsy with temporal or insular features, particularly if the patient is male. Other cognitive or behavioural signs, even very subtle, should also prompt diagnosis.", "doi": "10.1684/epd.2017.0945", "title": "A case of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis revealed by insular epilepsy.", "journal": ["Epileptic disorders : international epilepsy journal with videotape", "Epileptic Disord"]}
