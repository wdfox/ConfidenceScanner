Eligible patients were non-institutionalized children with epilepsy aged 3-16 years who had experienced \u22651 PACS in the past year and had \u22651 currently prescribed PACS rescue medication. Investigators provided clinical assessments and parents/guardians completed questionnaires. Statistical tests were post hoc; p values are descriptive.At enrollment (N\u00a0=\u00a0286), most patients had prescriptions for diazepam (69.2%) and/or midazolam (55.9%); some had two (26.6%) or three (2.4%) prescribed rescue medications. Most patients experienced PACS despite regular anti-epilepsy medication. According to parents, the average duration of their child's seizures without rescue medication was <5\u00a0min in 35.7% of patients, 5-<20\u00a0min in 42.6%, and \u226520\u00a0min in 21.7% (n\u00a0=\u00a0258); with\u00a0rescue medication seizure duration was <5\u00a0min in 69.4% of patients, 5-<20\u00a0min in 25.6%, and \u226520\u00a0min in 5.0%. Rescue medication use was significantly associated with average seizures lasting <5\u00a0min (\u03c72\u00a0=\u00a058.8; p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). At the time of their most recent PACS, 58.5-67.8% of children reportedly received rescue medication within 5\u00a0min of seizure onset, and 85.4-94.1% within 10\u00a0min.This study provides the first real-world data that rescue medications administered in the community reduce the duration of PACS in children with epilepsy.
