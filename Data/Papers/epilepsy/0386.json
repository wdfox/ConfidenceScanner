Cognitive dysfunction induced by seizures is one of the severe comorbidities of epilepsy and epileptic syndrome, which has a negative impact on epileptic patients' quality of life. Several mechanisms may be associated with cognitive impairment in patients with epilepsy. Here, we review how the dynamic functional alterations of brain network influence seizure-related cognitive outcomes.", "doi": "10.1016/j.eplepsyres.2017.12.005", "title": "Dynamic functional disturbances of brain network in seizure-related cognitive outcomes.", "journal": ["Epilepsy research", "Epilepsy Res."]}
