Monitoring the brain activities and identifying the seizure source which starts with spike detection are important steps for epilepsy treatment. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is an emerging epileptic diagnostic tool with high-density sensors; this makes manual analysis a challenging task due to the vast amount of MEG data. This paper explores the use of eight statistical features and genetic programing (GP) with the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) for interictal spike detection. The proposed method is comprised of three stages: preprocessing, genetic programming-based feature generation, and classification. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been evaluated using real MEG data obtained from 28 epileptic patients. It has achieved a 91.75% average sensitivity and 92.99% average specificity.", "doi": "10.1155/2017/3035606", "title": "Epileptic MEG Spike Detection Using Statistical Features and Genetic Programming with KNN.", "journal": ["Journal of healthcare engineering", "J Healthc Eng"]}
