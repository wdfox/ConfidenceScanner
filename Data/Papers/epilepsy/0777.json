Though sometimes associated with drug-resistant epilepsy, this association has not been well studied. We report six SOD patients with associated malformation of cortical development (MCD) and drug-resistant epilepsy who underwent video-EEG telemetry at our centre between 1998 and 2016 for drug-resistant epilepsy. \u202cThree then underwent surgery; right temporal neocortical resection, right functional hemispherectomy and placement of a vagus nerve stimulator.
