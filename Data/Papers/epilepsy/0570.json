Anterior shoulder dislocation is one such orthopedic injury that is quite rare. The shoulder dislocation may injure the brachial plexus. Besides seizures, the nerves can also be damaged by anticonvulsive therapy. Muscle wasting following a seizure can misguide a clinician to investigate only neural or muscular pathologies. We report here an individual with epilepsy who was referred to us for electrodiagnostic evaluation of proximal muscle wasting related to a suspected proximal neuropathy. He was found to have a normal electrodiagnostic evaluation and later on discovered to have had bilateral shoulder dislocation on X-rays. This report advocates a thorough clinical appraisal, radiographs, and electrodiagnostic evaluation in a case with muscle wasting following a seizure.", "doi": "10.1016/j.cjtee.2017.06.003", "title": "Bilateral spontaneous anterior shoulder dislocation: A missed orthopedic injury mistaken as proximal neuropathy.", "journal": ["Chinese journal of traumatology = Zhonghua chuang shang za zhi", "Chin.
