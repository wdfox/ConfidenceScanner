As we struggle to keep up with the literature and concentrate on our own research and clinical work, we often fail to exercise our imagination and envision what our field will be like in future decades. This was the assignment to the speakers for the Presidential Symposium at the 2016 American Epilepsy Society Annual Meeting. I challenged the experts to step outside the frame of their usual daily work to imagine what epilepsy treatment would and should look like for the next generation of epilepsy specialists and their patients. As you will read in the following sections, the speakers truly stepped up to the challenge to look into the crystal ball. The following are summaries of each lecture that describe the current state, existing cutting edge ideas, and some surprising predictions for the future. I am grateful for the tremendous effort these experts put into this challenge and hope they stimulate your imagination so you will work to bring these advances to our patients.", "doi": "10.5698/1535-7597.17.4.204", "title": "Epilepsy Treatment: A Futurist View.", "journal": ["Epilepsy currents", "Epilepsy Curr"]}
