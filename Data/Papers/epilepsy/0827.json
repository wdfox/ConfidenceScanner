Mutations have been identified in three genes: KRIT1, MGC4607 and PDCD10. We have documented a novel mutation on KRIT1 gene, and the second to be reported in a Portuguese family. This mutation consists in a two nucleotide insertion (c.947_948insAC) within the exon 10, resulting in premature protein termination (p.Leu317Argfs*2). These findings will hopefully contribute to a better clinical, imaging and genetic characterisation of this disease, particularly while trying to identify the factors that influence its treatment and prognosis.", "doi": "10.1016/j.seizure.2017.10.020", "title": "Familial cerebral cavernous malformation: Report of a novel KRIT1 mutation in a Portuguese family.", "journal": ["Seizure", "Seizure"]}
