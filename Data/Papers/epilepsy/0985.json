Patients with these lesions usually present with refractory seizures and inconclusive imaging findings that may be confused with other more common diagnoses such as dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors or low-grade gliomas. Therefore, surgical resection is warranted to reach a pathologic diagnosis and seizure control. To the best of our knowledge, only 16 cases have been published in the English literature.We present the case of a 52-year-old male who presented at our institution with a 2-year-history of absence of seizures. Brain MRI showed a T2-hyperintense lesion with no contrast enhancement affecting his temporal lobe. Temporal craniotomy and microsurgical resection was scheduled. The procedure was uneventful and a grayish, gluey mass was sent for pathologic analysis. The tumor was formed by immature neuronal cells organized in nodules with a vacuolated matrix. A thorough immunohistochemical analysis showed positivity for: Protein Gene Product 9.5. ATRX. OLIG2. SOX10. p16. Nestin. Synaptophysin. The findings were consistent with multinodular and vacuolating neuronal tumor. The patient has been seizure-free after surgery and with no signs of tumor progression.We present a thorough review addressing this uncommon tumor along with a description of the 17th reported case of MVNT, a tumor that was described for the first time in 2013. Further studies and case studies are necessary to establish a well-defined morphological and immunohistochemical profile along with knowledge about its natural history.", "doi": "10.1016/j.neucir.2017.08.003", "title": "Multinodular and vacuolating neuronal tumor of the cerebrum.
