In most cases, the diagnosis of sleep apnea is straightforward with patients having symptoms of snoring, choking\u00a0or gasping for air while asleep and witnessed apneas. However, sleep apnea is known to present in some unusual ways. We present a case of a 61-year-old male, with recently diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea (currently not on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)) and a history of seizure-like events since the age of 18 years, who came to the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) for spell characterization of his frequent seizure-like episodes. A continuous video electroencephalogram (vEEG) performed in order to determine the semiology of these spells showed that all the spells were triggered by an arousal from sleep with an associated apneic event. He was started on positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy, which resulted in the gradual decline in the number as well as the severity of his seizure-like spells. Based on the observations from vEEG monitoring and the patient's response, we concluded these seizure-like events as non-epileptic spells, triggered by apnea-related arousals in the context of OSA.", "doi": "10.7759/cureus.1800", "title": "Obstructive Sleep Apnea Presenting as Non-epileptic Spells: A Unique Combination.", "journal": ["Cureus", "Cureus"]}
