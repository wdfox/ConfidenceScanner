Stimulation induced P\u2011glycoprotein (gp) and multidrug resistance\u2011associated protein (MRP0) 1 expression, which peaked by 24\u00a0h. Interestingly, the expression of P\u2011gp and Mrp1 correlated with cell proliferation. Therefore, reactivation of astrocytes may increase P\u2011gp and Mrp1 expression through TNF\u2011\u03b1 and nuclear factor (NF)\u2011\u03baB signaling. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the present study is the first to demonstrate that in\u00a0vitro activated astrocytes likely induced P\u2011gp and Mrp1 expression by increasing NF\u2011\u03baB expression. The results of the present study provide a novel insight into the mechanism of refractory epilepsy and suggest inhibiting cytokine signaling may block multidrug resistance.", "doi": "10.3892/mmr.2017.7939", "title": "Reactive astrocytes increase the expression of P\u2011gp and Mrp1 via TNF\u2011\u03b1 and NF\u2011\u03baB signaling.", "journal": ["Molecular medicine reports", "Mol Med Rep"]}
