The clinical features of this entity evolve over time and the specific CP syndrome may be recognizable only after 3-5 y of age; although suggestive signs and symptoms may be present at an earlier age. The management involves neurological rehabilitation (addressing muscle tonal abnormalities, and devising physical and occupational therapies) and diagnosis and management of co-morbidities (including epilepsy, impairment of cognition, vision, hearing, and disturbances of growth and gastrointestinal function). The management, therefore, is multidisciplinary involving the treating physician working with a team of rehabilitation-, orthopedic-, psychologic-, and social care- providers.", "doi": "10.1007/s12098-017-2475-1", "title": "Cerebral Palsy: An Overview.", "journal": ["Indian journal of pediatrics", "Indian J Pediatr"]}
