It is typically characterized by subcortical, predominantly parieto-occipital, vasogenic brain oedema in patients with acute-subacute neurological symptoms. Infratentorial oedema on neuroimaging has been mostly described in association with the typical supratentorial pattern and seldom as isolated.We report a case of PRES with isolated pons involvement on MRI. A woman affected by Turner syndrome, epilepsy, slight mental deficiency, obesity and hypothyroidism, experienced a progressive gait and standing impairment, worsening in the last 2\u00a0weeks. At admission blood pressure was 220/110\u00a0mmHg. Brain MRI showed a wide FLAIR signal hyperintensity on T2-weighted sequences affecting the entire pons, without contrast enhancement. Clonidine, doxazosine, furosemide and telmisartan were effective in restoring normal blood pressure. Pons hyperintensity completely resolved on MRI 3\u00a0weeks later, together with return to normal neurological examination.Though isolated infratentorial involvement in PRES recognizes several causes, hypertension, which is a common feature in Turner syndrome, would have played a key role in our case with solely pons MRI T2-hyperintensity.", "doi": "10.1016/j.ensci.2016.11.008", "title": "Isolated pons involvement in Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome: Case report and review of the literature.", "journal": ["eNeurologicalSci", "eNeurologicalSci"]}
