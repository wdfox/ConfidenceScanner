Proponents of next-generation genetic sequencing have argued that replacing these screening panels with whole exome sequencing (WES) would save money. Here, we present a complex patient in whom WES allowed diagnosis of GM1 gangliosidosis, caused by homozygous GLB1 mutations, resulting in \u03b2-galactosidase deficiency. A 10-year-old girl had progressive neurologic deterioration, macular cherry-red spot, and cornea verticillata. She had marked clinical improvement with initiation of the ketogenic diet. Comparative genomic hybridization microarray showed mosaic chromosome 3 paternal uniparental disomy (UPD). GM1 gangliosidosis was suspected, however \u03b2-galactosidase assay was normal. Trio WES identified a paternally-inherited pathogenic splice-site GLB1 mutation (c.75+2dupT). The girl had GM1 gangliosidosis; however, enzymatic testing in blood was normal, presumably compensated for by non-UPD cells. Severe neurologic dysfunction occurred due to disruptive effects of UPD brain cells.", "doi": "10.1002/ajmg.a.38549", "title": "Mosaic uniparental disomy results in GM1 gangliosidosis with normal enzyme assay.", "journal": ["American journal of medical genetics.
