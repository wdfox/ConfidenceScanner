The aim of this study was to determine whether FS in early childhood are over-represented in young adults dying from sudden cardiac death (SCD).We included all deaths (n\u2009=\u20094595) nationwide and through review of all death certificates, we identified 245 SCD in Danes aged 1-30\u2009years in 2000-09. Through the usage of nationwide registries, we identified all persons admitted with first FS among SCD cases (14/245; 5.7%) and in the corresponding living Danish population (71\u00a0027/2\u00a0369\u00a0785; 3.0%) and also in victims of transport accidents (26/917; 2.8%). The frequency of FS among SCD cases was significantly increased by an odds ratio of 1.96 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14-3.36; P\u2009=\u20090.021] compared with the living Danish population and with an odds ratio of 2.08 (95% CI 1.07-4.04; P\u2009=\u20090.046) compared with transport accident victims. SCD cases did not differ statistically in birth year (P\u2009=\u20090.272), age at SCD (P\u2009=\u20090.667) or prior medical conditions, except for epilepsy (P\u2009<\u20090.001), when comparing SCD with and without prior FS. The most common cause of death in autopsied SCD cases with FS was sudden arrhythmic death syndrome (5/8; 62.5%).In conclusion, this study demonstrates a significantly two-fold increase in the frequency of FS prior to death in young SCD cases compared with the two control groups, suggesting that FS could potentially contribute in a risk stratification model for SCD and warrant further studies.", "doi": "10.1093/europace/eux335", "title": "Febrile seizures prior to sudden cardiac death: a Danish nationwide study.", "journal": ["Europace : European pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac electrophysiology : journal of the working groups on cardiac pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac cellular electrophysiology of the European Society of Cardiology", "Europace"]}
