After randomization into CBZ-CR or LTG\u202f+\u202fVPA, patients entered into eight-week titration phase (TP), followed by 52-week maintenance phase (MP). Median doses of CBZ-CR and LTG\u202f+\u202fVPA were 600\u202fmg/day and 75\u202fmg/day\u202f+\u202f500\u202fmg/day, respectively. Primary outcome measure was completion rate (CR), a proportion of patients who have completed the 60-week study as planned. Secondary efficacy measures included seizure-free rate (SFR) for 52-week of MP and time to first seizure (TTFS) during MP.Among 207 randomized patients, 202 underwent outcome analysis (104 in CBZ-CR, 98 in LTG\u202f+\u202fVPA). CR was 62.5% in CBZ-CR and 65.3% in LTG\u202f+\u202fVPA (p\u202f=\u202f0.678). SFR during MP was higher in LTG\u202f+\u202fVPA (64.1%) than CBZ-CR (47.8%) (P\u202f=\u202f0.034). TTFS was shorter with CBZ-CR (p\u202f=\u202f0.041). Incidence of adverse effects (AEs) were 57.7% in CBZ-CR and 60.2% in LTG\u202f+\u202fVPA and premature drug withdrawal rates due to AEs were 12.5% and 7.1%, respectively, which were not significantly different.CR was comparable between LTG\u202f+\u202fVPA and CBZ-CR, however, both SFR for 52-week MP and TTFS during MP were in favor of LTG\u202f+\u202fVPA than CBZ-CR. The study suggested that LTG\u202f+\u202fVPA can be an option as initial drug regimen for untreated patients with partial seizures and/or GTCS except for women of reproductive age.", "doi": "10.1016/j.seizure.2017.12.008", "title": "Unblinded, randomized multicenter trial comparing lamotrigine and valproate combination with controlled-release carbamazepine monotherapy as initial drug regimen in untreated epilepsy.", "journal": ["Seizure", "Seizure"]}
