It often develops in childhood or adolescence, usually before the age of 40, in a maternally-inherited manner. Mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are frequently responsible for MELAS.A 55-year-old man, who had no family or past history of mitochondrial disorders, suddenly developed bilateral visual field constriction and repeated stroke-like episodes. He ultimately presented with cortical blindness, recurrent epilepsy and severe cognitive impairment approximately 6 months after the first episode. Genetic analysis of biopsied biceps brachii muscle, but not of peripheral white blood cells, revealed a T10158C mutation in the mtDNA-encoded gene of NADH dehydrogenase subunit 3 (ND3), which has previously been thought to be associated with severe or fatal mitochondrial disorders that develop during the neonatal period or in infancy.A T10158C mutation in the ND3 gene can cause atypical adult-onset stroke-like episodes in a sporadic manner.", "doi": "10.1186/s12883-017-1001-4", "title": "Isolated and repeated stroke-like episodes in a middle-aged man with a mitochondrial ND3 T10158C mutation: a case report.", "journal": ["BMC neurology", "BMC Neurol"]}
