Serum concentration of 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 was compared between groups using Student's t-test.Dogs with acute canine polyradiculoneuritis had significantly lower (P=0\u00b7033) serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 concentration (87\u00b71\u2009nmol/L \u00b155\u00b74\u2009nmol/L) compared to a control group with idiopathic epilepsy (113\u2009nmol/L \u00b166\u00b73\u2009nmol/L).The cause and clinical significance of the altered vitamin D status in dogs with acute polyradiculoneuritis are not clear and require further investigation. Our findings pave the way for improved understanding of acute canine polyradiculoneuritis and, potentially, improved clinical management, if a causal role for 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 is defined.", "doi": "10.1111/jsap.12791", "title": "25-Hydroxy vitamin D3 serum concentration in dogs with acute polyradiculoneuritis compared to matched controls.", "journal": ["The Journal of small animal practice", "J Small Anim Pract"]}
