Perampanel exposure was predicted for all subjects and adolescents. Population PK/PD analyses were performed using data from phase III studies to explore the relationship between perampanel exposure and 28-day average seizure frequency and responder probability.Pooled perampanel PK data from 1318 subjects were described by a one-compartment disposition model. In the absence of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) affecting perampanel PK, estimated perampanel apparent clearance (CL/F) was 0.668\u00a0L/h (all subjects) and 0.682\u00a0L/h (adolescent subjects). Co-administration of carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine/phenytoin reduced perampanel exposure. Gender, Asian race (excluding Japanese or Chinese), and increasing alanine aminotransferase lowered perampanel CL/F, but differences were small and not considered clinically relevant. Adolescent outcomes were similar to the total population. Based on PK/PD data from 1748 subjects, percent reduction in 28-day average seizure frequency from baseline and responder probability increased with increasing perampanel exposure; concomitant CYP3A-inducing AEDs lowered perampanel exposure but did not impact the slope for responder probability.These results are consistent with previous analyses but expand on these through inclusion of a larger number of patients from different ethnic groups, and demonstrate that outcomes were similar between adults and adolescents.", "doi": "10.1111/ane.12874", "title": "Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis of adjunctive perampanel in subjects with partial-onset seizures.", "journal": ["Acta neurologica Scandinavica", "Acta Neurol.
