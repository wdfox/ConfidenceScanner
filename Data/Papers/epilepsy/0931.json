The aims of our study were to evaluate the prevalence and determinants of low BMD among Malaysian children with epilepsy.Cross-sectional study of ambulant children with epilepsy on long-term AEDs for >1 year seen in a tertiary hospital in Malaysia from 2014 to 2015. Detailed assessment of anthropometric measurements; environmental lifestyle risk factors; serum vitamin D, calcium and parathyroid hormone levels; genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms of genes in vitamin D and calcium metabolism; and lumbar spine BMD were obtained. Low BMD was defined as BMD Z-score\u00a0\u2264\u00a0-2.0 SD.Eighty-seven children with mean age of 11.9 years (56 males) participated in the study. The prevalence of low lumbar BMD was 21.8% (19 patients). Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified polytherapy >2 AEDs (OR: 7.86; 95% CI 1.03-59.96), small frame size with wrist breadth of <15th centile (OR 14.73; 95% CI 2.21-98.40), and body mass index Z-score\u00a0<\u00a0-2.0 (OR 8.73, 95% CI 1.17-65.19) as significant risk factors for low BMD.One-fifth of Malaysian children with epilepsy on long-term AEDs had low BMD. Targeted BMD should be performed for those who are on >2 AEDs, underweight or with small frame size as they are at higher risk of having low BMD.", "doi": "10.1016/j.ejpn.2017.10.007", "title": "Determinants of low bone mineral density in children with epilepsy.", "journal": ["European journal of paediatric neurology : EJPN : official journal of the European Paediatric Neurology Society", "Eur.
