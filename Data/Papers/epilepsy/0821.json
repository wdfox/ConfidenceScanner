Kurtosis analysis allows for identification of spiky activity in the brain. To evaluate the reliability of eLORETA kurtosis analysis, the results of the analysis were compared with those of equivalent current dipole (ECD) and synthetic aperture magnetometry (SAM) kurtosis analysis of magnetoencephalography (MEG) data in a patient with epilepsy with elementary visual seizures in a 6-year follow-up.The results of electroencephalography (EEG) eLORETA kurtosis analysis indicative of a right superior temporal spike source partially overlapped with MEG ECD/SAM kurtosis results in all recordings, with a total overlapping at the end of the follow-up period. Overall findings suggest that eLORETA kurtosis analysis of EEG data may aid in the localisation of spike activity sources in patients with epilepsy.", "doi": "10.1136/bcr-2017-222123", "title": "Source estimation of epileptic activity using eLORETA kurtosis analysis.", "journal": ["BMJ case reports", "BMJ Case Rep"]}
