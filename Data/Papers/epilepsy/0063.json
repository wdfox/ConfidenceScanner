However, there is no exhaustive data regarding the pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) kindling model of epilepsy.The aim of our study was to analyse the hippocampal changes in the expression of GABA-A receptor subunits involved in phasic (\u03b11, \u03b32) or tonic (\u03b14 and \u03b4) inhibition in rats subjected to the PTZ kindling using immunohistochemistry method as well as in animals subjected to a single injection of a subconvulsive (30\u202fmg/kg) or convulsive (55\u202fmg/kg) dose of PTZ. Moreover, the expression of GABA transporters (GAT-1 and GAT-3) was also assessed.In kindled animals, we observed an increase in the expression of \u03b11 (in CA1, DG (dentate gyrus) and CA3 regions) and \u03b32 (CA1 and CA3) subunits as well as in the expression of GAT-1 (CA1). On the other hand, the expression of the \u03b4 subunit in the DG was reduced. The single injection of PTZ at a dose of 30\u202fmg/kg increased the expression of the \u03b14 subunit in the DG, while at a dose of 55\u202fmg/kg, PTZ increased the expression of the \u03b11 and \u03b14 subunits in the DG and reduced expression of the \u03b32 subunit in the CA1 and CA3 regions.The pattern of changes observed in our study indicates that changes in tonic inhibition are involved in abnormal neuronal activity observed in PTZ model of epilepsy.", "doi": "10.1016/j.pharep.2017.07.008", "title": "Altered expression of GABA-A receptor subunits in the hippocampus of PTZ-kindled rats.", "journal": ["Pharmacological reports : PR", "Pharmacol Rep"]}
