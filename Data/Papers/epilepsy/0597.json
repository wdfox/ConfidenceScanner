This interaction can be seen in analogy to other cerebral functions arising from a network or zone such as language. Within this network, yawning fulfills its function in a stereotype, reflex-like manner; a phylogenetically old function, preserved across species barriers, with the purpose of arousal, communication, and maybe other functions including respiration. Abnormal yawning with \u22653 yawns/15min without obvious cause arises from lesions of brain areas involved in the yawning zone, its trajectories causing a disconnection syndrome, or from alteration of network activity by physical or metabolic etiologies including medication.", "doi": "10.1016/j.pneurobio.2017.11.003", "title": "Yawning-Its anatomy, chemistry, role, and pathological considerations.", "journal": ["Progress in neurobiology", "Prog.
