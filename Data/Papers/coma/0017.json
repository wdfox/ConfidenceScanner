SIRS was defined by standard criteria as 2 or more of the following on admission: (1) body temperature <36\u00b0C or >38\u00b0C, (2) heart rate >90 beats per minute, (3) respiratory rate >20 breaths per minute, or (4) white blood cell count <4,000/mm3 or >12,000/mm3. The relationship among SIRS, infection, and poor outcome (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] 3-6) at discharge and 3 months was assessed.Of 2,441 patients included, 343 (14%) met SIRS criteria at admission. Patients with SIRS were younger (58.2 vs 62.7 years; p < 0.0001) and more likely to have intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH; 53.6% vs 36.7%; p < 0.0001), higher admission hematoma volume (25.4 vs 17.5 mL; p < 0.0001), and lower admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS; 10.7 vs 13.1; p < 0.0001). SIRS on admission was significantly related to infections during hospitalization (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.36, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.78). In unadjusted analyses, SIRS was associated with poor outcomes at discharge (OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.42-2.70) and 3 months (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.35-2.33) after ICH. In analyses adjusted for infection, age, IVH, hematoma location, admission GCS, and premorbid mRS, SIRS was no longer associated with poor outcomes.SIRS on admission is associated with ICH score on admission and infection, but it was not an independent predictor of poor functional outcomes after ICH.", "doi": "10.1212/NXI.0000000000000428", "title": "Systemic inflammatory response syndrome, infection, and outcome in intracerebral hemorrhage.", "journal": ["Neurology(R) neuroimmunology & neuroinflammation", "Neurol Neuroimmunol Neuroinflamm"]}
