The aim of this study was to investigate the recovery of patients with pure DAI who remained in a coma for 6 hours or longer after brain injury.This was a follow-up study of 75 patients diagnosed with pure DAI, aged 18-60 years, with a Glasgow Coma Scale score \u22648 at hospital admission. Patient data were collected at hospital admission, hospital discharge, and 3 and 6 months after DAI. Recovery was assessed by score changes in the Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living and Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale.The percentage of patients in a coma for 6-24 hours, >24 hours without brainstem signs, and >24 hours with brainstem signs was 42.7%, 20%, and 37.3%, respectively. The 6-month mortality rate was 32.0%, and the mean Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale score among survivors decreased from 3.8 at discharge (SD\u00a0= 1.2) to 2.1 at 3 months (SD\u00a0= 1.6) and 1.2 at 6 months (SD\u00a0= 1.6). The mean Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living scores were 8.5 (SD\u00a0= 5.5), 3.5 (SD\u00a0= 5.8), and 1.8 (SD\u00a0= 4.5) at discharge and 3 and 6 months after trauma, respectively. Statistically significant differences were observed among the 3 evaluation periods.Mortality was high among patients with DAI, but almost all survivors had favorable outcomes at 6 months. Functional improvement was more pronounced in the first 3 months.", "doi": "10.1016/j.wneu.2017.09.101", "title": "Recovery of Patients with Pure Diffuse Axonal Injury Who Remained in a Coma for 6 Hours or More.", "journal": ["World neurosurgery", "World Neurosurg"]}
