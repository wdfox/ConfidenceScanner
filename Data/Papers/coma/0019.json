Three presbyopia correction IOLs were analyzed: Mini WELL (MW), TECNIS Symfony ZXR00 (SYM), and Lentis Mplus X LS-313 MF30 (MP). Three different pupil sizes were used for the comparison: 3, 4, and 4.7\u2009mm.MW generated negative primary and positive secondary spherical aberrations (SA) for the apertures of 3\u2009mm (-0.13 and +0.12\u2009\u03bcm), 4\u2009mm (-0.12 and +0.08\u2009\u03bcm), and 4.7\u2009mm (-0.11 and +0.08\u2009\u03bcm), while the SYM only generated negative primary SA for 4 and 4.7\u2009mm apertures (-0.12\u2009\u03bcm and -0.20\u2009\u03bcm, resp.). The MP induced coma and trefoil for all pupils and showed significant HOAs for apertures of 4 and 4.7\u2009mm.In an optical bench, the MW induces negative primary and positive secondary SA for all pupils. The SYM aberrations seem to be pupil dependent; it does not produce negative primary SA for 3\u2009mm but increases for higher pupils. Meanwhile, the HOAs for the MW and SYM were not significant. The MP showed in all cases the highest HOAs.", "doi": "10.1155/2017/7095734", "title": "In Vitro Aberrometric Assessment of a Multifocal Intraocular Lens and Two Extended Depth of Focus IOLs.", "journal": ["Journal of ophthalmology", "J Ophthalmol"]}
