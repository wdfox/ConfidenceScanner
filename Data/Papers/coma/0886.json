Waves of neurochemical abnormalities that follow TBI may serve as fluid biomarkers of neurological status. We assessed the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of glutamate, lactate, BDNF, and GDNF, to identify potential prognostic biomarkers of neurological outcome.This cross-sectional study was carried out in a total of 20 consecutive patients (mean [SD] age, 29 [13] years; M/F, 9:1) with severe TBI Glasgow Coma Scale \u2264 8 and abnormal computed tomography scan on admission. Patients were submitted to ventricular drainage and had CSF collected between 2 and 4 h after hospital admission. Patients were then stratified according to two clinical outcomes: deterioration to brain death (nonsurvival, n = 6) or survival (survival, n = 14), within 3 days after hospital admission. CSF levels of brain-derived substances were compared between nonsurvival and survival groups. Clinical and neurological parameters were also assessed.Glutamate and lactate are significantly increased in nonsurvival relative to survival patients. We tested the accuracy of both biomarkers to discriminate patient outcome. Setting a cutoff of >57.75, glutamate provides 80.0% of sensitivity and 84.62% of specificity (AUC: 0.8214, 95% CL: 54.55-98.08%; and a cutoff of >4.65, lactate has 100% of sensitivity and 85.71% of specificity (AUC: 0.8810, 95% CL: 54.55-98.08%). BDNF and GDNF did not discriminate poor outcome.This early study suggests that glutamate and lactate concentrations at hospital admission accurately predict death within 3 days after severe TBI.", "doi": "10.1002/acn3.416", "title": "Elevated glutamate and lactate predict brain death after severe head trauma.", "journal": ["Annals of clinical and translational neurology", "Ann Clin Transl Neurol"]}
