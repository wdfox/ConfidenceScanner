Patients were classified according to severity of head injury and age. We defined mild TBI as Glasgow coma scale (GCS) 13 - 15, moderate as GCS 9 - 12, and severe as GCS \u22648, in accordance with international standards. We divided the cohort according to ages 0 - 5 years, 6 - 10 years, &gt;10 - 17 years and adults (&gt;17 years).From January 2012 to December 2014, 3 301 patients were treated for TBI in PMB. The mean age was 27.4 (standard deviation 14.4) years. There were 2 632 males and 564 females. There were 2 540 mild, 326 moderate, and 329 severe TBI admissions during the period under review. A total of 139 (4.2%) patients died. A total of 242 (7.3%) patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), of whom 137 (57.0%) had a GCS of \u22649. Only 27.0% of patients with a GCS of \u22649 were admitted to the ICU.There is a significant burden of TBI managed by the PMTS.
