Uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), best spectacle corrected visual acuity (BSCVA), CS, and higher order aberrations (HOAs) were evaluated at baseline and 1, 3, 6, and 8 months after surgery.The mean total HOAs of the included patients were 2.24, 2.34, 2.28, 2.17, and 2.03 \u03bcm before and 1, 3, 6, and 8 months after CXL, respectively. A significant reduction in corneal HOAs including vertical coma, vertical and horizontal trefoil and spherical aberration was observed 6 and 8 months after CXL. UDVA and BSCVA improved significantly in all patients who completed the follow-up period (P = 0.001). Although mean CS declined significantly 1 month postoperatively, it improved significantly after 3, 6, and 8 months (P<0.001). Maximum keratometry was significantly lower 8 months postoperatively compared to the preoperative value. (P = 0.006).CXL seems to improve UCVA, BSCVA, and CS and reduce most corneal HOAs in progressive forms of keratoconus.", "doi": "10.4103/jovr.jovr_30_16", "title": "Evaluation of Changes in Visual Acuity, Contrast Sensitivity and Aberrations in Patients with Keratoconus after Corneal Collagen Cross-linking.", "journal": ["Journal of ophthalmic & vision research", "J Ophthalmic Vis Res"]}
