Trauma severity was determined by Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), neurological outcome by King's Outcome Scale for Childhood Head Injury (KOSCHI) and neuropsychological outcome by Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children - Fourth Edition.Twenty-five children (median age 6 years at trauma) were included. Patients were divided into Disability (DIS)(n\u00a0=\u00a010) and Good Recovery (GR)(n\u00a0=\u00a015) groups. Initial GCS score was not significantly different in both groups (median 6 vs. 10; p\u00a0=\u00a00.34). DIS group had lower values \u200b\u200bof working memory index (WMI)(median 74 vs. 94; p\u00a0=\u00a00.004), perceptual reasoning index (PRI)(75 vs. 96; p\u00a0=\u00a00.03), verbal comprehension index (VCI)(65 vs. 84; p\u00a0=\u00a00.02), processing speed index (PSI)(74 vs. 97; p\u00a0=\u00a00.01) and full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ)(65 vs. 87; p\u00a0=\u00a00.008). In the GR group, 60% of patients had normal or minimally altered MRI versus 10% of patients in the DIS group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.018). Fractional anisotropy positively correlated with WMI(r\u00a0=\u00a00.65; p\u00a0=\u00a00.005), PRI(r\u00a0=\u00a00.52; p\u00a0=\u00a00.03) and FSIQ(r\u00a0=\u00a00.50; p\u00a0=\u00a00.04).Neuropsychological impairment was observed in 40% of children who suffered a TBI and was associated with late MRI abnormalities.", "doi": "10.1080/02699052.2017.1358398", "title": "Neuropsychological outcome of children with traumatic brain injury and its association with late magnetic resonance imaging findings: A cohort study.", "journal": ["Brain injury", "Brain Inj"]}
