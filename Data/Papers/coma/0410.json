We found that the introduction of coma aberrations causes significant modification to the Brownian motion of the trapped particle, producing an apparent cross-coupling between the in-plane aberrated axis and the weaker propagation axis. This coupling is evidenced by the emergence of a second dominant low frequency Lorentzian feature in the position power spectral density. The effect on Brownian motion was confirmed using a secondary unaberrated probe beam, ruling out the possibility of systematic optical effects related to the detection system.", "doi": null, "title": "Using back focal plane interferometry to probe the influence of Zernike aberrations in optical tweezers.", "journal": ["Optics letters", "Opt Lett"]}
