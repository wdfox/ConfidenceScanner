At 12\u00a0months, 61% vs 53% had UDCVA of 20/25 or better, 100% vs 76% gained \u22651 lines, and 59% vs 43% were within \u00b10.13 D spherical equivalent. In the PCRI group, anterior KA decreased at 1\u00a0month and remained stable thereafter; there was a nonsignificant trend toward a flatter posterior KA and steeper posterior KM and the total corneal Z2-2 was low at 1 and 12\u00a0months. Over 12\u00a0months, there were changes in posterior corneal tilt, coma, and hexafoil in the PCRI group. The mean rotation of the tIOLs at 12\u00a0months was 1.8 \u00b1 1.4 degrees. tIOL patients were happier and were glad to use the nonprescription sunglasses.There was no difference in visual acuity, although more tIOL patients gained \u22651 line and were within \u00b10.13 D. After PCRIs, the anterior KA decreased in the early postoperative period and remained\u00a0stable thereafter and posterior corneal aberrations changed constantly over 12\u00a0months.", "doi": "10.1016/j.ajo.2017.06.007", "title": "Toric Intraocular Lenses Versus Peripheral Corneal Relaxing Incisions for Astigmatism Between 0.75 and 2.5 Diopters During Cataract\u00a0Surgery.", "journal": ["American journal of ophthalmology", "Am.
