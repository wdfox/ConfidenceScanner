It affects elderly populations who often have significant medical co-morbidities resulting in poor prognosis. The study aimed at identifying clinical factors influencing the survival following surgical management of CSDH.Retrospective study included 267 cases that underwent surgery for CSDH and followed over 5-year period (2010-2015); data retrieved with reference to operation details, radiology reports and discharge. Using logistic and Cox regression analysis, the patient survival data was analysed with respect to patient demographics, type of surgery, co-morbidities, anticoagulation treatment, and discharge destination.The overall survival in the cohort was 37.0months (IQR: 20.0-60.0). The median age of the patients was 76years (IQR: 66-82) and the median length of hospital stay was 10days (range 1-126days; IQR: 6-17days). The recurrence rate was 6.37% (n=17). Fifty-three (19.85%) patients recorded deceased on the IPM database as of October 2016 and of those 11 died in hospital. Univariate Cox-regression analysis revealed increased age (HR: 1.80; 95%CI: 1.04-3.11), length of hospital stay (HR: 2.50; 95%CI: 1.41-4.41) and number of co-morbidities (HR: 2.19; 95%CI: 1.26-3.79) were associated with poor prognosis. Glasgow coma scale (GCS) at discharge was found to be significantly associated with survival whilst anticoagulation treatment did not. Multivariate analysis confirmed similar findings significant statistically.Age at admission, median length of hospital stay, number of co-morbidities, GCS at discharge and discharge destination have been found to influence survival significant statistically.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jocn.2017.06.038", "title": "Factors affecting the survival following surgical treatment of chronic subdural haematoma: Single institutional experience.", "journal": ["Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia", "J Clin Neurosci"]}
