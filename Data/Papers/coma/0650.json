The patient may be agitated, but central nervous system (CNS) depression and presentation with coma is more common and could be lethal. Serious CNS toxicity often requires hemoperfusion and/or hemodialysis (HD). Herein, we present a case of a comatose patient, who was treated with a combination of hemoperfusion and HD in series. Our approach to treat the patient with a combination of hemoperfusion and HD was based on evidence from the literature supporting that the hemoperfusion and HD in series might provide the best clearance of carbamazepine.", "doi": null, "title": "A case of severe carbamazepine overdose treated successfully with combined hemoperfusion and hemodialysis technique.", "journal": ["Saudi journal of kidney diseases and transplantation : an official publication of the Saudi Center for Organ Transplantation, Saudi Arabia", "Saudi J Kidney Dis Transpl"]}
