Secondary objective is to find predictors of poor outcome.In all, 89 neonates enrolled, 10 expired and 24 neonates had abnormal NE at discharge. A total of 59 neonates came for follow up, 13 had DQ\u2009<\u200970. Prolonged shock (odds ratio, OR: 8.28; p\u2009=\u20090.001), coma (OR: 4.3; p\u2009=\u20090.001), seizures (OR: 14; p\u2009=\u20090.012), mechanical ventilation (OR: 18.55; p\u2009=\u20090.00), orogastric feeding (OR: 2.78; p\u2009=\u20090.042) and electroencephalography (EEG; OR: 9.6; p\u2009=\u20090.00) predicted poor short-term outcome. Abnormal NE at discharge (OR: 15.6; p\u2009=\u20090.001), EEG (OR\u2009=\u200910.60; p\u2009=\u20090.00) and brainstem-evoked reflex audiometry (OR\u2009=\u200937.20, p\u2009=\u20090.00) predicted a low DQ at 3\u2009months. Mortality and morbidity of neonates with Pyogenic Meningitis (PM) were similar to that in developed countries. Outcome depended on severity of the disease and NE at discharge.", "doi": "10.1093/tropej/fmx066", "title": "Predictors of Poor Outcome in Neonates with Pyogenic Meningitis in a Level-Three Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of Developing Country.", "journal": ["Journal of tropical pediatrics", "J.
