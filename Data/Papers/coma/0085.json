Moreover, we aim to evaluate the outcome of the TBI victims referred to our medico-surgical Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and to define predictive factors associated with poor prognosis.A retrospective study over a 4-year period (2009 to 2012) of 694 patients with head injuries, incurred during road traffic accidents, admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of a university hospital (Sfax-Tunisia). Basic demographic, clinical, biological, and radiological data were recorded on admission and during the ICU stay.There were 592 males (85.3%), and 102 female patients. The mean age was at 31.8\u2009\u00b1\u200917.8\u00a0years (range 1-91). The mechanism of the accident was detailed in 666 patients (96%). The majority of the victims were motorcycle riders and/or passengers (40.5%), followed by pedestrians (29.1%). Extra-cranial pathology was present in 452 patients (65%). A total of 677 patients (97.6%) required intubation, mechanical ventilation, and sedation. Mean ICU stay was 16\u2009\u00b1\u200917.4\u00a0days. A total of 187 patients (26.9%) died during their hospital stay. The GOS performed within a mean delay of 6\u00a0months after hospital discharge was as follows: 198 deaths (28.5%), 13 vegetative state (1.9%), and 349 (50.3%) good recovery and/or moderate disability. A multivariate analysis showed that the factors which correlated with a poor prognosis (mortality and severe disability) were: age\u2009>\u200938 years, Glasgow coma scale score\u2009<\u20098, subdural hematoma, and development of secondary systemic insults (respiratory, circulatory, and metabolic).In Tunisia, traumatic brain injury due to RTAs is a frequent cause of ICU admission, especially among young adults, and is associated with high mortality and morbidity rates. The majority of the victims were motorcycle riders and/or passengers and pedestrians. The factors associated with a poor outcome were: age\u2009>\u200938 years, Glasgow Coma Scale score\u2009<\u20098, subdural hematoma, and development of secondary systemic insults (respiratory, circulatory, and metabolic). As a consequence, prevention is highly warranted.", "doi": "10.1007/s00068-017-0885-4", "title": "Clinical characteristics and prognosis of traumatic head injury following road traffic accidents admitted in ICU \"analysis of 694 cases\".", "journal": ["European journal of trauma and emergency surgery : official publication of the European Trauma Society", "Eur J Trauma Emerg Surg"]}
