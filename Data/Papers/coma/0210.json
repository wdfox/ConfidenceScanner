Diagnostic criteria for brain death are explicit but controversy exists regarding nuances of the evaluation and potential confounders of the examination. Hospitals and ICU teams should carefully consider which clinicians will perform brain death testing and should use standard processes, including checklists to prevent diagnostic errors. Proper diagnosis is essential because misdiagnosis can be catastrophic. Timely, accurate brain death determination and aggressive physiologic support are cornerstones of both good end-of-life care and successful organ donation.", "doi": "10.1016/j.suc.2017.07.001", "title": "Brain Death.", "journal": ["The Surgical clinics of North America", "Surg.
