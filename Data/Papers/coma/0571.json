We aimed to establish the role of ischemic modified albumin (IMA) in the early diagnosis of the process, starting with increased intracranial pressure and ending with brain death.Eighteen Wistar-Albino rats were divided into three groups; control (CG, n = 6), increased intracranial pressure (ICPG, n = 6), and brain death (BDG, n = 6). Intracranial pressure elevation and brain death were constituted with the inflation of a balloon of a Fogarty catheter in the epidural space. In all three groups, blood samples were drawn before the procedure, and at minutes 150 and 240 for IMA and malondialdehyde (MDA) analysis.Serum IMA levels at 150 and 240 minutes were higher in ICPG than in CG (p < 0.05). IMA levels were similar in ICPG and BDG. Serum MDA levels at 150 and 240 minutes increased in ICPG and BDG groups compared to CG (p < 0.05). MDA levels were similar in ICP and BD groups.IMA should be considered as a biochemical parameter in the process starting from increased intracranial pressure elevation and ending at brain death (Tab. 3, Fig. 5, Ref. 31).", "doi": "10.4149/BLL_2017_023", "title": "Role of ischemic modified albumin in the early diagnosis of increased intracranial pressure and brain death.", "journal": ["Bratislavske lekarske listy", "Bratisl Lek Listy"]}
