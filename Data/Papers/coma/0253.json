The corneal surface shape parameters, including surface regularity index (SRI) and surface asymmetry index (SAI), were attained with an OPD-III SCAN. The higher-order aberrations and higher-order Strehl ratios were calculated under a 3\u2009mm pupil diameter before orthokeratology, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after orthokeratology. A P value of less than 0.05 was statistically significant.Months after orthokeratology, SRI and SAI were both showing a significant increase in comparison with those before orthokeratology (P < 0.001). After orthokeratology, for a 3\u2009mm pupil, the higher-order Strehl ratio presented a reduction of 0.217 \u03bcm (P < 0.001), and the higher-order aberration root mean square (HOA RMS) showed a mean increase of 0.100 \u03bcm (P < 0.001). There were significant increases in spherical aberration (P < 0.001) and coma (P = 0.044) after orthokeratology. Trefoil showed a slight reduction at month 6 after orthokeratology, but there was no statistical significance (P = 0.722).Overnight orthokeratology for a correction of myopia resulted in a significant improvement in refractive error but increased corneal irregularity and ocular higher-order aberrations, especially in spherical aberration.", "doi": "10.1155/2017/3279821", "title": "Influence of Overnight Orthokeratology on Corneal Surface Shape and Optical Quality.", "journal": ["Journal of ophthalmology", "J Ophthalmol"]}
