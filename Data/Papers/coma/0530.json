Differently from the ischemic stroke, there are few guidelines for directing management of sICH. This article aims to analyze both clinical outcomes and prognostic factors in order to produce tools for the design of prospective randomized studies addressed to implement treatment of pediatric sICH.Twelve-year retrospective review of a single-center consecutivesICH pediatric cases admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Selected end points were survival, PICU stay, and dichotomized Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS), with recovery and moderate disability (GOS 4-5) classified as favorable outcome and vegetative state or severe disability (GOS 2-3) classified as unfavorable.Data of 107 children younger than 14 years admitted to our PICU due to sICH were analyzed. Overall PICU mortality was 24.2%. On multivariate analysis, the single factor markedly influencing survival was the presence of midline shift ( P = .002). In PICU survivors, there were 42 GOS 2-3 and 39 GOS 4-5. A low Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) on PICU admission was predictive of severe neurological impairment in survivors ( P = .003). Intraventricular hemorrhage and infratentorial origin did not influence outcome in this series.The severity of presentation of sICH expressed by the midline shift and the GCS at PICU admission are significant prognostic factors for survival and neurological outcome. Some prognostic factors of the adult population have not been confirmed.", "doi": "10.1177/0885066617726049", "title": "Clinical Outcomes and Prognostic Factors for Spontaneous Intracerebral Hemorrhage in Pediatric ICU: A 12-Year Experience.", "journal": ["Journal of intensive care medicine", "J Intensive Care Med"]}
