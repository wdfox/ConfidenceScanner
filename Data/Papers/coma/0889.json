The patients were subjected to corneal tomography, aberrometry, measurements of manifest refraction and visual acuity (VA), and visual analog scale (VAS) assessments. The study lenses were made using a molding method and consisted of six standardized types, in which an asymmetric power distribution of approximately 2 to 12 D (2-D step) was used to correct HOAs. The lens type suitable for each eye was selected based on the corneal tomography and aberrometry data. The on-eye performance of the lens was evaluated using aberrometry (4-mm pupil), over refraction, VA, and VAS.The standardized asymmetric SCL improved the best spectacle-corrected VA from -0.07 \u00b1 0.09 to -0.11 \u00b1 0.08 logMAR (P < 0.05) and the mean VAS score from 66.2 \u00b1 21.8 to 75.4 \u00b1 20.5 (P < 0.05). Vertical coma decreased significantly (-0.50 \u00b1 0.36 \u03bcm without SCL; -0.36 \u00b1 0.34 \u03bcm with SCL; P < 0.01). In subgroup analysis, subjects in the high VAS group (score \u2265 75) accounted for 70% of all subjects, and this was the group in which the vertical coma decreased significantly from the level without the lens.A standardized asymmetric SCL can reduce HOAs and improve vision quality when compared with spectacles in patients with keratoconus who wear rigid gas-permeable lenses.", "doi": "10.1167/iovs.16-21296", "title": "Visual Performance and Optical Quality of Standardized Asymmetric Soft Contact Lenses in Patients With Keratoconus.", "journal": ["Investigative ophthalmology & visual science", "Invest.
