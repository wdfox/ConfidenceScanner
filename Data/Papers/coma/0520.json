They have species-specific temperatures below which movements become uncoordinated prior to entering a reversible state of neuromuscular paralysis. In spite of decades of research, which in recent years has focused on muscle function, the role of neural mechanisms in determining chill coma is unknown. Spreading depolarization (SD) is a phenomenon that causes a shutdown of neural function in the integrating centres of the central nervous system. We investigated the role of SD in the process of entering chill coma in the locust, Locusta migratoria. We used thermolimit respirometry and electromyography in whole animals and extracellular and intracellular recording techniques in semi-intact preparations to characterize neural events during chilling. We show that chill-induced SD in the central nervous system is the mechanism underlying the critical thermal minimum for coordinated movement in locusts. This finding will be important for understanding how insects adapt and acclimate to changing environmental temperatures.", "doi": "10.1038/s41598-017-10586-6", "title": "Chill coma in the locust, Locusta migratoria, is initiated by spreading depolarization in the central nervous system.", "journal": ["Scientific reports", "Sci Rep"]}
