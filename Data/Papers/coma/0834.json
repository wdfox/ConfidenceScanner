However, hypoglycemia should be avoided in the treatment of diabetes. We herein report two late-stage elderly subjects who experienced a severe and prolonged hypoglycemic coma after the usage of CZ. These cases suggest that, when CZ is administered to elderly subjects with renal dysfunction and/or frailty, we should be aware of the possibility that this medicine may induce hypoglycemia and should adjust the dose as appropriate and monitor the concentration of CZ to avoid severe hypoglycemia.", "doi": "10.2169/internalmedicine.56.8120", "title": "Hypoglycemic Coma Induced by the Use of Succinic Acid Cibenzoline in Frail Late-stage Elderly Subjects.", "journal": ["Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)", "Intern.
