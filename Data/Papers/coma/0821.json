Patients with SI-ASW (n\u00a0=\u00a01724) and non-SI-ASW (n\u00a0=\u00a07820) were compared. Predictors for non-therapeutic laparotomy/laparoscopy (non-TL) in SI-ASW patients were identified.SI-ASW patients were older, had more females and behavioral disorders, similar physiology, but a lower Injury Severity Score. They had more laparotomies overall (54 versus 48%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and more non-TL (42 versus 32%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), but less injuries (43 versus 53%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), although peritoneal violation rate was similar. Complications and mortality were similar. In the SI-ASW cohort, non-TL patients were more likely to be female and younger, and to have Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) \u226513 and a higher systolic blood pressure. History of psychiatric, drug and alcohol disorders was associated with SI-ASW, but did not independently predict the need for treatment in adjusted models.Patients with SI-ASW underwent more non-TL than patients with non-SI-ASW. Female gender, younger age, and a higher GCS and systolic blood pressure predicted non-TL in this group.", "doi": "10.1007/s00268-017-4083-7", "title": "Self-Inflicted Abdominal Stab Wounds Have a Higher Rate of Non-therapeutic Laparotomy/Laparoscopy and a Lower Risk of Injury.", "journal": ["World journal of surgery", "World J Surg"]}
