Logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution uncorrected (UDVA) and best-corrected (CDVA) distance visual acuity, corneal asphericity, root mean square for coma-like aberrations [computed for the Zernike terms Z (3, 1) and Z (3, -1)], and residual refractive errors analyzed using vector analysis were recorded before and at all follow-up visits. The postoperative follow-up duration was 3 years in all cases.Mean UDVA (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution scale) rose from 1.18 \u00b1 0.59 to a postoperative 0.53 \u00b1 0.39 after ICRS implantation (P < 0.0001). Mean CDVA varied in turn from 0.36 \u00b1 0.18 to 0.17 \u00b1 0.10 (P < 0.0001). CDVA remained unchanged or improved in all eyes after surgery. Both UDVA and CDVA were stable over the postoperative period (P > 0.05). The spherical equivalent declined steeply after ICRS implantation (P < 0.0001). Both spherical equivalent and refractive cylinder were stable over the postoperative period. The corneal asphericity and root mean square values for coma-like aberrations exhibited statistically significant decreases 6 months after ICRS implantation (P < 0.0001) and were also stable over postoperative follow-up (P > 0.05).These results suggest that implanting a single, inferior, 210-degree arc-length Ferrara-type ICRS is a safe, effective, and stable procedure for treating patients with central hyperprolate keratoconus.", "doi": "10.1097/ICO.0000000000001339", "title": "Long-Term Follow-up of Intrastromal Corneal Ring Segments (210-Degree Arc Length) in Central Keratoconus With High Corneal Asphericity.", "journal": ["Cornea", "Cornea"]}
