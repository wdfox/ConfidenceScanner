Within the context of medicine several ethics support services have been developed to support healthcare professionals in dealing with ethical dilemmas, including moral case deliberation. In this article, we describe how moral case deliberation works in daily practice, illustrated with a case example from the neurology ward. The article is meant as an introduction to moral case deliberation according to the dilemma method. We show its relevance to the clinic and the context needed to put it into practice.", "doi": "10.1136/practneurol-2017-001740", "title": "Moral case deliberation.", "journal": ["Practical neurology", "Pract Neurol"]}
