We measured intraocular pressure (IOP), refractive errors, anterior chamber depth (ACD), and HOA before surgery and 1, 2, and 4\u00a0weeks postoperatively. The patients were divided into two groups on the basis of preoperative lens status: phakic and pseudophakic group. We used a paired t test to compare preoperative and postoperative HOA values. Regression analysis was used to compare higher-order total (HOT) change and factors including ACD and age.For entire eye aberrations, coma-like and total HOT were significantly increased postoperatively at 1\u00a0week (P\u00a0=\u00a00.029, P\u00a0=\u00a00.005, respectively), but not after 2 or 4\u00a0weeks in the phakic group and were not significant at any time in the pseudophakic group. Corneal HOA were significantly increased postoperatively after 1, 2\u00a0weeks, but not after 4\u00a0weeks in the phakic group and were not significant in the pseudophakic group. For internal optics aberrations, HOA were significantly increased postoperatively at 1, 2, and 4\u00a0weeks in the phakic group, but were not significant at any time in the pseudophakic group. However, HOT aberration change showed no correlation with age, ACD, IOP change in either group.Following trabeculectomy, HOA changes were significantly increased postoperatively at 1, 2\u00a0weeks in the phakic group. Therefore, visual complaint-related HOA changes after trabeculectomy may be more profound in phakic patients.", "doi": "10.1007/s10792-017-0802-1", "title": "Short-term change in higher-order aberrations after mitomycin-C-augmented trabeculectomy.", "journal": ["International ophthalmology", "Int Ophthalmol"]}
