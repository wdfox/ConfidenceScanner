Many cases of methanol poisoning outbreaks have been noted in our population but no study has been performed to estimate methanol exposure and its outcomes and complications. A retrospective study was conducted to review all the cases of methanol poisoning admitted from January 1988 to December 2015 at the Aga Khan University Hospital. A total of 35 methanol poisoning cases were reported. All the patients were male, and the mean age was 36.2\u00b18.6 years. The mean Glasgow Coma Scale score on presentation in the emergency was 10.4 \u00b1 4.4. Blurring of vision was present in 17 (48%) patients while 10 (28%) had complete blindness. Mean arterial pH was 6.8\u00b10.5 on arrival. Ethanol was given to 30(88%) patients and 12(32%) patients received bicarbonate for immediate treatment. A total of 15 (42.8%) patients underwent dialysis, out of which only 5 (33.3%) patients survived. Overall, 19 (54.3%) patients expired secondary to methanol ingestion.", "doi": null, "title": "Methanol poisoning: 27 years experience at a tertiary care hospital.", "journal": ["JPMA.
