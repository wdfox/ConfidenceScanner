These patients were divided into 2 groups: treatment group, and control group. Patients in the control group received routine emergency treatment, while patients in the treatment group additionally received hemoperfusion plus hemodialysis on the basis of routine emergency treatment. The curative effects in these 2 groups and the prognosis after rescue were compared.Compared with the control group, atropinization time, recovery time of cholinesterase activity, recovery time of consciousness, extubation time, and length of hospital stay were shorter (P\u200a<\u200a.05); the total usage of atropine was significantly lower (P\u200a<\u200a.05); Glasgow Coma Score was significantly higher (P\u200a<\u200a.05); acute physiology and chronic health score (APACHE II) was significantly lower (P\u200a<\u200a.05); and mortality and poisoning rebound rate was significantly lower (P\u200a<\u200a.05) in the treatment group.Hemoperfusion and hemodialysis on the basis of routine emergency treatment for critical patients with organophosphorus poisoning can improve rescue outcomes and improve the prognosis of patients, which should be popularized.", "doi": "10.1097/MD.0000000000007237", "title": "Clinical emergency treatment of 68 critical patients with severe organophosphorus poisoning and prognosis analysis after rescue.", "journal": ["Medicine", "Medicine (Baltimore)"]}
