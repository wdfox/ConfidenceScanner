We carried out multivariate logistic regressions, adjusted for age and sex, to describe the relationship between vital sign values recorded in the prehospital setting and 7-day mortality.A total of 32\u2009076 ambulance transfers were recorded. Of these, 20\u2009328 were first-time transfers, including 2692 that received assistance from a physician-staffed mobile emergency care unit (MECU). The 7-day mortality was 5.3% [95% confidence interval (CI): 5.0-5.6]. The risk of death increased with age. The odds ratios (ORs) were 2.0 (95% CI: 1.1-3.5) for ages 30-44 years and 7.3 (95% CI: 4.5-11) for ages 45-69 years compared with the 18-29-year-olds. All abnormal vital sign values were associated with increased 7-day mortality. Glasgow Coma Score of less than 14 had the strongest association (OR: 17, 95% CI: 14.7-19.7). MECU assistance showed an adjusted OR of 5.3 (95% CI: 4.6-6.1).The overall 7-day mortality was 5.3%, but differed in the two subgroups, with 15.4% in the MECU-assisted ambulance transfers and 3.8% in non-MECU-assisted transfers. Older age and Glasgow Coma Scores below 14 were the strongest of factors associated significantly with 7-day mortality.", "doi": "10.1097/MEJ.0000000000000470", "title": "Patients in prehospital transport to the emergency department: a cohort study of risk factors for 7-day mortality.", "journal": ["European journal of emergency medicine : official journal of the European Society for Emergency Medicine", "Eur J Emerg Med"]}
