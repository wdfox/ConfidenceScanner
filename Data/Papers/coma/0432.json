We collected variables related to CA, as well as electroencephalography (EEG) findings, N20 somatosensory evoked potentials, and the presence of I, III and/or V waves on BAEP testing. Outcome was assessed at 3 months using the Cerebral Performance Categories (3-5=poor outcome).We studied 65 patients; 48 (74%) had a poor neurological outcome. BAEP assessment was performed day 3 [3,4] after the CA. At least one of the three waves was absent bilaterally in 34 patients (52%); of these patients, 29 (85%) had a poor neurological outcome (sensitivity 60%, specificity 71%, positive predictive value [PPV] 85% and negative predictive value [NPV] 39%). Three patients (5%) had bilateral absence of all three waves, all of whom had a poor neurological outcome.In this series of patients after CA, at least one of the BAEP waves was absent bilaterally in half the survivors; however, their use for prediction of poor neurological outcome remains limited.", "doi": "10.1016/j.resuscitation.2017.09.013", "title": "The potential role of auditory evoked potentials to assess prognosis in comatose survivors from cardiac arrest.", "journal": ["Resuscitation", "Resuscitation"]}
