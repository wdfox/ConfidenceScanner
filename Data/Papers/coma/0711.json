Her conscious level was E4V2M5 on the Glasgow Coma Scale and she displayed stress cardiomyopathy (Takotsubo cardiomyopathy) with multiple organ failure. Intrauterine fetal death was confirmed. After immediate application of intubated ventilation, percutaneous cardiopulmonary support and hemodialysis, she was diagnosed with pheochromocytoma multisystem crisis. After multidisciplinary team discussion, surgical resection of the left pheochromocytoma was performed on the same day. However, the bleeding from retroperitoneal drainage did not decrease, therefore, on the fourth day of hospitalization, embolization of the left renal artery under angiography was performed. A 2774\u00a0g female infant was stillborn spontaneously on the seventh day of hospitalization. Percutaneous cardiopulmonary support was discontinued on the fifth day of hospitalization and the tracheal tube was extubated on the 11th day. The patient was discharged after 30 days.", "doi": "10.1111/jog.13423", "title": "Sudden onset of pheochromocytoma multisystem crisis at 38\u00a0weeks of gestation resulted in intrauterine fetal death: A case report.", "journal": ["The journal of obstetrics and gynaecology research", "J.
