Seizures and coma are frequent complications of acute renal insufficiency (uremia), whereas peripheral neuropathy and encephalopathy, observed in progressive uremia, are terminal events. Failure to excrete metabolic products causes their accumulation and can lead to severe intoxication. Clinically, the signs and symptoms of uremia can vary widely, depending on the biological characteristics of the patient, the specific type of renal disease, and the time of the uremic intoxication. CKD is an increasing problem worldwide and is now being recognized as a global health burden particularly for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular ischemic events. Despite improvements in the medical management of advanced CKD, including dialysis and transplantation, patients manifest a number of symptoms that neurologists are often confronted with. Appropriate drug dosing, awareness of potential side effects of medications, prompt diagnosis, and treatment are essential in preventing neurological long-term morbidity and mortality.", "doi": "10.1016/j.spen.2016.12.004", "title": "Neurological Complications of Renal Disease.", "journal": ["Seminars in pediatric neurology", "Semin Pediatr Neurol"]}
