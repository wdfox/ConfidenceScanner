Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed, calculating odds ratios for ICL with 95% confidence interval. P\u00a0<\u00a00.05 was considered significant.Data were analyzed on 504 patients with mean\u00b1SD age of 79.37\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.06\u00a0years. Multivariate analysis showed that traffic accident, GCS score of 14/15, transient consciousness loss, nausea, and receipt of antiplatelets were predictors of ICL, while SRRI and/or benzodiazepine intake was a protective factor. A score was assigned to patients by rounding OR values, and a score \u22651 indicated moderate/high risk of ICL.MTBI management should be distinct in over-60\u00a0year-olds, who may not present typical symptoms, with frequent comorbidities. Knowledge of risk factors for post-MTBI ICL, associated with higher mortality, is important to support clinical decision-making. Further research is warranted to verify our novel finding that benzodiazepines and/or SSRI inhibitors may act as neuroprotectors.", "doi": "10.1080/02699052.2017.1382716", "title": "Risk factors for intracranial lesions and mortality in older patients with mild traumatic brain injuries.", "journal": ["Brain injury", "Brain Inj"]}
