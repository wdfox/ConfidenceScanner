Clinical data, including demographics, stroke risk factors, neuroimaging variables, Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) on admission, surgical strategy, and outcome, were collected. Clinical outcome was assessed using a modified Rankin Scale, six\u00a0months after onset. Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed to determine predictors of a poor outcome.Conservative treatment was performed for five patients (9.3%), external ventricular drainage (EVD) for 20 patients (37.0%), THD for four patients (7.4%), and EVD combined with THD for 25 patients (46.3%). At six months after onset, 21 (38.9%) patients achieved a favorable outcome, while 33 (61.1%) had a poor outcome. In the univariate analysis, predictors of poor 6-month outcome were lower GCS on admission (P = 0.001), larger hematoma volume (P < 0.001), midline shift (P = 0.035), acute hydrocephalus (P = 0.039), and no THD (P = 0.037). The independent predictors of poor outcome, according to the multivariate logistic regression analysis, were no THD and larger hematoma volume.Minimally invasive THD, which removes most of the hematoma within a few days, with limited damage to perihematomal brain tissue, improved the 6-month outcome of thalamic hemorrhage. Thus, THD can be widely applied to treat patients with thalamic hemorrhage.", "doi": "10.11909/j.issn.1671-5411.2017.04.006", "title": "Minimally invasive thalamic hematoma drainage can improve the six-month outcome of thalamic hemorrhage.", "journal": ["Journal of geriatric cardiology : JGC", "J Geriatr Cardiol"]}
