It typically manifests with petechial rash, deteriorating mental status, and progressive respiratory insufficiency, usually occurring within 24-48\u00a0h of trauma with long-bone fractures or an orthopedic surgery. The diagnosis of FES is based on clinical and imaging findings, but requires exclusion of alternative diagnoses. Although there is no specific treatment for FES, prompt recognition is important because it can avoid unnecessary interventions and clarify prognosis. Patients with severe FES can become critically ill, but even comatose patients with respiratory failure may recover favorably. Prophylactic measures, such as early stabilization of fractures and certain intraoperative techniques, may help decrease the incidence and severity of FES.", "doi": "10.1007/s12028-017-0463-y", "title": "Cerebral Fat Embolism: Recognition, Complications, and Prognosis.", "journal": ["Neurocritical care", "Neurocrit Care"]}
