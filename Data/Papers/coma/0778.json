The majority suffer from mild head injury. After clarification of the initial symptoms in these patients, the main aim is to recognize or exclude intracranial injuries (bleeding). Demonstration of intracranial bleeding is possible with cranial computed tomography (CCT), which in contrast to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be quickly carried out in most cases; however, most patients with mild head injury show no intracranial bleeding. The performance of CCT and the often necessary hospital admission place a\u00a0severe physical and psychological burden on the elderly. The plasma parameter S100B, combined with the clinical findings, is a\u00a0valuable instrument for decision making in the management of elderly patients with mild head injury.", "doi": "10.1007/s00391-017-1274-7", "title": "[Mild head injuries in the elderly].", "journal": ["Zeitschrift fur Gerontologie und Geriatrie", "Z Gerontol Geriatr"]}
