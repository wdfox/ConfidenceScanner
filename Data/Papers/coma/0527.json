Demography of patients, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, shock index, shock index age (SIA), blood pressure age index (BPAI), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), injury severity score (ISS), and in-hospital mortality were analyzed. Univariate analysis was used to compare those who died with those who survived. Significant factors were then entered into a backward logistic regression model to define factors predicting mortality.80.3% of the patients were males. The median (range) age of patients was 26 (1-78) years. Significant factors that predicted mortality were GCS (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), SIA (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003), ISS (p\u00a0=\u00a00.007), and BPAI (p\u00a0=\u00a00.022).The physiological variables including GCS and shock index age were better predictors for trauma mortality comparted with ISS in our young population. A large global multi-centric study could possibly define an accurate global formula that uses both anatomical and physiological variables for predicting trauma mortality.", "doi": "10.1007/s00068-017-0830-6", "title": "Searching for mortality predictors in trauma patients: a challenging task.", "journal": ["European journal of trauma and emergency surgery : official publication of the European Trauma Society", "Eur J Trauma Emerg Surg"]}
