Neurosurgical intervention data were collected at 7 d postrandomization. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine associations.There were 372 (13%) patients with large ICH volume (>30 mL), which was associated with nonresiding in China, nondiabetic status, severe neurological deficit (National Institutes of Health stroke scale [NIHSS] score \u2265 15), lobar location, intraventricular hemorrhage extension, raised leucocyte count, and hyponatremia. Significant predictors of those patients who underwent surgery (226 of 3233 patients overall; 83 of 372 patients with large ICH) were younger age, severe neurological deficit (lower Glasgow coma scale score, and NIHSS score \u2265 15), baseline ICH volume > 30 mL, and intraventricular hemorrhage.Early identification of severe ICH, based on age and clinical and imaging parameters, may facilitate neurosurgery and intensive monitoring of patients.", "doi": "10.1093/neuros/nyx129", "title": "Practice Patterns for Neurosurgical Utilization and Outcome in Acute Intracerebral Hemorrhage: Intensive Blood Pressure Reduction in Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage Trials 1 and 2 Studies.", "journal": ["Neurosurgery", "Neurosurgery"]}
