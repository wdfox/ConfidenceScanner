We aimed to assess which of the host and/or bacteria-related features are associated with LA.We conducted a retrospective study from January 2009 to July 2013 in a trauma surgical ICU within a teaching hospital. All adult patients presenting with S.aureus-VAP were included. We compared two groups of patients according to the formation or not of LA concomitantly to S.aureus-VAP.Seventy-nine S.aureus-VAP patients, predominantly males (85%) of rather young age (mean [SD]: 35yr [21-64]) with severe trauma (initial Simplified Acute Score II = 42 [32-52]) related-ICU admission, were included. Among them, 10 (14%) developed LA. Patient's characteristics significantly associated with LA development were: a younger age (p = 0.003), road traffic accidents admission (p = 0.017), head injury (p = 0.002), lower Glasgow Coma Scale (p = 0.009), blunt chest trauma (p = 0.01) pneumothorax (p = 0.01) and lung contusions (p = 0.002). No microbiological factors were significantly associated with LA formation. Abscesses were mostly bilateral, \u22655 cm of diameter and with a posterior location.Our results do not favor a specific virulence of S.aureus, but rather highlight the role of multiple insults to the lung, promoting LA formation. Despite a similar severity score, patients with LA had more serious trauma, combining severe both chest and head insults.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0189249", "title": "The multistep road to ventilator-associated lung abscess: A retrospective study of S.aureus ventilator-associated pneumonia.", "journal": ["PloS one", "PLoS ONE"]}
