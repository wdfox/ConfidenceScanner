Our objectives were to: 1) describe the impact of relevant demographic, impairment and medical complexity variables at rehabilitation admission on R-LOS among adult Canadians with traumatic SCI; and 2) identify factors which extend R-LOS.Data from 1,376 adults with traumatic SCI were obtained via chart abstraction and administrative data linkage from 15 Rick Hansen SCI Registry sites (2004-2014). Variables included age, sex, neurological impairment (level, severity), rehabilitation onset days, R-LOS, Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) at admission, prior ventilation or endotracheal tube (Vent/ETT), or indwelling bladder catheter at acute discharge, pain interference score, intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS), and lower extremity motor scores (LEMS) at rehabilitation admission. Variables related to R-LOS in bivariate analysis were included in multivariate analysis to determine their impact on R-LOS.Prior Vent/ETT tube, indwelling bladder catheter, GCS, LEMS, and neurological impairment were related to R-LOS in bivariate analysis. Multivariate linear regression analyses identified five variables as significant predictors: age, Vent/ETT for >24 hours in acute care, indwelling bladder catheter at acute discharge, LEMS, and NLI/AIS subgroup at rehabilitation admission explained 32% of the variation in R-LOS (p<0.001).Based on the enclosed formula, and knowledge of an individual's age at injury, spinal cord impairment (level and severity), prior Vent/ETT, presence of an indwelling bladder catheter, and LEMS at admission, administrators and clinicians may readily identify patients for whom an extended R-LOS beyond conventional LOS targets is likely.", "doi": "10.1080/10790268.2017.1368962", "title": "Predicting rehabilitation length of stay in Canada: It's not just about impairment.", "journal": ["The journal of spinal cord medicine", "J Spinal Cord Med"]}
