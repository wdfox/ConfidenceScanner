Troponin-T levels were measured at hospital admission, and at 24 h, 48 h, and 72\u00a0h post-cardiac arrest. All available cases were analyzed for troponin-T release.Troponin-T measurements were available from 54 xenon patients and 54 control patients. The baseline characteristics did not differ significantly between the groups. After adjustments for age, sex, study site, primary coronary\u00a0percutaneous intervention (PCI), and norepinephrine dose, the mean \u00b1 SD post-arrival incremental\u00a0change of the ln-transformed troponin-T at 72\u00a0h was 0.79 \u00b1 1.54 in the xenon group and 1.56 \u00b1 1.38 in the control group (adjusted mean difference\u00a0-0.66; 95% confidence interval:\u00a0-1.16 to\u00a0-0.16; p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). The effect of xenon on the change in the troponin-T values did not differ in patients with or without PCI or in those with a diagnosis of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (group by PCI or ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction interaction effect; p\u00a0=\u00a00.86 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.71, respectively).Among comatose survivors of OHCA, in comparison with hypothermia alone, inhaled xenon combined with hypothermia suggested a less severe myocardial injury as demonstrated by the significantly reduced release of troponin-T.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jacc.2017.09.1088", "title": "Inhaled Xenon Attenuates Myocardial Damage in Comatose Survivors of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest: The Xe-Hypotheca Trial.", "journal": ["Journal of the American College of Cardiology", "J.
