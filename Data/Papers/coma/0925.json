Improved inference and prediction accuracy of GBLUP may be achieved by identifying genomic regions enriched for causal genetic variants. We aimed at searching for patterns in GBLUP-derived single-marker statistics, by including them in genetic marker set tests, that could reveal associations between a set of genetic markers (genomic feature) and a complex trait. GBLUP-derived set tests proved to be powerful for detecting genomic features, here defined by gene ontology (GO) terms, enriched for causal variants affecting a quantitative trait in a population with low degree of relatedness. Different set test approaches were compared using simulated data illustrating the impact of trait- and genomic feature-specific factors on detection power. We extended the most powerful single trait set test, covariance association test (CVAT), to a multiple trait setting. The multiple trait CVAT (MT-CVAT) identified functionally relevant GO categories associated with the quantitative trait, chill coma recovery time, in the unrelated, sequenced inbred lines of the Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel.", "doi": "10.1038/s41598-017-02281-3", "title": "Multiple Trait Covariance Association Test Identifies Gene Ontology Categories Associated with Chill Coma Recovery Time in Drosophila melanogaster.", "journal": ["Scientific reports", "Sci Rep"]}
