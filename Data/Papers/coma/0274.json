All causes of CT+ brain injury were present in both SAC groups.A normal GCS score and a SAC score do not exclude the possibility of significant intracranial injury.", "doi": "10.1097/HTR.0000000000000355", "title": "Intracranial Pathology (CT+) in Emergency Department Patients With High GCS and High Standard Assessment of Concussion (SAC) Scores.", "journal": ["The Journal of head trauma rehabilitation", "J Head Trauma Rehabil"]}
