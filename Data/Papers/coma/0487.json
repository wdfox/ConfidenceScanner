Guidelines for optimal management of cryptogenic NORSE are not clearly defined so far in the literature. Other than common medication, use of high-dose steroids, IV immune globulins and plasma exchanges in NORSE of unknown aetiology have been scarcely described. Immunomodulatory therapy like plasmapheresis is based on the fact that a pathological substance exists in the plasma that contributes to the disease process and its symptoms, which gets removed. We report a case of young female patient diagnosed as NORSE who responded to treatment with plasma exchange after becoming refractory to antiepileptic therapy and treatment with anaesthetic agents for recurrent seizers.", "doi": "10.7860/JCDR/2017/29878.10292", "title": "Plasma Exchange as a Therapeutic Modality in a Rare Case of Cryptogenic New Onset Refractory Status Epilepticus (NORSE).", "journal": ["Journal of clinical and diagnostic research : JCDR", "J Clin Diagn Res"]}
