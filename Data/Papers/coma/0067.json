Six months postoperative safety, efficacy and predictability were evaluated. Corneal Scheimpflug topography was measured preoperatively, 1\u00a0day, 3\u00a0months and 6\u00a0months postoperatively. Wavefront aberrations were measured preoperatively, 3\u00a0months and 6\u00a0months postoperatively.Six months postoperatively, LogMAR uncorrected and corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) were -0.013\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.086 and -0.073\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.069, respectively. 73% (97%) of eyes were within 0.5 (1) D of target refraction. No eyes lost CDVA, 43% (13 eyes) gained one line and 7% (two eyes) gained two lines. Mean corneal back curvature (KMB) and posterior central elevation (PCE) did not change significantly comparing preoperative and 6\u00a0months postoperative data (p\u00a0=\u00a00.91 and 0.77, respectively). Comparing 1\u00a0day with 6\u00a0months postoperative data, central corneal thickness (CCT), mean corneal front curvature (KMF), KMB and PCE did not change significantly (p\u00a0=\u00a00.27, 0.07, 0.52, 0.71, respectively). Total higher-order aberration (HOA), spherical aberration and coma increased significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) but trefoil remained stable (p\u00a0=\u00a00.49).Our results indicate that SMILE can correct myopia and myopic astigmatism of over -10\u00a0D predictably. No early ectasia was observed. Long-term changes in visual quality and corneal stability require further investigation.", "doi": "10.1111/aos.13609", "title": "Early visual outcomes and optical quality after femtosecond laser small-incision lenticule extraction for myopia and myopic astigmatism correction of over -10 dioptres.", "journal": ["Acta ophthalmologica", "Acta Ophthalmol"]}
