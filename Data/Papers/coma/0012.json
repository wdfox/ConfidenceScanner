Cricothyrotomy is a potentially lifesaving skill that is used when other airway maneuvers fail. The authors reviewed all transports by a helicopter program in which cricothyrotomy was performed to assess the frequency, success, and technique.This was a retrospective chart review of air medical patient records from an electronic medical record system over a 112-month period.During the study period, 22,434 patients were transported, 13 (.057%) of whom underwent cricothyrotomy. The typical patient was a male trauma victim with a mean Glasgow Coma Score of 5 transported from an accident scene with a mean age of 34.3 years. Six (46%) of the patients were alive at 24 hours. All patients (13/100%) received attempted endotracheal intubation; the mean number of attempts per patient was 2. The success rate was 100% with all patients ventilated via cricothyrotomy.This study shows cricothyrotomy is a rarely performed skill but that HEMS providers are able to successfully learn the skill with proper training and oversight.", "doi": "10.1016/j.amj.2017.10.004", "title": "Cricothyrotomy in Helicopter Emergency Medical Service Transport.", "journal": ["Air medical journal", "Air Med.
