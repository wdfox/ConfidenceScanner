We evaluate the association of implementation of the Canadian CT Head Rule on head CT imaging in community emergency departments (EDs).We conducted an interrupted time-series analysis of encounters from January 2014 to December 2015 in 13 Southern California EDs. Adult health plan members with a trauma diagnosis and Glasgow Coma Scale score at ED triage were included. A multicomponent intervention included clinical leadership endorsement, physician education, and integrated clinical decision support. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients receiving a head CT. The unit of analysis was ED encounter, and we compared CT use pre- and postintervention with generalized estimating equations segmented logistic regression, with physician as a clustering variable. Secondary analysis described the yield of identified head injuries pre- and postintervention.Included were 44,947 encounters (28,751 preintervention and 16,196 postintervention), resulting in 14,633 (32.6%) head CTs (9,758 preintervention and 4,875 postintervention), with an absolute 5.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.5% to 8.1%) reduction in CT use postintervention. Adjusted pre-post comparison showed a trend in decreasing odds of imaging (odds ratio 0.98; 95% CI 0.96 to 0.99). All but one ED reduced CTs postintervention (0.3% to 8.7%, one ED 0.3% increase), but no interaction between the intervention and study site over time existed (P=.34). After the intervention, diagnostic yield of CT-identified intracranial injuries increased by 2.3% (95% CI 1.5% to 3.1%).A multicomponent implementation of the Canadian CT Head Rule was associated with a modest reduction\u00a0in CT use and an increased diagnostic yield of head CTs for adult trauma encounters in community EDs.", "doi": "10.1016/j.annemergmed.2017.06.022", "title": "Implementation of the Canadian CT Head Rule and Its Association With Use of Computed Tomography Among Patients With Head Injury.", "journal": ["Annals of emergency medicine", "Ann Emerg Med"]}
