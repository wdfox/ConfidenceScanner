At present, most organs for transplant in the United States are from donation after neurologic determination of death (brain death). Potential organs for transplant need to maintain their viability during a series of insults, including the original disease, physiologic derangements during the dying process, ischemia, and reperfusion. Proper donor management before, during, and after procurement has potential to increase the number and quality of organs from donors. Anesthesiologists need to understand the physiologic derangements associated with brain death and the updated donor management during the periprocurement period.", "doi": "10.1016/j.anclin.2017.04.003", "title": "Anesthesia Management of Organ Donors.", "journal": ["Anesthesiology clinics", "Anesthesiol Clin"]}
