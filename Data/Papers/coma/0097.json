Changes in arterial blood gases (ABG) and clinical outcomes were compared and corrected for differences in AECOPD severity (Blood urea\u2009>\u20099\u2009mmol/L, Altered mental status (Glasgow coma scale (GCS)\u2009<\u200914), Pulse\u2009>\u2009109\u2009bpm, age\u2009> 65 (BAP-65)) and co-morbidities. An economic analysis was also undertaken.There was no significant difference in age (70\u2009\u00b1\u200910\u2009years), forced expiratory volume in 1\u2009s (FEV1 ) (0.84\u2009\u00b1\u20090.35\u2009L), initial pH (7.29\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08), partial pressure of CO2 in arterial blood (PaCO2 ) (72\u2009\u00b1\u200922\u2009mm\u2009Hg) or BAP-65 scores (2.9\u2009\u00b1\u20091.01) across the three models. The Ward achieved an increase in pH (0.12\u2009\u00b1\u20090.07) and a decrease in PaCO2 (12\u2009\u00b1\u200918\u2009mm\u2009Hg) that was equivalent to HDU and ICU. However, the Ward treated more patients (38 vs 28 vs 15, P <\u20090.001), for a longer duration in the first 24\u2009h (12.3\u2009\u00b1\u20094.8 vs 7.9\u2009\u00b1\u20094.1 vs 8.4\u2009\u00b1\u20095.3\u2009h, P <\u20090.05) and was more cost-effective per treatment day ($AUD 1231\u2009\u00b1\u2009382 vs 1745\u2009\u00b1\u20092673 vs 2386\u2009\u00b1\u20091120, P <\u20090.05) than HDU and ICU. ICU had a longer hospital stay (9\u2009\u00b1\u200911 vs 7\u2009\u00b1 7 vs 13\u2009\u00b1\u200928\u2009days, P <\u20090.002) compared with the Ward and HDU. There was no significant difference in intubation rate or survival.In acute hypercapnic Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients, the Ward model of NIV care achieved equivalent clinical outcomes, whilst being more cost-effective than HDU or ICU models.", "doi": "10.1111/resp.13228", "title": "Models of care for non-invasive ventilation in the Acute COPD Comparison of three Tertiary hospitals (ACT3) study.", "journal": ["Respirology (Carlton, Vic.)", "Respirology"]}
