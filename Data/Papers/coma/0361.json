This study aims to determine and predict if computed tomography (CT) scans alone can be performed without risking oversight of substantial injuries found on follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).This is a retrospective cohort study of 63 blunt trauma patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale of <\u00a08. Data were collated from electronic medical records and included patient demographics, premorbid mobility, mechanism of injury, suspected level of injury and neurological examination findings. Patients were urgently evaluated using CT scans, followed by non-contrast MRI scans within 48\u00a0h of admission. The accuracy of CT scan was evaluated using MRI as a reference. Adjusted multivariable analysis was also performed to identify predictors for findings detected on MRI but not on CT.The mean age of patients was 42.3\u00a0years and 90.5% were males. CT scans had a high specificity of 100% and sensitivity of 87.2%. Predictors of MRI abnormalities include females, patients with relatively milder mechanisms of injury, patients with suspected thoracic spine injury, and CT scan findings of facet dislocation and intracranial haemorrhage. There was no predictor for spinal cord oedema.MRI should be performed in the presence of the aforementioned predictive factors and in the presence of neurological deficits. Otherwise, patients can be treated medically without the fear of missing a substantial cervical injury.", "doi": "10.1007/s00586-017-5317-y", "title": "The utility of magnetic resonance imaging in addition to computed tomography scans in the evaluation of cervical spine injuries: a study of obtunded blunt trauma patients.", "journal": ["European spine journal : official publication of the European Spine Society, the European Spinal Deformity Society, and the European Section of the Cervical Spine Research Society", "Eur Spine J"]}
