Medical records of 29 patients were retrospectively analyzed following a diagnosis of CVST with magnetic resonance venography (MRV) or digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Systemic anticoagulation was the initial treatment in all patients following admission. In group A, stent retriever thrombectomy combined with local thrombolytic therapy was performed on 14 patients who met the criteria of endovascular therapy. Stent-assisted angioplasty was also performed when patients presented with venous sinus stenosis. A total of 15 patients in group B received systemic anticoagulant treatment. Subsequently, warfarin was administered orally for 3 to 12 months as a continuous anticoagulant therapy. International normalized ratio was monitored when patients were receiving anticoagulant therapy. Additionally, clinical presentation, decision to escalate therapy, recanalization, Glasgow Coma Scale, modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and the clinical outcome was assessed. A total of 14 patients (9 female patients, 5 male patients), with ages ranging from 17 to 57 years, met the criteria of endovascular therapy. The clinical symptoms of 12 patients had improved after receiving endovascular therapy and only 2 patients suffered from intracranial hemorrhage following the procedure. Complete recanalization of venous sinus was exhibited in 10/14 (71.4%) patients in group A when compared with 1/15 (6.7%) patients in group B. mRS were improved in the 12-month follow-up in groups A and B when compared with that at admission. In the present study, patients with acute CVST treated with stent retriever thrombectomy combined with local thrombolytic therapy had a favorable outcome. To conclude, the present study provides a treatment option in treating CVST, particularly for patients that present with evident cortical venous outflow stasis or deteriorate neurology, despite appropriate anticoagulant therapy.", "doi": "10.3892/etm.2017.5043", "title": "Stent retriever thrombectomy combined with local thrombolytic therapy for cerebral venous sinus thrombosis: A case report.", "journal": ["Experimental and therapeutic medicine", "Exp Ther Med"]}
