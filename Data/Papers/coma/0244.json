Autologous ADASC were obtained by elective liposuction and cultured onto both sides of the lamina. Five patients received the decellularized lamina alone and four patients the recellularized lamina into a femtosecond-assisted 9.5mm-diameter lamellar pocket under topical anesthesia. Total follow-up was 6 months.No case showed clinical haze or scarring by month 3. Six months after surgery, patients showed a general improvement of all visual parameters, with a mean unaided visual acuity (VA) from 0.109 to 0.232 (p=0.05) and corrected distance VA from 0.22 to 0.356 (p=0.068). Refractive sphere improved in all patients (from -4.55 D to -2.69 D; p=0.017), but refractive cylinder remained stable (from -2.83 to -2.61; p=0.34). An improvement tendency of all anterior keratometric values was observed. A mean improvement of 120 \u03bcm in all thickness parameters was confirmed (p=0.008), as well as an improvement in the spherical aberration (p=0.018), coma (p=0.23) and total higher order aberrations (p=0.31). No significant differences among groups were detected.Decellularized human corneal stromal laminas transplantation seems safe and moderately effective for advanced keratoconus. Potential benefits of its recellularization with autologous ADASC remains unclear.", "doi": "10.1016/j.ajo.2017.10.026", "title": "Corneal Stroma Enhancement with Decellularized Stromal Laminas with or without Stem Cell Recellularization for Advanced Keratoconus.", "journal": ["American journal of ophthalmology", "Am.
