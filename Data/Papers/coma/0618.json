Visual acuity, corneal topography, contrast sensitivity (CS), and wavefront aberrations were recorded preoperatively and compared with postoperative measurements. Objective scatter index (OSI) and modulation transfer function (MTF) cut-off frequency were measured 1 year postoperatively.One year postoperatively, the two groups demonstrated no significant difference in the CS at all spatial frequencies. The increments of higher-order aberrations (HOAs) (HOA = 0.583 \u00b1 0.210 \u03bcm), including spherical aberration (SA) (SA = 0.546 \u00b1 0.249 \u03bcm), were higher (P < 0.05) in the LASEK group than those in the SMILE group (HOA = 0.451 \u00b1 0.143 \u03bcm; SA = 0.450 \u00b1 0.340 \u03bcm) after surgery. There were no significant differences in the increments of coma and trefoil aberrations between the two groups. The OSI and MTF cut-off frequency exhibited no significant differences between the two groups postoperatively. No vision-threatening complications were noted at any stage in either group.Both LASEK and SMILE are safe and effective surgical options for the correction of high myopia. SMILE has a lower HOAs and SA induction rate 1 year postoperatively.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0182251", "title": "Comparison of postoperative visual quality after SMILE and LASEK for high myopia: A 1-year outcome.", "journal": ["PloS one", "PLoS ONE"]}
