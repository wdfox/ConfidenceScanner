Treatments, both physical and psychological, have come and some have been discarded. There have been radical changes in the delivery of care, from the 2000-bed Victorian asylum to community care, and the on the whole beneficial impact of legislation such as mental health Acts and Acts dealing with suicide, abortion and sexual offences. His experience has warned him of the folly of overenthusiasm for some treatments - such as deep insulin for schizophrenia, psycho surgery, and even classical psychoanalysis which can become as addictive as any drug or a promise of salvation as convincing as a religion. On the other hand, a treatment involving passing electric shocks through the brain has stood the test of time and may be life saving for some patients.", "doi": "10.1177/0025817217721381", "title": "Sixty years in psychiatry.", "journal": ["The Medico-legal journal", "Med Leg J"]}
