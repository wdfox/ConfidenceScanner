Transfer is costly, inconvenient, and potentially risky in inclement weather. We propose that previously-published brain injury guidelines (BIG)1 can help to determine which patients could avoid mandatory transfer.Retrospective chart review of patients transferred between January 2012 and December 2013 was performed. Patients were classified as having minor (BIG 1), moderate (BIG 2), or severe (BIG 3) head injuries based on previously-published guidelines. Patient characteristics and outcomes were compared.No BIG 1 patients deteriorated or required surgical intervention. One BIG 2 patient required a non-emergent operation and another was readmitted with a worsened injury. In the BIG 3 group, 11.9% required neurosurgical procedures and 20% died.The BIG classification can help stratify patients for whom transfer is considered.", "doi": "10.1016/j.amjsurg.2017.09.002", "title": "Not every trauma patient with a radiographic head injury requires transfer for neurosurgical evaluation: Application of the brain injury guidelines to patients transferred to a level 1 trauma center.", "journal": ["American journal of surgery", "Am.
