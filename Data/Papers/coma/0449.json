Primary endpoints were in-hospital 30-day mortality and extended Glasgow outcome score (GOSE) at 3 years. Association with the intensity of monitoring and outcome was studied by comparing a high level of monitoring (HLM) (systemic and \u22653 specific monitoring) and low level of monitoring (LLM) (systemic and 0-2 specific monitoring) and using inverse probability weighting procedure.476 patients were included and IPW was used to improve the balance between the two groups of treatments (HLM/LMM). Overall hospital mortality (at 30 days) was 43%, being significantly lower in HLM than LLM group (27% vs. 53%: RR, 1.63: 95% CI: 1.23-2.15). The 14-day hospital mortality was also lower in the HLM group than expected, based upon the CRASH prediction model (35%). At 3 years, disability was not significantly different between the monitoring groups.After adjustment, HLM group improved short-term mortality but did not show any improvement in the 3-year outcome compared with LLM.", "doi": "10.1080/02699052.2017.1370554", "title": "Impact of extended monitoring-guided intensive care on outcome after severe traumatic brain injury: A prospective multicentre cohort study (PariS-TBI study).", "journal": ["Brain injury", "Brain Inj"]}
