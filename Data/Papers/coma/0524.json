An example of such an outcome is any AE. These types of outcomes treat AEs with different clinical significance (eg, death, urinary tract infection) similarly. We conducted a study to address this shortcoming in research methodology by creating a single severity-weighted outcome that can be used to characterize the overall severity of a given patient's postoperative course. All orthopedic faculty members at 2 academic institutions were invited to complete a severity-weighting exercise in which AEs were assigned a percentage severity of death. Mean (standard error) severity weight for urinary tract infection was 0.23% (0.08%); blood transfusion, 0.28% (0.09%); pneumonia, 0.55% (0.15%); hospital readmission, 0.59% (0.23%); wound dehiscence, 0.64% (0.17%); deep vein thrombosis, 0.64% (0.19%); superficial surgical-site infection, 0.68% (0.23%); return to operating room, 0.91% (0.29%); progressive renal insufficiency, 0.93% (0.27%); graft/prosthesis/flap failure, 1.20% (0.34%); unplanned intubation, 1.38% (0.53%); deep surgical-site infection, 1.45% (0.38%); failure to wean from ventilator, 1.45% (0.48%); organ/space surgical-site infection, 1.76% (0.46%); sepsis without shock, 1.77% (0.42%); peripheral nerve injury, 1.83% (0.47%); pulmonary embolism, 2.99% (0.76%); acute renal failure, 3.95% (0.85%); myocardial infarction, 4.16% (0.98%); septic shock, 7.17% (1.36%); stroke, 8.73% (1.74%); cardiac arrest requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation, 9.97% (2.46%); and coma, 15.14% (3.04%).
