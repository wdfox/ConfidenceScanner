A brain computed tomography scan showed remarkable fusiform dilatation with elongation of basilar artery, with compressive effect on brain stem. Autopsy confirmed existence of vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia, with organized old thrombus and partially with recent occlusive thrombosis. The histology and immunohistochemical staining were showing a loss of the elastic tissue with significant fibrosis in the tunica media and small groups of foam macrophages and cholesterol crystals in atherosclerotic plaque.We presented a case of dolichoectasia of vertebrobasilar artery with an obstructive hydrocephalus, due to direct compression on pons and midbrain, which is an extremely rare entity. This case had been analyzed during the patient's life through clinical, laboratory, and radiology examinations and after he died through autopsy.", "doi": "10.1097/PAF.0000000000000348", "title": "Dolichoectasia of Vertebrobasilar Arteries as a Cause of Hydrocephalus and Ischemic Cerebral Stroke.", "journal": ["The American journal of forensic medicine and pathology", "Am J Forensic Med Pathol"]}
