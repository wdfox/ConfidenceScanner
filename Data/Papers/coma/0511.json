Improving organ quality by implementing a selective organ protective donor management could be the first step towards a graft of enhanced quality. However, the molecular mechanisms of such treatments are still poorly understood. Glucocorticoid medication in donor medicine has been carried out and discussed for a long time. In a recent study published in Clinical Science, Jim\u00e9nez-Castro et al. [Clin. Sci. (2017) 131, 733-746] demonstrate how liver histology and transplant liver function can be improved by administration of glucocorticoids to brain-dead donor rats with steatotic livers. This work illustrates the need for further trials in order to selectively improve the quality of steatotic livers with a potential for liver transplantation.", "doi": "10.1042/CS20170178", "title": "Understanding the effect of corticosteroid pretreatment in brain-dead organ donors: new mechanistic insights for improvement of organ quality in liver transplantation.", "journal": ["Clinical science (London, England : 1979)", "Clin.
