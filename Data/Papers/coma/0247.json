There are no studies about the SICH mortality in southern Portugal. The objective of this study was to describe the predictors of 30-day in-hospital SICH mortality in Algarve, the southernmost region of Portugal.Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of in-hospital death. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate survival over time based on SICH severity.Of the 549 cases, 349 (63.6%) were men; the mean age was 71.4 years. Two hundred seventeen patients (39.5%) did not receive stroke unit (SU) care. The 30-day mortality was 34.4%. Independent predictors of death were older age (odds ratio [OR]\u2009=\u20091.096, 95% confidence interval [CI]\u2009=\u20091.031-2.062, P\u2009=\u2009.022) per additional year, vitamin K antagonists use (OR\u2009=\u20095.464, 95% CI\u2009=\u20092.088-25.714, P\u2009=\u2009.043), admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 8 or lower (OR\u2009=\u200920.511, 95% CI\u2009=\u20097.862-62.168, P\u2009<\u2009.0001) or GCS score of 9-12 (OR\u2009=\u200912.709, 95% CI\u2009=\u20093.078-44.113, P\u2009<\u2009.0001), hematoma volume (OR\u2009=\u20091.037, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.004-1.071, P\u2009=\u2009.028) per additional milliliter, intraventricular dissection (OR\u2009=\u20091.916, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.105-4.566, P\u2009=\u2009.046), and pneumonia (OR 12.918, 95% CI\u2009=\u20094.603-24.683, P\u2009<\u2009.0001). SU care was independently associated with reduction of death (OR .395, 95% CI\u2009=\u2009.126-.635, P\u2009=\u2009.004). Severity correlated with short time to death (P\u2009<\u2009.0001). Sixty-five of the patients (39.2%) died after the seventh day of SICH (\"non-neurological deaths\").The in-hospital 30-day mortality is high in the region. Admitting more patients to the SU and implementation of preventive strategies of complications can reduce mortality.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2017.09.006", "title": "Short-Term Outcome of Spontaneous Intracerebral Hemorrhage in Algarve, Portugal: Retrospective Hospital-Based Study.", "journal": ["Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association", "J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis"]}
