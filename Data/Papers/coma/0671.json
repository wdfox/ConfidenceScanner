The purpose of this study was to assess trends in medication errors in trauma patients and the role these errors play in patient outcomes. Injured adults admitted from 2009 to 2015 to a Level I trauma center were included. Medication errors were determined based on a nurse-driven, validated, and prospectively maintained database. Multivariable logistic regression modeling was used to control for differences between groups. Among 15,635 injured adults admitted during the study period, 132 patients experienced 243 errors. Patients who experienced errors had significantly worse injury severity, lower Glasgow Coma Scale scores and higher rates of hypotension on admission, and longer lengths of stay. Before adjustment, mortality was similar between groups but morbidity was higher in the medication error group. After risk adjustment, there were no significant differences in morbidity or mortality between the groups. Medication errors in trauma patients tend to occur in significantly injured patients with long hospital stays. Appropriate adjustment when studying the impact of medical errors on patient outcomes is important.", "doi": null, "title": "Medication Errors in Injured Patients.", "journal": ["The American surgeon", "Am Surg"]}
