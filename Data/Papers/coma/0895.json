But the BBB permeability at the late stage of acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) patients is uncertain. We aimed to assess the BBB permeability of spontaneous basal ganglia ICH using computed tomographic perfusion (CTP) and investigates its relationship with hematoma and perihematomal edema volume.We performed CTP on 54 consecutive ICH patients within 24 to 72\u00a0h after symptom onset. Permeability-surface area product (PS) derived from CTP imaging was measured in hematoma, \"high-PS spot,\" perihematoma, normal-appearing, hemispheric, and contralateral regions. Hematoma and edema volumes were calculated from non-contrast CT.\"High-PS spot\" and perihematoma regions had higher PS than the contralateral regions (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Hematoma PS was lower than that in the contralateral regions (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Perihematoma PS of the large-hematoma group was higher than that of the small-hematoma group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.011). Perihematomal edema volume correlated positively with hematoma volume (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.864, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and perihematoma PS (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.478, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Perihematoma PS correlated positively with hematoma volume (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.373, p\u00a0=\u00a00.005).Locally elevated perihematoma PS was found in most spontaneous basal ganglia ICH patients within 24 to 72\u00a0h after symptom onset. Perihematoma PS was higher in larger hematomas and was associated with larger edema volume. At this period, BBB leakage is likely to be an important factor in edema formation.", "doi": "10.1007/s00234-017-1852-9", "title": "Quantitative assessment on blood-brain barrier permeability of acute spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage in basal ganglia: a CT perfusion study.", "journal": ["Neuroradiology", "Neuroradiology"]}
