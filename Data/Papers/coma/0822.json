A young woman experienced a cardiac arrest and was subsequently determined to be approximately 20 weeks pregnant following cardio pulmonary resuscitation. Soon after, she was diagnosed as brain dead, but her family chose to keep her supported in hopes of the delivery of a healthy child. She was transferred to our facility, where she was supported after being diagnosed as brain dead for a total of 90 days and delivered a healthy baby boy at almost 32 weeks gestational age. Following delivery, the pregnant patient expired per brain death protocol. The following case report outlines the details of her care and the outcome of our somatic support to share and collaborate with other healthcare professionals caring for this rare patient population.", "doi": "10.1016/j.hrtlng.2017.05.008", "title": "Somatic support following cardiac arrest for 90\u00a0days leading to a healthy baby boy: A case report.", "journal": ["Heart & lung : the journal of critical care", "Heart Lung"]}
