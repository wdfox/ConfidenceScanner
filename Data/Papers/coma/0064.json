All adult patients (\u226516\u00a0years old) who sustained an isolated severe blunt TBI and were transported by HEMS or GEMS were included in the study.There were 145,559 patients who met the inclusion criteria. Overall, 116,391 (80%) patients were transported via GEMS and 29,168 (20%) via HEMS. Median transportation time was longer for HEMS patients (41 vs. 25\u00a0min; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). HEMS patients were more likely to have hypotension (2.7% vs. 1.5%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score\u00a0<\u00a09 (38.2% vs. 10.9%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and head Abbreviation Injury Scale (AIS) score of 5 (20.1% vs. 9.7%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Stepwise logistic regression analysis identified age \u2265 65\u00a0years old, male sex, hypotension, GCS score < 9, prehospital intubation, and head AIS scores 4 and 5 as independent predictors of mortality. Helicopter transportation was independently associated with improved survival (odds ratio [OR] 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.47-0.67; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Admission to a Level I trauma center was an independent predictor of survival (OR 0.64; 95% CI 0.53-0.82; p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). Regardless of head AIS, helicopter transport was an independent predictor of survival (AIS 3: OR 0.35; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001; AIS 4: OR 0.44; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001; AIS 5: OR 0.76; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). A prolonged transport time was not an independent predictor of mortality.Helicopter transport, in adult patients with\u00a0isolated severe TBI, is associated with improved survival.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jemermed.2017.11.019", "title": "Air Versus Ground Transportation in Isolated Severe Head Trauma: A National Trauma Data Bank Study.", "journal": ["The Journal of emergency medicine", "J Emerg Med"]}
