Of the remaining 21,745 patients without EMS-assessed risk, 166 were diagnosed with AAS. Therefore, the sensitivity and specificity of our EMS-risk assessment for AAS was 54.0% (195/361) and 99.4% (21,579/21,714), respectively. EMS assessed the risk less frequently when patients were elderly and presented with dyspnea and syncope/faintness. Sign of upper extremity ischemia was rarely detected (6.9%) and absence of this sign was associated with lack of EMS-assessed risk. The calculation of modified aortic dissection detection risk score revealed that rigorous assessment based on this score may increase the EMS sensitivity for AAS. The 1-month survival rate was significantly higher in patients admitted to core hospitals with surgical teams for AAS than in those admitted to all other hospitals [87.5% (210/240) vs 69.4% (84/121); P<0.01]. Multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that Stanford type A, Glasgow coma scale \u226414, and admission to core hospitals providing emergency cardiovascular surgery were associated with 1-month survival.Improvement of AAS survival is likely to be affected by rapid admission to appropriate hospitals providing cardiovascular surgery.", "doi": "10.1016/j.ajem.2017.12.005", "title": "The impact of prehospital assessment and EMS transport of acute aortic syndrome patients.", "journal": ["The American journal of emergency medicine", "Am J Emerg Med"]}
