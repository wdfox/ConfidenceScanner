At present, there are well-defined flexible neuroendoscopic procedures to treat ventricular and subarachnoid space pathologies. Neurocysticercosis is recognized as a common cause of neurologic disease in developing countries and the United States. Surgical intervention, especially cerebrospinal fluid diversion, is the key for management of hydrocephalus. In 2002, a consensus suggested that ventricular forms should be treated with endoscopy as the first option.Here, we present the case of a 51-year-old right-handed male, from Estado de M\u00e9xico. Two days before admission he experienced holocraneal headache 7/10 on the visual analogue scale which was intermittent, with no response to any medication, sudden worsening of pain to 10/10, nausea, and vomit. On physical examination, he presented with 14 points in the Glasgow coma scale (M6, O4, V4), pupils were 3 mm, there was adequate light-reflex response, and bilateral papilledema. The cranial nerves did not have other pathological responses, extremities had adequate strength of 5/5, and normal reflexes (++/++) were noted. Neuroimaging studies showed dilatation of the four ventricles as well as a cystic lesion in the fourth ventricle. Surgical position was Concorde, and the approach through a suboccipital burr hole was planned preoperatively with craneometric points. A rigid Karl Storz Hopkins II\u00ae endoscope was inserted directly through the cerebellum and the cystic lesion was extracted entirely.This article presents a useful technique with low morbidity and mortality. Further investigation is needed, especially in our Mexico, where neuroendoscopical techniques are still in the development phase.", "doi": "10.4103/sni.sni_251_17", "title": "Fourth ventricle neurocysticercosis: Rigid endoscopic management.
