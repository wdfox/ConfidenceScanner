'Post-traumatic amnesia' (PTA) comprises orientation, anterograde amnesia (AA) and retrograde amnesia (RA). However, RA is often disregarded in formalized PTA assessment. Drugs can potentially confound PTA assessment: e.g. midazolam can cause AA. However, potential drug confounders are also often disregarded in formalized PTA testing. One study of medium-stay elective-surgery orthopaedic patients (without TBI) demonstrated AA in 80% taking opiates after general anesthesia. However, RA was not assessed. Opiates/opioids are frequently administered after TBI. We compared AA and RA in short-stay orthopaedic surgery in-patients (without TBI) taking post-operative opioids after opiate/opioid/benzodiazepine-free spinal anesthesia. In a prospective cohort, the Westmead PTA Scale (WPTAS) was used to assess AA (WPTAS<12), whilst RA was assessed using the Galveston Orientation and Amnesia Test RA item. Results were obtained in n=25 (60\u00b114yrs, M:F 17:8). Surgery was uncomplicated: all were discharged by Day-4. All were taking regular oxycodone as a new post-operative prescription. Only one co-administered non-opioid was potentially confounding (temezepam, n=4). Of 25, 14 (56%) demonstrated AA: five (20%) were simultaneously disorientated. Mean WPTAS was 11.08\u00b11.22. RA occurred in 0%.AA and disorientation, but not RA, were associated with in-patients (without TBI) taking opioids. Caution should therefore be applied in assessing AA/orientation in TBI in-patients taking opioids. By contrast, retrograde memory was robust and more reliable: even in older patients with iatrogenic AA and disorientation. RA assessment should therefore be integral to assessing TBI severity in all formalized PTA and GCS testing.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jocn.2017.06.027", "title": "Anterograde amnesia and disorientation are associated with in-patients without traumatic brain injury taking opioids.
