She was initially treated medically, but developed delayed secondary refractory intracranial hypertension and bilaterally dilated, non-reactive pupils for 12 h. Wide decompressive craniectomy and dural incisions were performed. The patient presented gradual improvement in her clinical condition [Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 13/15]. Delayed recurring infections lead to the patient's death due to sepsis after 3 months.In light of recent studies, lasting bilateral mydriasis may not always be considered a decisive factor for non-escalation of treatment, as variability among TBI patients and outcomes has been demonstrated. Wide decompressive craniectomy is viable for controlling refractory intracranial hypertension in hemodynamically stable patients.", "doi": "10.4103/sni.sni_299_17", "title": "Lasting bilateral mydriasis after traumatic brain injury may not always be a lost case.", "journal": ["Surgical neurology international", "Surg Neurol Int"]}
