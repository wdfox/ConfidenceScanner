After 3\u2009hours of admission, the patient developed sudden onset tachycardia with hypotension. Cardiac evaluation showed raised creatine kinase MB isoenzyme was elevated; ECG and two-dimensional echocardiography findings were suggestive of myocarditis. Subsequently, she developed transient ventricular tachycardia before developing abrupt onset, right hemiplegia, global aphasia and progressive worsening of sensorium 12\u2009hours after the bite. MRI of brain revealed massive left middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory infarct. The magnetic resonance angiography showed non-visualisation of left internal carotid artery (ICA) and MCA. Coagulation parameters were normal. Sudden complete occlusion of left ICA was probably secondary to cardioembolic phenomenon leading to massive infarct. Despite aggressive medical and supportive measures, she clinically worsened rapidly to Glasgow Coma Scale of 3/15 over next 6\u2009hours and succumbed to her illness the next day.", "doi": "10.1136/bcr-2017-221606", "title": "Scorpion bite-induced ischaemic stroke.", "journal": ["BMJ case reports", "BMJ Case Rep"]}
