In total, 16 patients (5 MCS and 11 VS/UWS) with chronic DOC were included. All patients received active 10\u2009Hz rTMS at the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), at one session per day, for 20 consecutive days. A single daily session of stimulation consisted of 1,000 pulses (10\u2009s of 10\u2009Hz trains; repeated 10 times with an inter-train interval of 60\u2009s; and 11\u2009min and 40\u2009s for total session). The main outcome measures were changes in the total score on the JFK Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) scale. Additional measures were the impressions of caregivers after the conclusion of the interventions, which were assessed using the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) scale.The CRS-R scores were increased in all 5 MCS patients and 4 of 11 VS/UWS patients, while a significant enhancement of CRS-R scores was observed compared to the baseline in all participants (p\u2009=\u20090.007). However, the improvement was more notable in MCS patients (p\u2009=\u20090.042) than their VS/UWS counterparts (p\u2009=\u20090.066). Based on the CGI-I scores, two patients improved considerably, two improved, six minimally improved, six experienced no change, and none deteriorated. Good concordance was seen between the CGI-I result and the increases in CRS-R scores.Treatment of 10\u2009Hz multisession rTMS applied to the left DLPFC is promising for the rehabilitation of DOC patients, especially those in MCS. Further validation with a cohort of a larger sample size is required.", "doi": "10.3389/fneur.2017.00182", "title": "Effects of 10 Hz Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation of the Left Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex in Disorders of Consciousness.", "journal": ["Frontiers in neurology", "Front Neurol"]}
