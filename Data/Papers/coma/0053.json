Cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) was assessed within 24\u00a0h of trauma and daily thereafter through death, discharge, or hospital day 8, whichever came first. Twelve months from injury, participants completed neurodevelopmental testing.Sixty-nine patients were enrolled. Low flow velocities (<\u20092 SD below age/gender normal) were found in 6% (n\u2009=\u20094). No patient with a single low CBFV measurement had a good neurologic outcome (Pediatric Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E Peds)\u2009\u2264\u20094)). Normal flow velocities (\u00b1\u20092 SD around age/gender normal) were seen in 43% of participants (n\u2009=\u200930). High flow velocities (>\u20092 SD above age and gender normal with a Lindegaard ratio (LR) <\u20093) were identified in 23% of children (n\u2009=\u200916), and vasospasm (>\u20092 SD above age/gender normal with LR \u2265\u20093) was identified in 28% (n\u2009=\u200919). Children with good outcomes based on GOS-E Peds scoring were more likely to have had normal flow velocity than other flow patterns. No other differences in neurodevelopmental outcomes were noted.Individual patient responses to TBI in terms of CBFV alterations were heterogeneous. Low flow was uniformly associated with a poor outcome. Patients with good outcomes were more likely to have normal flow. This suggests CBFV may serve as a prognostic indicator in children with TBI. Future studies are needed to determine if aberrant CBFVs are also a therapeutic target.", "doi": "10.1007/s00381-017-3693-6", "title": "Relationships between cerebral flow velocities and neurodevelopmental outcomes in children with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury.", "journal": ["Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery", "Childs Nerv Syst"]}
