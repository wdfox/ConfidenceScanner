Age, gender, PDW, and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores were measured. These patients were divided into two groups based on their 30-day outcomes. Receiver operating curves (ROCs) were generated to identify predictors of 30-day mortality.One hundred twenty patients with traumatic brain injury were enrolled in this study, 89 males (74.2%) and 31 females (25.8%) with a median age of 49.5 (19 - 89) years. The in-hospital mortality rate was 10.8% (n = 13). PDW levels in non-surviving patients were higher than in surviving patients. The higher the PDW, the lower the GSC score. The area under the curve (AUC) for PDW levels with regard to predicting 30-day mortality was 0.88 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.78 to 0.97; p < 0.001). There was correlation between PDW level and GCS score (r = -0.30, 95% confidence interval (CI), - 0.46 to - 0.13; p < 0.001).PDW levels were associated with injury severity and mortality in patients with severe TBI.", "doi": null, "title": "Level of Platelet Distribution Width and Outcome Prediction in Patients with Traumatic Brain Injury.", "journal": ["Clinical laboratory", "Clin.
