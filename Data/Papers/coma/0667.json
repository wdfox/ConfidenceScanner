Patient 2: A 39-year-old woman became deep coma because of cerebellar hemorrhage after hepatic surgery. Scalp-recorded digital electroencephalography (EEG) showed electrocerebral inactivity in both cases. In addition, both EEG showed repetitive discharges at bilateral frontopolar electrodes in response to photic stimuli. The amplitude and latency of the discharges was 17\u2005\u03bcV and 24\u2005msec in case 1, and 9\u2005\u03bcV and 27\u2005msec in case 2 respectively. The activity at left frontopolar electrode disappeared after coverage of the ipsilateral eye. Based on these findings, we could exclude the possibility of brainstem response and judged it as electroretinogram (ERG). Photic stimulation is a useful activation method in EEG recording, and we can also evaluate brainstem function by checking photic blink reflex if it is evoked. However, we should be cautious about the distinction of ERG from photic blink reflex when brain death is clinically suspected.", "doi": "10.5692/clinicalneurol.cn-001049", "title": "Electroretinogram (ERG) to photic stimuli should be carefully distinct from photic brainstem reflex in patients with deep coma.", "journal": ["Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology", "Rinsho Shinkeigaku"]}
