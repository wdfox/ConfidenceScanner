In this retrospective observational study of 40 patients with post-neurosurgical meningitis and ventriculitis due to CRAB, 33 patients without concomitant infection received appropriate dosage regimens of IV colistin. Seventeen of the 33 patients received additional ITH/IVT colistin and 16 patients received only IV colistin. The 14-day, 30-day, and in-hospital morality rates were nominally lower for those who received ITH/IVT colistin (24% vs 38%, 29% vs 56%, 29% vs 56%, respectively). The costs of treatment, lengths of hospital/ICU stay, and ventilator days were significantly shorter among those who received ITH/IVT colistin than those who did not receive ITH/IVT colistin. The initial Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores were associated with 30-day mortality with odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of 1.21 (1.08, 1.46) and 0.77 (0.44, 0.85), respectively. Chemical meningitis from ITH/IVT colistin was mild and resolved spontaneously. The treatment of post-neurosurgical CRAB meningitis and ventriculitis with ITH/IVT colistin as an adjunct to IV colistin was associated with shorter length of hospital/ICU stay and a trend to lower mortality, especially among severely ill patients.", "doi": "10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2017.12.002", "title": "Outcomes of adjunctive therapy with intrathecal or intraventricular administration of colistin for post-neurosurgical meningitis and ventriculitis due to carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii.", "journal": ["International journal of antimicrobial agents", "Int.
