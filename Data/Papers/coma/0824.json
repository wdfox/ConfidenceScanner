The presence and severity of clinical symptoms depends on the degree of stenosis, the location of stenosis, the speed of development of stenosis, and existing collateral flow. Acute complete occlusion of the SVC frequently leads to poor neurologic outcomes such as coma or death. We report a case of a patient who had complete neurologic recovery after 26 minutes of acute total occlusion of the SVC. This report highlights the importance of meticulous management during acute SVC occlusion to improve patient outcome.", "doi": "10.1016/j.athoracsur.2017.02.050", "title": "Complete Neurological Recovery After Acute Total Occlusion of the Superior Vena Cava.", "journal": ["The Annals of thoracic surgery", "Ann.
