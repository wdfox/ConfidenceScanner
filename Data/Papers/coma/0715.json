Vilazodone is an SSRI with partial agonism at the 5-HT1A receptor with demonstrated clinical efficacy for depression whose off-label usage is likely to increase. Recent evidence suggests that unintentional ingestion of vilazodone in children under 6 years old is associated with more severe clinical effects than other SSRIs. We chose to evaluate dose and outcomes for pediatric vilazodone ingestions.A retrospective analysis of single-substance exposures associated with vilazodone among children younger than 6 years of age from 2011 through 2016 was conducted using data from the National Poison Data System.During 2011-2016, 753 vilazodone ingestions among children <6 years old were reported to US poison control centers. A near majority (49.0%, n\u2009=\u2009369) experienced one or more clinical effects. The dose ingested was reported for 596 children (79%). The median dose associated with major effects was 50.0mg (Mean: 106.0) compared with 40.0mg (Mean 81.1) for moderate effects. Half (50.0%) of children with a major effect and 54.0% with a moderate effect ingested \u226440\u2009mg of vilazodone. As the dose of vilazodone ingested increased, the proportions of exposures admitted to a healthcare facility (HCF) (p\u2009<\u2009.001) and with serious outcomes (p\u2009<\u2009.001) both increased. Children \u22642 years had higher proportions of HCF admission (33.8% vs 23.1%) and serious outcomes (27.0% vs 17.7%) than children 3-5 years of age. Clinical effects, such as coma, seizures, ataxia, and hallucinations/delusions, were observed among children ingesting doses of vilazodone as low as 10\u2009mg.Exposure to vilazodone poses a unique and potentially serious threat to children <6 years of age. Children in this age group who are exposed to vilazodone should be evaluated promptly in a clinical setting. Off-label use of vilazodone in children under 6 years should be discouraged until further research is conducted regarding its safety in this population.", "doi": "10.1080/15563650.2017.1347263", "title": "Evaluation of dose and outcomes for pediatric vilazodone ingestions.", "journal": ["Clinical toxicology (Philadelphia, Pa.)", "Clin Toxicol (Phila)"]}
