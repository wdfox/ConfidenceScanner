The choice of surgical or conservative treatment for patients with HICH remains controversial. In recent years, minimally invasive surgeries, such as endoscopic evacuation and stereotactic aspiration, have been attempted for haematoma removal and offer promise. However, research evidence on the benefits of endoscopic evacuation or stereotactic aspiration is still insufficient.A multicentre, randomised controlled trial will be conducted to compare the efficacy of endoscopic evacuation, stereotactic aspiration and craniotomy in the treatment of supratentorial HICH. About 1350 eligible patients from 10 neurosurgical centres will be randomly assigned to an endoscopic group, a stereotactic group and a craniotomy group at a 1:1:1 ratio. Randomisation is undertaken using a 24-h randomisation service accessed by telephone or the Internet. All patients will receive the corresponding surgery based on their grouping. They will be followed-up at 1, 3 and 6\u00a0months after surgery. The primary outcome is the modified Rankin Scale at 6-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes include: haematoma clearance rate; Glasgow Coma Scale 7\u00a0days after surgery; rebleeding rate; intracranial infection rate; hospitalisation time; mortality at 1\u00a0month and 3\u00a0months after surgery; the Barthel Index and the WHO quality of life at 3\u00a0months and 6\u00a0months after surgery.The trial aims to investigate whether endoscopic evacuation and stereotactic aspiration could improve the outcome of supratentorial HICH compared with craniotomy. The trial will help to determine the best surgical method for the treatment of supratentorial HICH.ClinicalTrials.gov, ID: NCT02811614 .
