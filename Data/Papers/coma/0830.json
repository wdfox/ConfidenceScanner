Total higher-order aberrations (tHOA), vertical coma ((Equation is included in full-text article.)), horizontal coma ((Equation is included in full-text article.)), and spherical aberration ((Equation is included in full-text article.)) were measured preoperatively and at postoperative 3 months.At the end of 3 months, tHOA changed significantly compared with the preoperative values (P < 0.05), except for (Equation is included in full-text article.)and (Equation is included in full-text article.)in the low myopia group. The change in (Equation is included in full-text article.), (Equation is included in full-text article.), and (Equation is included in full-text article.)in the moderate group (-0.299, -0.175, and 0.108 \u03bcm) was 2.020, 4.861, and 4.696 times higher than the low group (-0.148, -0.036, 0.023 \u03bcm) (P = 0.002, 0.001, 0.001), respectively. The value in the high group (-0.331, -0.192, 0.154 \u03bcm) was 1.107, 1.097 (P = 0.478, 0.665), and 1.426 times (P = 0.047) higher than the moderate group.
