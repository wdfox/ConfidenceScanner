The purpose of this study was to assess the optimal method of thoracostomy tube removal by comparing party balloon-assisted Valsalva and classic Valsalva techniques. Methods Trauma patients with indications for tube thoracostomy from 2014 to 2015 were recruited. Exclusion criteria were age\u2009<\u200915- or\u2009>\u200964-years-old, history of chronic lung disease, Glasgow Coma Scale\u2009<\u200913, latex allergy, or tracheostomy. Participants were randomly allocated by randomized block design into 4 groups using different Valsalva maneuvers: group A: classic inspired, group B: classic expired, group C: balloon-inspired; and group D: balloon-expired. The primary and secondary outcomes were recurrent pneumothorax and respiratory complications. Results Forty-eight tube thoracostomies were randomized for analysis; 4 patients had bilateral tube thoracostomies. The mean patient age was 38.1\u2009\u00b1\u200919.9 years. The incidence of recurrent pneumothorax confirmed by chest radiography was 15.4% in group A, 16.8% in group B, and none in groups C and D ( p\u2009=\u20090.31). When group A combined with group B was compared with groups C and D, the incidence was 16% vs. 0%, respectively ( p\u2009=\u20090.11). The thoracostomy tube reinsertion rate in all 4 groups was 0%, 8.33%, 0%, and 0%, respectively, which was not significant ( p\u2009=\u20090.38). Conclusions Performing the Valsalva maneuver correctly during full inspiration may be the method of choice for removing thoracostomy tubes. Using a party balloon forces the patient perform the Valsalva maneuver adequately and is simpler to explain.", "doi": "10.1177/0218492317721412", "title": "Randomized controlled trial of chest tube removal aided by a party balloon.", "journal": ["Asian cardiovascular & thoracic annals", "Asian Cardiovasc Thorac Ann"]}
