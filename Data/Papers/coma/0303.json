The incidence of hydrocephalus is greatly reduced in this disconnective procedure when compared with the resective procedure of anatomical hemispherectomy. We describe the occurrence of ipsilateral trapped lateral ventricle months after hemispherotomy for Rasmussen's encephalitis. There is enough evidence to suggest that this rare and interesting complication is due to the local inflammatory changes associated with the surgical trauma.", "doi": "10.1136/bcr-2017-222040", "title": "Trapped ipsilateral lateral ventricle: a delayed complication of hemispherotomy for Rasmussen's encephalitis.", "journal": ["BMJ case reports", "BMJ Case Rep"]}
