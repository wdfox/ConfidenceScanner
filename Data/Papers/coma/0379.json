This review details novel clinical features of NCSE as a manifestation of epilepsy, but one that is underdiagnosed, with the best available evidence. Also, we describe the new concept of epilepsy-related organ dysfunction (Epi-ROD) and a novel electrode and headset which enables prompt electroencephalography.", "doi": "10.12688/f1000research.10939.1", "title": "Novel clinical features of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.", "journal": ["F1000Research", "F1000Res"]}
