Eleven patients underwent acute surgery within 24 hours after the onset, whereas surgery was performed between 3 and 17 days after the onset because of referral delay or associated vasospasm in 5 patients. All patients underwent the same surgical procedure.Elimination of the BBA and patency of the bypass were achieved in all patients. Postoperatively, 2 patients showed small infarction in the Heubner artery area, and 2 others suffered symptomatic vasospasm, but no patient suffered infarction in the posterior communicating/anterior choroidal artery territories. Identically, no patient showed ischemic optic neuropathy. At the last follow-up (mean, 36 months), favorable clinical outcome (good recovery or mild disability in Glasgow Outcome Scale) was achieved in 14 (88%) of the patients without rebleeding or refilling of the aneurysms.Early surgical repair of BBAs by trapping of the affected ICA with high-flow bypass is safe and effective treatment with satisfactory midterm outcome.", "doi": "10.1016/j.wneu.2017.06.033", "title": "Results of Early High-Flow Bypass and Trapping for Ruptured Blood Blister-Like Aneurysms of the Internal Carotid Artery.", "journal": ["World neurosurgery", "World Neurosurg"]}
