Glascow Outcome Scale (GOS) of 4-5 was deemed a good outcome and a GOS 1-3 was deemed to be a poor outcome. Six patients had good outcome at last follow up and 27 patients had poor outcome. Patients with a higher presenting Glascow Coma Scale (GCS) trended towards better outcome [(good: mean 13.1, median 14.5, IQR 12.5-15) vs. (poor: mean 9.6, median 10, IQR 6-14) p\u2009=\u20090.06]. Patients with a higher in-hospital post-operative GCS score had significantly better overall outcome than patients who left the hospital with a lower GCS score [(good: mean 14.5, median 14.5, IQR 14-15) vs. (poor: mean 8.4, median 9, IQR 4-11) p\u2009=\u20090.001]. Patients with a good outcome had a median aSDH thickness of 17mm (IQR 12.75-19.75) while patients with a poor outcome had a median thickness of 20mm (IQR 16-24.5); p\u2009=\u20090.17. In addition, patients with a good outcome had a median midline shift of 10mm (IQR 6-12.5), while patients with a poor outcome had a median midline shift of 14mm (IQR 10-20); p\u2009=\u20090.07.The prognosis for elderly patients with large aSDH remains poor, but a subset of patients can benefit from surgical intervention.", "doi": "10.1080/02688697.2017.1341041", "title": "Surgical evacuation of acute subdural hematoma in octogenarians: a ten-year experience from a single trauma center.", "journal": ["British journal of neurosurgery", "Br J Neurosurg"]}
