In 1-month follow-up, near vision, best corrected distant visual acuity (BCVA), uncorrected distant visual acuity (UDVA), and wavefront aberrations were measured, and compensation factor was calculated.Near vision, UDVA, and BCVA showed no significant difference between ICL V4 implantation and ICL V4c implantation (P\u200a>.05). However, high-order aberrations and spherical aberrations were higher in ICL V4c implantation than in ICL V4 implantation (P\u200a<.05). Low-order aberrations (defocus and astigmatism), coma, and subjective visual quality had no significant difference between ICL V4 implantation and ICL V4c implantation (P\u200a>.05).The 2 kinds of ICL Visian ICL V4 and Visian ICL V4c had similar efficacy of visual quality for high myopia. The presence of the central hole of Visian ICL V4c has no significant effect on visual quality.", "doi": "10.1097/MD.0000000000007294", "title": "Comparison of Implantable Collamer Lens Visian ICL V4 and ICL V4c for high myopia: A cohort study.", "journal": ["Medicine", "Medicine (Baltimore)"]}
