Data were drawn from a larger national study run in Switzerland (2007-2011). Patient assessment: Glasgow Coma Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE), Patient Competency Rating Scale for Neurorehabilitation (PCRS-NR). Relative assessment: Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL; 12-item short form health survey [SF-12]), Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (CISS). Mixed linear models were run separately for ages >50 and \u226450 (i.e. bimodal distribution).Patients' GOSE score was associated with relatives' reported mental SF-12 scores across age (ps < 0.01). Relatives' CISS was associated with patients' PCRS score (age > 50 years): Total and cognitive functioning decreased as emotion-oriented coping increased (ps = 0.01), while interpersonal functioning increased as task-oriented coping increased (p = 0.01) and decreased as avoidance-oriented coping increased (p = 0.02).Patients' functioning and relatives' mental HRQoL and coping strategies are associated with each other.", "doi": "10.1080/02699052.2017.1346295", "title": "Twelve-month prospective cohort study of patients with severe traumatic brain injury and their relatives: Coping, satisfaction with life and neurological functioning.", "journal": ["Brain injury", "Brain Inj"]}
