DCD grafts in particular are associated with ischemic-type biliary lesions (ITBL) with subsequent impaired graft survival rates.Retrospective single-center study of all LT since the start of DCD program (2001-2015). CCI (at hospital discharge and after 6 months) was the result of all complications weighted by their Clavien-Dindo grade. A multiple logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with a complex postoperative course (CCI at 6 months >60).In total, 441 cases were included: 115 DCD and 326 DBD grafts. Median in-hospital CCI was comparable for both groups (DCD 38.2; DBD 36.7; P = 0.429). Six-month postoperative median CCI was significantly higher for DCD grafts (53.4 vs 47.2; P = 0.041). Moreover, more DCD recipients underwent retransplantation for ITBL in this period (4% vs 1%; P = 0.031). Logistic regression identified recipient BMI (P = 0.046), recipient warm ischemia time (odds ratio, OR, 1.032; 95% CI, 1.008-1.056; P = 0.008), and DCD graft (OR 3.913; 95% CI 1.200-12.767; P = 0.024) as risk factors for a CCI >60.This analysis shows a comparable complication rate during the index hospital stay for DCD and DBD LT, but the CCI increases significantly for DCD recipients in 6 months after transplantation. Reduction of biliary complications, especially ITBL, is needed to improve the outcomes for DCD grafts.", "doi": "10.1097/SLA.0000000000002419", "title": "Comparison of Postoperative Outcomes Between Donation After Circulatory Death and Donation After Brain Death Liver Transplantation Using the Comprehensive Complication Index.", "journal": ["Annals of surgery", "Ann.
