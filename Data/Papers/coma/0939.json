Height data describing the posterior corneal shape were fit with Zernike polynomials. Mean values with standard deviations (SD), test-retest variability (coefficient of repeatability [CoR]), and interdevice variability were determined for the defocus Z(2,0), astigmatism Z(2,-2) and Z(2,2), and higher-order terms coma Z(3,-1) and Z(3,1), trefoil Z(3,-3) and Z(3,3), and spherical aberration Z(4,0) coefficients for 5.5\u00a0mm and 8.0\u00a0mm diameters.For the 5.5\u00a0mm diameter, CoRs ranged from 0.3 to 4.3\u00a0\u03bcm with the dual Scheimpflug instrument, 1.6 to 5.2\u00a0\u03bcm with the scanning-slit system, and 0.3 to 2.0\u00a0\u03bcm with the single\u00a0Scheimpflug instrument. The CoR was similar for the Scheimpflug instruments (P\u00a0=\u00a0.43) but poorer for the scanning-slit system (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). The CoRs of the Scheimpflug instruments were smaller than the corresponding population SD for defocus, cardinal astigmatism, coma, and spherical aberration. The scanning-slit system failed to provide 8.0\u00a0mm diameter data. There was a significant bias (interdevice variability) between the Scheimpflug instruments in the higher-order coefficients at both diameters.Repeatability in assessing the posterior corneal shape was generally good for the Scheimpflug instruments but poor for the scanning-slit system. Interdevice variability between the Scheimpflug instruments compromised the interchangeability of higher-order coefficients. For astigmatism, CoR and 95% limits\u00a0of agreement of the Scheimpflug instruments typically corresponded to 0.1 diopter per astigmatism term.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jcrs.2017.03.021", "title": "Posterior corneal shape: Comparison of height data from 3 corneal topographers.", "journal": ["Journal of cataract and refractive surgery", "J Cataract Refract Surg"]}
