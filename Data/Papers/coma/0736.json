Pre- and post-operative root-mean-square (RMS) of total higherorder aberrations in the entire eye, the internal optics and the cornea were 0.350 & 0.257, 0.311 & 0.236 and 0.214 & 0.191 micron (\u03bc), respectively. Also, the magnitude of preoperative total, internal and corneal coma was 0.254 \u03bc \u00d7 222\u00b0, 0.274\u03bc\u00d7242\u00b0 and 0.097\u03bc \u00d7 131\u00b0 and postoperative values were 0.170 \u03bc \u00d7 162\u00b0, 0.131 \u03bc \u00d7 177\u00b0, 0.054 \u03bc \u00d7 125\u00b0, respectively.These results show that sometime the HOAs of the internal optics, mainly crystalline lens, are not compensated by the cornea and this may cause visual discomfort in the absence of any significant cataract, this situation is known as dysfunctional lens syndrome (DLS).", "doi": "10.1007/s10792-017-0622-3", "title": "Dysfunctional lens syndrome.", "journal": ["International ophthalmology", "Int Ophthalmol"]}
