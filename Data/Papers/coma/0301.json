The design of this study is a retrospective cohort study. The SYPTAS was administered to 35 children (26 boys) aged 4.0 to 7.8 years who were consecutively admitted to a children's hospital with mild (n\u2009=\u200926), moderate (n\u2009=\u20093), or severe (n\u2009=\u20097) TBI. Concurrent validity of the SYPTAS was assessed against the Glasgow Coma Scale Scores (GCS). Predictive validity of the SYPTAS for functional outcomes was evaluated against the King's Outcome Scale for Childhood Head Injury (KOSCHI) at discharge and outpatient follow-ups. The length of PTA, measured by the SYPTAS, was invariant of children's chronological age, confirming the scale's developmental validity. Longer PTA was associated with lower GCS, endorsing concurrent validity of PTA duration measured by the SYPTAS, as a clinical indicator of TBI severity. PTA duration measured by the SYPTAS was a significant predictor of functional outcomes on the KOSCHI at discharge and follow-ups. This study provides evidence that the SYPTAS has good developmental, concurrent and predictive validity for assessment of PTA in children aged 4 to 7 years. PTA duration assessed by the SYPTAS is a clinical indicator of TBI severity and can aid rehabilitation planning post TBI.", "doi": "10.1080/21622965.2017.1381100", "title": "Preliminary validation study of the Sydney Post-Traumatic Amnesia Scale (SYPTAS) in children with traumatic brain injury aged 4 to 7 years.", "journal": ["Applied neuropsychology.
