Methods: From January 2011 to December 2016, patients with SeIVH admitted to the General Hospital of the PLA Rocket Force and the Army General Hospital received EVD treatment and were classified as the treatment group. According to intraventricular hemorrhage volume and age, patients received conservative treatment were pair matched and classified as control group. Then we compared the clinical outcome of moderate disability or less degree of discharge (mRS \u22643) and death incidence (mRS 6) between two groups. Results: A total of 361 patients with IVH were treated during these six years. Among them, 75 cases were chosen as treatment group. Another 75 cases were pair matched as control group from 286 cases. At the time of admission, the ventricular hemorrhage volume of two groups were (55.8\u00b122.7) ml and (53.7\u00b123.3) ml (P=0.569) respectively. Cerebral hemorrhage volume were (23.6\u00b15.3) ml and (24.0\u00b15.4) ml (P=0.631). And the median Glasgow coma score (GCS) were 4[IQR(3, 7)] and 5[IQR(4, 7)](P=0.131). At the discharge time, there were 16% (12/75) patients scored mRS\u22643 in treatment group, while 2.7% (2/75) in control group (P<0.005). The absolute risk reduction (ARR) was 13.3%, and the number needed to treat (NNT) was 7.5. The mortality rate of treatment group was 13.3% (10/75), much lower than that of the control group 41.1% (31/75, P<0.001). ARR was 27.8% and NNT was 3.6. Conclusion: Although the prognosis of SeIVH was poor, compared with conservative treatment, EVD treatment significantly improved the outcome of these patients. Randomized controlled trials are needed to validate the efficacy of EVD.\u76ee\u7684\uff1a \u56de\u987e\u6027\u5206\u6790\u91cd\u578b\u8111\u5ba4\u51fa\u8840(SeIVH)\u8111\u5ba4\u5916\u5f15\u6d41(EVD)\u4e0e\u4fdd\u5b88\u6cbb\u7597\u7684\u51fa\u9662\u7ed3\u5c40\u3002 \u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a \u4ece2011\u5e741\u6708\u81f32016\u5e7412\u6708\u5165\u4f4f\u706b\u7bad\u519b\u603b\u533b\u9662\u3001\u9646\u519b\u603b\u533b\u9662\u53ca\u7b2c\u4e09\u519b\u533b\u5927\u5b66\u9644\u5c5e\u65b0\u6865\u533b\u9662\u7684SeIVH\u60a3\u8005\u4e2d\u68c0\u7d22\u63a5\u53d7EVD\u6cbb\u7597\u8005\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6cbb\u7597\u7ec4\uff1b\u5e76\u4ece\u63a5\u53d7\u4fdd\u5b88\u6cbb\u7597\u7684SeIVH\u60a3\u8005\u4e2d\u6839\u636e\u8111\u5ba4\u51fa\u8840\u91cf\u548c\u5e74\u9f84\u6309\u71671\u22361\u968f\u673a\u5339\u914d\u51fa\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u3002\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6cbb\u7597\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u51fa\u9662\u65f6\u53d1\u751f\u4e2d\u5ea6\u53ca\u4ee5\u4e0b\u7a0b\u5ea6\u6b8b\u969c(mRS \u22643\u5206)\u6216\u8005\u6b7b\u4ea1(mRS 6\u5206)\u7684\u7ed3\u5c40\u3002 \u7ed3\u679c\uff1a 6\u5e74\u95f4\u8fde\u7eed\u6536\u6cbb361\u4f8bSeIVH\u60a3\u8005\u3002\u5176\u4e2d75\u4f8b\u4e3a\u6cbb\u7597\u7ec4\uff1b286\u4f8b\u4fdd\u5b88\u6cbb\u7597\u8005\u4e2d\u5339\u914d\u51fa75\u4f8b\u4e3a\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u3002\u5165\u9662\u65f6\u4e24\u7ec4\u8111\u5ba4\u51fa\u8840\u91cf\u5206\u522b\u4e3a(55.8\u00b122.7)ml\u548c(53.7\u00b123.3)ml(P\uff1d0.569)\u3001\u8111\u5b9e\u8d28\u51fa\u8840\u91cf\u5206\u522b\u4e3a(23.6\u00b15.3)ml\u548c(24.0\u00b15.4)ml(P\uff1d0.631)\u3001\u4e2d\u4f4d\u683c\u62c9\u65af\u54e5\u660f\u8ff7\u8bc4\u5206(GCS)\u5206\u522b\u4e3a4(1/4\u548c3/4\u56db\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u5206\u522b\u4e3a3\u548c7)\u548c5(1/4\u548c3/4\u56db\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u5206\u522b\u4e3a4\u548c7)(P\uff1d0.131)\u3002\u51fa\u9662\u65f6\u6cbb\u7597\u7ec4mRS\u22643\u5206\u7684\u60a3\u8005\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4e3a16%(12/75)\uff0c\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u4e3a2.7%(2/75)\uff0c\u4e24\u7ec4\u6bd4\u8f83P<0.005\uff0c\u7edd\u5bf9\u5371\u9669\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e(ARR)\u4e8613.3%\uff0c\u83b7\u76ca1\u4f8b\u6240\u9700\u6cbb\u7597\u4f8b\u6570(NNT)\u4e3a7.5\uff1b\u6cbb\u7597\u7ec4\u7684\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u4e3a13.3%(10/75)\uff0c\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u4e3a41.1%(31/75),\u4e24\u7ec4\u6bd4\u8f83P<0.001\uff0cARR\u4e3a27.8%\uff0cNNT\u4e3a3.6\u3002 \u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a \u5c3d\u7ba1SeIVH\u7684\u9884\u540e\u5dee\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0e\u4fdd\u5b88\u6cbb\u7597\u76f8\u6bd4\u8f83EVD\u6cbb\u7597\u660e\u663e\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u8fd9\u7c7b\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u51fa\u9662\u7ed3\u5c40\u3002\u5f00\u5c55\u9a8c\u8bc1EVD\u7597\u6548\u7684\u968f\u673a\u5bf9\u7167\u7814\u7a76\u662f\u9700\u8981\u7684\u3002.", "doi": null, "title": "[Retrospective analysis of the discharge outcome of external ventricular drainage and conservative treatment in patients with severe intraventricular hemorrhage].", "journal": ["Zhonghua yi xue za zhi", "Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi"]}
