It provides a more anterior projection when compared to the pterional approach. There are some minor differences of the modified lateral supraorbital approach when compared to lateral supraorbital approach. It is directed more subfrontally and anterior than the pterional and lateral supraorbital approach.We used modified lateral supraorbital approach in 100 cases between 2012 and 2015 in Medical Park \u0130zmir Hospital/Turkey. The assessed data were as follows: age, gender, Glasgow coma scale at admission, the localization of pathology, the condition of surgical obliteration for aneurysm, excision grade for meningioma, length of stay in the hospital and Glasgow outcoma scale at discharge.Of all patients, 58 (58%) were men and 42 (42%) were women. Our cases were anterior communicating artery aneurysms (41 cases), tuberculum sella and medial sphenoid wing meningiomas (22 cases), middle cerebral artery aneurysms (15 cases), olfactory groove meningiomas (15 cases), anterior choroidal artery aneurysms (4 cases) and posterior communicating artery aneurysms (3 cases). 4 patients died and the mortality rate of the study cohort was 4%.The MLSA is faster, simpler and less invasive than the PA and LSA.", "doi": "10.1080/02688697.2017.1409877", "title": "The modified lateral supraorbital approach.", "journal": ["British journal of neurosurgery", "Br J Neurosurg"]}
