A total of 117 (0.74%) children were confirmed to have IMD, including 77 cases of methylmalonic acidemia (65.8%). The clinical manifestations of confirmed cases in the neonatal period mainly included jaundice, metabolic acidosis, abnormal muscular tension, feeding difficulty, poor response, and lethargy or coma. The clinical manifestations of confirmed cases in the non-neonatal period mainly included delayed mental and motor development, metabolic acidosis, convulsion, recurrent vomiting, and anemia.GC-MS is an effective method for the screening for IMD in children at risk. Methylmalonic acidemia is the most common IMD. The clinical manifestations of IMD are different between the confirmed cases in the neonatal and non-neonatal periods.", "doi": null, "title": "[Clinical analysis of 15\u2009851 children at risk of inherited metabolic diseases].", "journal": ["Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics", "Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi"]}
