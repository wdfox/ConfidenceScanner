Transporter proteins participate in TBI recovery by maintaining the central nervous system (CNS) biochemical milieu. Genetic variations in transporters that alter expression and/or function have been associated with TBI outcomes. The ATP-binding cassette transporter, ABCG2, is a uric acid (UA) transporter that effluxes UA from cells in the CNS and is responsible for systemic UA clearance. Uric acid is a CNS antioxidant and/or a biomarker that might support TBI recovery. Our objective was to investigate the impact of ABCG2 SNP: c.421C>A on TBI outcomes. Two cohorts (discovery [N\u2009=\u2009270] and replication [N\u2009=\u2009166]) were genotyped for ABCG2 c.421C>A. Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) scores were collected at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months post-injury and compared with mixed-effects multiple ordinal regression controlled for time post-injury, age, sex, time, post-injury imaging determined hemorrhage types, and Glasgow Coma Scale score. Variant alleles (genotype) were associated with better GOS scores (p\u2009=\u20090.01 [discovery] and p\u2009=\u20090.02 [replication]), whereas genotype*age interaction was associated with worse GOS scores (p\u2009=\u20090.03 [discovery] and p\u2009=\u20090.01 [replication]). Reversed coefficient directionality suggests variant allele(s) are protective up to approximately age 34 years. Overall, variant alleles at ABCG2 c.421C>A associate with better GOS scores post-injury in two independently sampled cohorts. This finding is mitigated by increasing subject age. This suggests that ABCG2 might have an age-dependent effect on TBI recovery and should be explored in future mechanistic studies.", "doi": "10.1089/neu.2017.5000", "title": "ABCG2 c.421C>A Is Associated with Outcomes after Severe Traumatic Brain Injury.", "journal": ["Journal of neurotrauma", "J.
