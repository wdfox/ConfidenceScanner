Nine patients had BD on admission with a sustainable BIS value of 0. Fifty-three patients were not initially diagnosed with BD with BIS values of 2-56. Forty-four patients deteriorated to BD, and their respective BIS values progressively decreased to 0. Nine patients with mean BIS of 39.2 \u00b1 9.0 recovered and were transferred to a specialized high dependency unit. BIS values showed positive correlation with the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) on admission (r = 0.43, p = 0.001). Survivors had higher BIS values than those who were initially declared BD or those who died during the hospitalization course (p = 0.001).BIS values have a significant correlation with initial GCS and can assist in the early detection of BD in patients with severe acute TBI. Further larger studies are needed to support our findings.", "doi": "10.1080/02699052.2017.1330966", "title": "Bispectral index as a predictor of unsalvageable traumatic brain injury.", "journal": ["Brain injury", "Brain Inj"]}
