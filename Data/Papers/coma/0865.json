This study aimed to explore the efficacy of minimally invasive surgery for patients with HICH with large hematoma volume.A total of 104 patients with HICH with a hematoma volume >50 mL were treated with different surgical approaches. The patients were allotted to a minimally invasive surgery group (minimally invasive, n\u00a0=\u00a070) and conventional craniotomy group (craniotomy group, n\u00a0= 34). Patients were followed-up for 30 days postoperatively, and their clinical data were compared.No statistically significant differences were found in age, sex, hematoma volume, and preoperative Glasgow Coma Scale score between the 2 groups (P > 0.05), whereas patient age was slightly greater in the minimally invasive group than the craniotomy group (P < 0.05). Postoperative mortality and complication rates in the minimally invasive group were significantly lower than those in the\u00a0craniotomy group (20% vs. 44.1% and 15.2% vs. 29.4%, P\u00a0< 0.05), and a better Glasgow Outcome Scale score at 30 days postoperatively was found in the minimally invasive group than the craniotomy group (P < 0.05). No significant differences were observed between the 2 groups in terms of mortality rate in patients with brain herniation and complication rates of postoperative renal failure, pulmonary infection, and cerebral infarction (P > 0.05).Minimally invasive surgery is safe and effective in patients with HICH with a hematoma volume >50 mL. Because of its minimal invasiveness, better recovery rate, lower mortality rate, and less complications, this approach is considered superior to craniotomy. However, further validation on a larger sample size is required.", "doi": "10.1016/j.wneu.2017.05.158", "title": "Minimally Invasive Surgery for Patients with Hypertensive Intracerebral Hemorrhage with Large Hematoma Volume: A Retrospective Study.", "journal": ["World neurosurgery", "World Neurosurg"]}
