The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of body mass index (BMI) on mortality and early neurologic outcome in patients suffering from severe TBI with a special focus on obesity classes II and III (BMI \u226535).A retrospective cohort analysis of patients suffering from a leading, at least severe TBI and registered in the TraumaRegister DGU was conducted. Patients alive on admission with full status documentation on Glasgow Coma Scale, height, and weight were classified into 4 BMI subgroups. Early neurologic outcome was classified using the Glasgow Outcome Scale.A total of 1634 patients met the inclusion criteria. Lowest mortality was documented for BMI group 1 (15.2%, BMI 25.0-29.9918.5). Highest mortality was found in BMI group 5 (25.6%, BMI \u226535). BMI \u226535 was an independent predictor of mortality with an odds ratio of 3.15 (95% confidence interval [1.06-9.36], P\u00a0= 0.039). Further independent mortality predictors were >65 years of age, a Glasgow Coma Scale of \u226413, an Abbreviated Injury Scalehead \u22655, prehospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and a prehospital blood pressure of <90 mm Hg. In terms of good early neurologic outcomes, no differences were recorded between the BMI groups (range 59.0%-62.6%, P\u00a0= 0.087).In this study a BMI \u226535 is an independent predictor of mortality and is associated with an inferior early functional neurologic outcome.", "doi": "10.1016/j.wneu.2017.08.010", "title": "Body Mass Index >35 as Independent Predictor of Mortality in Severe Traumatic Brain Injury.", "journal": ["World neurosurgery", "World Neurosurg"]}
