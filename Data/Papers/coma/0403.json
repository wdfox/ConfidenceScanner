Estimating neurologic prognosis for patients that remain comatose after resuscitation remains a challenge and the need for accurate and early prognostic predictors is crucial. A thoughtful approach is required and should take into account information acquired from multiple tests in association with neurologic examination. No decision should be made based on a single predictor. In addition to clinical examination, somatosensory evoked potentials, electroencephalogram, serum biomarkers, and neuroimaging provide complimentary information to inform prognosis.", "doi": "10.1016/j.ncl.2017.06.001", "title": "Anoxic-Ischemic Brain Injury.", "journal": ["Neurologic clinics", "Neurol Clin"]}
