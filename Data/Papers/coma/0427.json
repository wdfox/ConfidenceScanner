Meanwhile, ocular HOAs were measured for a 6.0 mm pupil with a Hartmann-Shack wavefront analyzer.In the study, the subjects with an average spherical equivalent of -4.86\u00b12.07 D were included. HOAs decreased from the third to the sixth order aberrations with predominant aberrations of third-order coma, trefoil and fourth-order spherical aberration. At low and moderate spatial frequencies, CS was negatively correlated with the third-order coma and trefoil aberrations, and decreased with increasing Z31, but increased with increasing Z3-3 and Z5-1. At high spatial frequencies, CS decreased with increasing Z3-3 and increased with increasing Z5-1.At a large pupil size of 6.0 mm, the third-order aberrations, but not the total aberrations, are the main factors affecting CS. Vertical coma is negatively correlated with CS.", "doi": "10.18240/ijo.2017.09.13", "title": "Effects of higher-order aberrations on contrast sensitivity in normal eyes of a large myopic population.", "journal": ["International journal of ophthalmology", "Int J Ophthalmol"]}
