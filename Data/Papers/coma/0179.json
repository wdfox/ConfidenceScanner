Predictors included age at injury, pre-injury education, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), pre-injury incarceration and psychiatric history.Craig Handicap Assessment and Reporting Technique (CHART), including Cognitive Independence, Physical Independence, Mobility, Occupation and Social Integration domains.Models were significant for Cognitive and Physical Independence, Mobility, and Occupation. Incarceration and psychiatric history accounted for the most variance in Cognitive and Physical Independence, over and above GCS and age at injury. Psychiatric history was also the strongest predictor of Occupation. Mobility was the only domain in which GCS accounted for the most variance.Pre-injury psychosocial and demographic factors may be more important than injury severity for predicting some long-term functional outcomes post-TBI. It would likely be beneficial to assess these factors in the inpatient setting, with input from a multidisciplinary team, as an early understanding of prognostic indicators can help guide treatment for optimal functional outcomes.", "doi": "10.1080/02699052.2017.1374467", "title": "Pre-injury psychosocial and demographic predictors of long-term functional outcomes post-TBI.", "journal": ["Brain injury", "Brain Inj"]}
