This paper proposes a water-cooled unimorph DM which can withstand the laser power up to 10 kW in thermal simulation. The proposed DM consists of an annular PZT layer and a circular Si layer which are glued together with edge clamped. All the 32 piezoelectric actuators are distributed around the correction area and on the front side of the DM. The cooling water flows through the back side of the DM and cools the mirror directly. This design realizes the physical separation of the actuators and the coolant. The experimental results of a fabricated DM prototype show that the DM can reproduce typical low-order aberrations accurately with relatively large amplitude. The wavefront PV amplitudes of the reproduced tip/tilt, astigmatism, defocus, trefoil and coma shapes for 15 mm aperture are about 40 \u03bcm, 24 \u03bcm, 18.7 \u03bcm, 10 \u03bcm and 6 \u03bcm, respectively.", "doi": null, "title": "Development of a unimorph deformable mirror with water cooling.", "journal": ["Optics express", "Opt Express"]}
