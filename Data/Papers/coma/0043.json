Activity of Daily Living Scale \uff08ADL\uff09, Functional Activities Questionnaire \uff08FAQ\uff09 and Social Disability Screening Schedule \uff08SDSS\uff09 were used to evaluate the severity of patients. All the participants were tested by Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale \uff08WAIS\uff09 and examined by EEG.Totally 215 patients accomplished the study. The results of Glasgow Coma Scale \uff08GCS\uff09, the severity of craniocerebral injury and the scores of FAQ, SDSS and ADL showed significant difference among the patients with different severity of EEG \uff08P<0.05\uff09. The grades of psychiatric impairment showed significant difference among the patients with different abnormal EEG \uff08P<0.05\uff09.EEG can reflect the severity of craniocerebral injury, assist evaluate the social function and activity of daily living of patients with mental disorders due to traumatic brain injury, and distinguish the mild psychiatric impairment grades, which suggest that EEG has a certain reference value in the assessment of psychiatric impairment.", "doi": "10.3969/j.issn.1004-5619.2017.05.011", "title": "[Applied Value of Electroencephalogram in Assessment of Mild Psychiatry Impairment].", "journal": ["Fa yi xue za zhi", "Fa Yi Xue Za Zhi"]}
