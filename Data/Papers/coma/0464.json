When encountering a comatose patient, the clinician must have an organized approach to detect easily remediable causes, prevent ongoing neurologic injury, and determine a hierarchical plan for diagnostic tests, treatments, and neuromonitoring. Coma was chosen as an Emergency Neurological Life Support protocol because timely medical and surgical interventions can be life-saving, and the initial work-up of such patients is critical to establishing a correct diagnosis.", "doi": "10.1007/s12028-017-0452-1", "title": "Emergency Neurological Life Support: Approach to the Patient with Coma.", "journal": ["Neurocritical care", "Neurocrit Care"]}
