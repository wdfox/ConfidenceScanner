Eligible patients were adults admitted to the ICU with a Glasgow Coma Score <8 due to hypoglycemia and persistent consciousness disorders after normalizing blood glucose levels. Patients with possible other causes of consciousness disorders, previous cognitive disorders, hypothermia <35\u00a0\u00b0C or circulatory arrest within 24\u00a0h after ICU admission, were excluded. Follow-up phone call was used to determine patients' functional outcome using modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at a minimum of 1-year follow-up with mRS 0-3 defining good and mRS 4-6 poor outcomes.Forty-nine patients were included. Causes of hypoglycemia were various, mainly including insulin or oral antidiabetic drugs abuse (65%) and neuroendocrine carcinoma (16%). Twenty (41%) patients died in the ICU, two (4%) patients further died and nine (18%) patients had a poor outcome at long-term follow-up. Five patients discharged from the ICU with mRS\u00a0>\u00a03 improved enough to be in the good outcome group 1\u00a0year later. Twenty-two (45%) patients underwent therapeutic limitation, mainly related to no expected hope for improvement. On multivariate analysis, only low mRS prior to ICU admission (OR 2.6; 95% CI 1.1-6.3; P\u00a0=\u00a00.03) and normal brain imaging (OR 7.1; 95% CI 1.1-44; P\u00a0=\u00a00.03) were significantly predictive of a good outcome. All patients (n\u00a0=\u00a015) who remained hypoglycemic >480\u00a0min had a poor outcome.Poor outcome was observed in about 60% of this population of hypoglycemic encephalopathy. However, some patients can recover satisfactorily over time.", "doi": "10.1186/s13613-017-0277-2", "title": "Functional outcome of patients with prolonged hypoglycemic encephalopathy.", "journal": ["Annals of intensive care", "Ann Intensive Care"]}
