Absence of pupillary reflexes remains a reliable predictor of poor outcome. Diffusion-weighted imaging has emerged as a potential predictor of recovery, and here we compare imaging characteristics to pupillary exam.We identified 69 patients who had MRIs within seven days of arrest and used a semi-automated algorithm to perform quantitative volumetric analysis of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) sequences at various thresholds. Area under receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC-AUC) were estimated to compare predictive values of quantitative MRI with pupillary exam at days 3, 5 and 7 post-arrest, for persistence of coma and functional outcomes at discharge. Cerebral Performance Category scores of 3-4 were considered poor outcome.Excluding patients where life support was withdrawn, \u22652.8% diffusion restriction of the entire brain at an ADC of \u2264650\u00d710-6m2/s was 100% specific and 68% sensitive for failure to wake up from coma before discharge. The ROC-AUC of ADC changes at \u2264450\u00d710-6mm2/s and \u2264650\u00d710-6mm2/s were significantly superior in predicting failure to wake up from coma compared to bilateral absence of pupillary reflexes. Among survivors, >0.01% of diffusion restriction of the entire brain at an ADC \u2264450\u00d710-6m2/s was 100% specific and 46% sensitive for poor functional outcome at discharge. The ROC curve predicting poor functional outcome at ADC \u2264450\u00d710-6mm2/s had an AUC of 0.737 (0.574-0.899, p=0.04).Post-anoxic diffusion changes using quantitative brain MRI may aid in predicting persistent coma and poor functional outcomes at hospital discharge.", "doi": "10.1016/j.resuscitation.2017.06.010", "title": "Post-anoxic quantitative MRI changes may predict emergence from coma and functional outcomes at discharge.", "journal": ["Resuscitation", "Resuscitation"]}
