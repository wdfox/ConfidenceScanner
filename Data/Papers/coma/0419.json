Its association with memory after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is unclear.mTBI patients (Glasgow Coma Scale score 13-15, no neurosurgical intervention, extracranial Abbreviated Injury Scale score \u22641) aged \u226518 years with APOE genotyping results were extracted from the Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury Pilot (TRACK-TBI Pilot) study. Cohorts determined by APOE-\u03b54(+/-) were assessed for associations with 6-month verbal memory, measured by California Verbal Learning Test, Second Edition (CVLT-II) subscales: Immediate Recall Trials 1-5 (IRT), Short-Delay Free Recall (SDFR), Short-Delay Cued Recall (SDCR), Long-Delay Free Recall (LDFR), and Long-Delay Cued Recall (LDCR). Multivariable regression controlled for demographic factors, seizure history, loss of consciousness, posttraumatic amnesia, and acute intracranial pathology on computed tomography (CT).In 114 mTBI patients (APOE-\u03b54(-)=79; APOE-\u03b54(+)=35), ApoE-\u03b54(+) was associated with long-delay verbal memory deficits (LDFR: B\u00a0=\u00a0-1.17 points, 95% CI [-2.33, -0.01], p\u00a0=\u00a0.049; LDCR: B\u00a0=\u00a0-1.58 [-2.63, -0.52], p\u00a0=\u00a0.004), and a marginal decrease on SDCR (B\u00a0=\u00a0-1.02 [-2.05, 0.00], p\u00a0=\u00a0.050). CT pathology was the strongest predictor of decreased verbal memory (IRT: B\u00a0=\u00a0-8.49, SDFR: B\u00a0=\u00a0-2.50, SDCR: B\u00a0=\u00a0-1.85, LDFR: B\u00a0=\u00a0-2.61, LDCR: B\u00a0=\u00a0-2.60; p\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Seizure history was associated with decreased short-term memory (SDFR: B\u00a0=\u00a0-1.32, p\u00a0=\u00a0.037; SDCR: B\u00a0=\u00a0-1.44, p\u00a0=\u00a0.038).The APOE-\u03b54 allele may confer an increased risk of impairment of 6-month verbal memory for patients suffering mTBI, with implications for heightened surveillance and targeted therapies.
