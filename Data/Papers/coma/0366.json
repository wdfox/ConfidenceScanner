Multivariate analysis was performed to correlate patient outcome with various factors, including pre-injury APA intake. Cause of death was compared among groups stratified according to APA dose.Increasing doses of APAs were positively associated with mortality rates, however, differences were primarily due to non-traumatic causes. APA therapy before injury was independent of both overall and non-traumatic mortality. In multivariate analysis, mortality was significantly correlated with the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), pupillary abnormalities, age, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), head Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) and additional AIS >2. Conversely, non-traumatic mortality was associated with age, GCS, additional AIS >2 and CCI, though only CCI was correlated with increasing APA dose. Furthermore, no significant difference was observed when comparing mortalities according to CCI score among APA groups. Thus, mortalities were associated with the severity of pre-existing conditions rather than APA dose.The outcome of patients with TBI, who were on APAs may be determined by the severity of pre-existing conditions. Aggressive TBI treatment should be implemented when tolerable, regardless of pre-existing APA treatment status.", "doi": "10.1080/02699052.2017.1377349", "title": "Outcome of traumatic brain injury in patients on antiplatelet agents: a retrospective 20-year observational study in a single neurosurgery unit.", "journal": ["Brain injury", "Brain Inj"]}
