We describe a case of mixed overdose, including propranolol, amlodipine and olanzapine, resulting in severe resistant hypotension which was successfully treated. A 21-year-old student ingested 6.4\u2009g of propranolol, 280\u2009mg of amlodipine and 560\u2009mg of olanzapine. The patient was brought to the emergency department and exhibited signs of severe systemic toxicity - profound hypotension and circulatory collapse, respiratory depression and coma. The patient had conventional therapy but failed to respond to this and was therefore commenced on IntraLipid infusion, high-dose insulin infusion and inotrope infusion. An endoscopy was performed in intensive care which revealed a large drug beozar - this was removed. We believe that this combination of infusions with early endoscopy could be beneficial in treating similar patients in the future and present the first case of a propranolol drug bezoar.", "doi": "10.1177/1751143717693860", "title": "Too many pills to swallow: A case of a mixed overdose.", "journal": ["Journal of the Intensive Care Society", "J Intensive Care Soc"]}
