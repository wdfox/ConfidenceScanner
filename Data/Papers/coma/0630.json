She had been reviewed in a walk-in clinic 72 hours earlier and had been prescribed the standard 1000\u2009mg three times per day of valacyclovir for an acute attack of shingles instead of 500\u2009mg once a day on ESRD. In the ER, she received further 500\u2009mg of intravenous acyclovir as herpes encephalitis was clinically suspected. CT of the brain and lumbar puncture were non-contributory to the diagnosis. Valacyclovir and acyclovir were discontinued when the diagnosis of valacyclovir-associated neurotoxicity became clinically evident. As the patient's Glasgow Coma Scale declined, we intensified her PD regimen from one to six exchanges per day and 24\u2009hours later there was a significant neurological improvement.", "doi": "10.1136/bcr-2017-220678", "title": "Valacyclovir-associated neurotoxicity treated with intensification of peritoneal dialysis.", "journal": ["BMJ case reports", "BMJ Case Rep"]}
