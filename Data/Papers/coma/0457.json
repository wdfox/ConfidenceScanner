The 2-year follow-up examination included uncorrected (UDVA) and corrected (CDVA) distance visual acuities, Scheimpflug tomography, in\u00a0vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM), and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT).The study comprised 132 eyes of 96 patients (mean age 23.7\u00a0years\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.3 [SD]) with stage II keratoconus. The change in UDVA and CDVA was statistically significant, from 0.51\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.106 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) at baseline to 0.309\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.074 logMAR (P\u00a0=\u00a0.0001) and 0.271\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.144 logMAR\u00a0at baseline to 0.135\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.100 logMAR (P\u00a0=\u00a0.0023), respectively. Coma values measured by Scheimpflug analysis showed a statistically significant improvement beginning with the first postoperative month (P\u00a0=\u00a0.0004). The IVCM scans documented basal epithelial healing occurring 72\u00a0hours after treatment associated with the presence of subepithelial nerves. The SD-OCT scans performed in the central 6.0\u00a0mm of corneal diameter documented a demarcation line at a mean depth of 280\u00a0\u00b1\u00a032\u00a0\u03bcm.The 15\u00a0mW/cm2 pulsed-light epithelium-off accelerated CXL was effective and safe, stabilizing keratoconus progression through 2\u00a0years of follow-up.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jcrs.2017.05.030", "title": "Accelerated 15\u00a0mW pulsed-light crosslinking to treat progressive keratoconus: Two-year clinical results.", "journal": ["Journal of cataract and refractive surgery", "J Cataract Refract Surg"]}
