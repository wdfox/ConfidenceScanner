Methods: A total of 173 patients with sTBI, who treated in Emergency Neurosurgery Department of Shandong University Qilu Hospital from January, 2011 to September, 2015 were collected and divided into research group and control group, according to their therapeutic strategy.The clinical data during hospitalization and prognosis 1 year after injury was analyzed retrospectively to clarify the effect of acute encephalocele prevention strategy. Results: There were no statistically significant differences in sex, age, preoperative Glasgow coma scale score and imaging type of lesion between patients from the two groups.The highest intraoperative intracranial pressure in the research group and control group were (35.71\u00b14.13) mmHg and(34.85\u00b13.81) mmHg, respectively.The acute encephalocele incidence of the research group (7 cases, 6.5%) was significantly lower than that of the control group (13 cases, 19.7%) (P<0.01). Subgroup analysis showed that the incidence of acute encephalocele in patients with only unilateral lesions was low (1.3%), while higher (19.4%) in patients with both unilateral lesions and other secondary lesions or diffuse brain swelling.The prognosis of the patients was evaluated by Glasgow Outcome Scale according to the follow-up 1 year after injury, and it was suggested that the percentage of patients with good outcome in the research group (62 cases, 57.9%) was remarkably higher than that in the control group (26 cases, 39.4%) (P=0.018). Conclusions: For sTBI patients with high risk of acute encephalocele, prevention strategy was found to be able to retard the progression of delayed hematoma and diffuse brain swelling, prevent the acute encephalocele during operation, and then significantly improve the prognosis.\u76ee\u7684\uff1a \u63a2\u8ba8\u6025\u6027\u8111\u81a8\u51fa\u9884\u9632\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u9884\u9632\u91cd\u578b\u9885\u8111\u5916\u4f24(sTBI)\u672f\u4e2d\u6025\u6027\u8111\u81a8\u51fa\u53ca\u6539\u5584\u9884\u540e\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002 \u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a \u6536\u96c62011\u5e741\u6708\u81f32015\u5e749\u6708\u5c71\u4e1c\u5927\u5b66\u9f50\u9c81\u533b\u9662\u6025\u8bca\u795e\u7ecf\u5916\u79d1\u6536\u6cbb\u7684\u5e55\u4e0asTBI\u60a3\u8005173\u4f8b\uff0c2012\u5e7412\u6708\u524d\u7684\u60a3\u8005\u5747\u672a\u91c7\u7528\u6025\u6027\u8111\u81a8\u51fa\u9884\u9632\u7b56\u7565\u6cbb\u7597\uff0c\u7eb3\u5165\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4(66\u4f8b)\uff0c2013\u5e741\u6708\u540e\u7684\u60a3\u8005\u5747\u91c7\u7528\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u6cbb\u7597\uff0c\u7eb3\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u7ec4(107\u4f8b)\u3002\u5bf9\u5176\u4f4f\u9662\u8d44\u6599\u548c\u4f24\u540e1\u5e74\u683c\u62c9\u65af\u54e5\u9884\u540e(GOS)\u8bc4\u5206\u7b49\u8fdb\u884c\u56de\u987e\u6027\u961f\u5217\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u6025\u6027\u8111\u81a8\u51fa\u9884\u9632\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u6548\u679c\u3002 \u7ed3\u679c\uff1a \u4e24\u7ec4\u6027\u522b\u3001\u5e74\u9f84\u3001\u672f\u524d\u683c\u62c9\u65af\u54e5\u660f\u8ff7(GCS)\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u5f71\u50cf\u5b66\u75c5\u53d8\u7c7b\u578b\u5dee\u5f02\u5747\u65e0\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ec4\u4e0e\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u672f\u524d\u9885\u5185\u538b\u6700\u9ad8\u503c\u5206\u522b\u4e3a(35.71\u00b14.13) mmHg\u548c(34.85\u00b13.81) mmHg\uff1b\u672f\u4e2d\u6025\u6027\u8111\u81a8\u51fa\u53d1\u751f\u7387\u7814\u7a76\u7ec4(7\u4f8b\uff0c6.5%)\u660e\u663e\u4f4e\u4e8e\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4(13\u4f8b\uff0c19.7%)(P<0.01)\uff1b\u4e9a\u7ec4\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5355\u7eaf\u5355\u4fa7\u75c5\u53d8\u8005\u6025\u6027\u8111\u81a8\u51fa\u53d1\u751f\u7387\u4f4e(1.3%)\uff0c\u800c\u5355\u4fa7\u75c5\u53d8\u4e3a\u4e3b\u5408\u5e76\u5176\u4f59\u90e8\u4f4d\u75c5\u53d8\u6216\u5f25\u6f2b\u6027\u8111\u80bf\u80c0\u8005\u6025\u6027\u8111\u81a8\u51fa\u53d1\u751f\u7387\u9ad8(19.4%)\u3002\u4f24\u540e1\u5e74\u5bf9\u60a3\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u968f\u8bbf\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u7814\u7a76\u7ec4\u9884\u540e\u826f\u597d62\u4f8b(57.9%)\uff0c\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec426\u4f8b(39.4%)\uff0c\u5dee\u5f02\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49(P\uff1d0.018)\u3002 \u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a \u5bf9\u5355\u4fa7\u75c5\u53d8\u4e3a\u4e3b\u5408\u5e76\u5176\u4f59\u90e8\u4f4d\u75c5\u53d8\u6216\u5f25\u6f2b\u6027\u8111\u80bf\u80c0\u7684\u60a3\u8005\uff0c\u672f\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u6025\u6027\u8111\u81a8\u51fa\u9884\u9632\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5ef6\u7f13\u8fdf\u53d1\u6027\u8840\u80bf\u6216\u5f25\u6f2b\u6027\u8111\u80bf\u80c0\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6025\u6027\u8111\u81a8\u51fa\u7684\u53d1\u751f\u7387\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6539\u5584\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u9884\u540e\u3002.", "doi": null, "title": "[Clinical efficacy of acute intraoperative encephalocele prevention strategy for severe traumatic brain injury].", "journal": ["Zhonghua yi xue za zhi", "Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi"]}
