She had signs of traumatic head injury with Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3, and her neurological examination was consistent with brain death. She was persistently hypoxic on conventional mechanical ventilation and high-frequency percussive ventilation was initiated. The patient's oxygenation improved and was sustained long enough to provide time for organ procurement. This is the first case portraying high-frequency percussive ventilation as a bridge for donors failing on conventional mechanical ventilation.", "doi": "10.1177/0885066617709969", "title": "Use of High-Frequency Percussive Ventilation to Expand Organ Donor Pool.", "journal": ["Journal of intensive care medicine", "J Intensive Care Med"]}
