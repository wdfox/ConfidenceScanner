The new isolate assimilated inulin more efficiently than other carbohydrates from Jerusalem artichoke, without hydrolytic treatment. To investigate the effect of inulin on \u03b3-PGA production, the transcript levels of \u03b3-PGA synthetase genes (pgsB, pgsC, pgsA), regulatory genes (comA, degQ, degS), and the glutamic acid biosynthesis gene (glnA) were analyzed; inulin addition upregulated these key genes. Without exogenous glutamate, strain NX-2S could produce 6.85\u00b10.22g/L of \u03b3-PGA during fermentation. Exogenous glutamate greatly enhances the \u03b3-PGA yield (39.4\u00b10.38g/L) and productivity (0.43\u00b10.05g/L/h) in batch fermentation. Our study revealed a potential method of non-food fermentation to produce high-value products.", "doi": "10.1016/j.biortech.2017.05.005", "title": "Development of Jerusalem artichoke resource for efficient one-step fermentation of poly-(\u03b3-glutamic acid) using a novel strain Bacillus amyloliquefaciens NX-2S.", "journal": ["Bioresource technology", "Bioresour.
