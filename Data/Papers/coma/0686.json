As to we know, the possible association between circulating levels of melatonin levels and mortality of patients with TBI have not been explored; thus, the objective of our current study was to determine whether this association actually exists.This multicenter study included 118 severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale <9) patients. We measured serum levels of melatonin, malondialdehyde (to assess lipid peroxidation) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) at day 1 of severe TBI. We used mortality at 30\u00a0days as endpoint.We found that non-survivor (n\u00a0=\u00a033) compared to survivor (n\u00a0=\u00a085) TBI patients showed higher circulating levels of melatonin (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), TAC (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and MDA (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). We found that serum melatonin levels predicted 30-day mortality (Odds ratio\u00a0=\u00a01.334; 95% confidence interval\u00a0=\u00a01.094-1.627; p\u00a0=\u00a00.004), after to control for GCS, CT findings and age. We found a correlation between serum levels of melatonin levels and serum levels of TAC (rho\u00a0=\u00a00.37; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and serum levels of MDA (rho\u00a0=\u00a00.24; p\u00a0=\u00a00.008).As to we know, our study is the largest series providing circulating melatonin levels in patients with severe TBI. The main findings were that non-survivors had higher serum melatonin levels than survivors, and the association between serum levels of melatonin levels and mortality, peroxidation state and antioxidant state.", "doi": "10.1186/s12883-017-0922-2", "title": "Serum melatonin levels in survivor and non-survivor patients with traumatic brain injury.", "journal": ["BMC neurology", "BMC Neurol"]}
