These patients were divided into two groups based on imaging results: a normal DWI group and an abnormal DWI group. Data regarding clinical courses and long-term neurologic outcomes (persistent severe neurologic sequelae) were collected and compared.The rate of abnormal DWI findings at presentation was 23.4%, and the most common site of abnormalities was the globus pallidus. All lesions in abnormal DWI had decreased apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values. The long-term neurologic state was assessed at a median follow-up of 19.5 months, and the frequency of poor long-term neurologic outcome was significantly higher in the abnormal DWI group (40.0% in the abnormal DWI group vs. 1.0% in the normal DWI group; p\u2009<\u2009.001). Abnormal DWI (odds ratio [OR]): 31.3, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.5-397) and old age (OR 1.1, 95% CI: 1.001-1.13) were independent factors for poor long-term neurologic outcomes, whereas the Glasgow Coma Scale score at presentation (OR: 0.7, 95% CI: 0.6-0.9) was negatively associated with the risk of poor long-term neurologic outcome.In cases involving CO poisoning due to charcoal burning, DWI at presentation may help predict the long-term neurological outcome after discharge.", "doi": "10.1080/15563650.2017.1352098", "title": "Initial diffusion-weighted MRI and long-term neurologic outcomes in charcoal-burning carbon monoxide poisoning.", "journal": ["Clinical toxicology (Philadelphia, Pa.)", "Clin Toxicol (Phila)"]}
