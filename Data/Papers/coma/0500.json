GuillainBarre syndrome (GBS) induced by heat stroke is extremely rare, and its manifestation with damage to multiple cranial nerves has not been described.We describe a rare case of GBS induced by heat stroke with damage to multiple cranial and peripheral nerves. The clinical, radiological, and electrophysiological profiles were presented and analyzed.A 41-year-old man presented with aggressive speech difficulty, dysphagia, right blepharoptosis, and quadriplegia following coma. A diagnosis of glossopharyngeal, vagus, oculomotor, and peripheral nerve damage was made. After immunoglobulin administration, the patient's neurological deficiencies were relieved significantly. During a follow-up period of 3 months, the patient experienced complete remission.To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of GBS induced by heat stroke presenting with damage to multiple cranial and peripheral nerves. The early diagnosis and timely immunological treatment of GBS should be emphasized, as they facilitate a favorable prognosis.", "doi": null, "title": "Guillain-Barre Syndrome Induced by Heat Stroke: a Case Report and Literature Review.", "journal": ["Clinical laboratory", "Clin.
