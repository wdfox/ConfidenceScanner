Imaging and intraparenchymal intracranial pressure monitoring confirmed secondary IH. She was managed with an epidural blood patch and a 72-hour period in the Trendelenburg position guided by intracranial pressure monitoring and clinical assessment. She subsequently made an excellent neurologic recovery from an initial Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3 to a score of\u00a015.Secondary IH can easily be missed in patients who have sustained a primary brain injury. In patients with a poor neurologic recovery, clinicians should rule out secondary IH as a potential cause, as immediate treatment can lead to profound clinical improvement.", "doi": "10.1016/j.wneu.2017.06.060", "title": "Intracranial Hypotension Following Traumatic Brain Injury: A Diagnostic and Therapeutic Challenge.", "journal": ["World neurosurgery", "World Neurosurg"]}
