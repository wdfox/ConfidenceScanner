Overdose of quetiapine can result in severe complications, such as coma, seizure, respiratory depression, arrhythmia, and even death. However, the paucity of toxicological evaluation in adolescence causes more potential risks in this population. Herein, we present a case of hypotension and convulsive syncope after exposure to a small dose of quetiapine in a 16-year-old who was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. After cessation of quetiapine, no additional convulsive movements were reported. This case indicates that even in young patients without predisposing factors, close monitoring of adverse effects should be warranted for safety concerns, especially at the initiation of quetiapine treatment.", "doi": "10.2147/NDT.S137923", "title": "Convulsive syncope related to a small dose of quetiapine in an adolescent with bipolar disorder.", "journal": ["Neuropsychiatric disease and treatment", "Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat"]}
