For their analysis, we propose a simplified ray-tracing model of an AO crystal cell (AOC). With this approach, one can assign any configuration of AO interaction, any material and geometry of the crystal, and then estimate all conventional ray aberrations, such as spherical, coma, astigmatism, distortion, etc. The optimization procedure is demonstrated by the aberration analysis of three principal spectral imaging schemes based on AO tunable filters (AOTFs). The approach developed promises performance improvement of AOTF-based systems for high-quality spectral imaging and image processing.", "doi": null, "title": "Aberration analysis of AOTF-based spectral imaging systems.", "journal": ["Journal of the Optical Society of America.
