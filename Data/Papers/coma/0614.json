However, the mean COHb t1/2 of 12 male volunteer smokers was 26.3 minutes at 1.58 ATA and in 12 non-intubated carbon monoxide (CO) poisoned patients treated at 3 ATA, was 43 minutes.An 81-year old male, poisoned by an improperly ventilated natural gas heater, was intubated for coma, then treated with HBO\u2082. His PaO\u2082/FiO\u2082 = 283 from aspiration. His initial COHb was 34.4%, and 18 minutes before HBO\u2082, 5.9%. After a compression interval of 17 minutes, the COHb measured after 22 minutes at 3 ATA was 3.3%.By exponential decay, his COHb t1/2 before HBO\u2082 was 95 minutes. We estimate the range for COHb t1/2 during compression as 62-81 minutes and for the 3-ATA interval, 58 to 49 minutes, respectively. The mid-point estimate of COHb t1/2 at 3 ATA was 53 minutes.The COHb t1/2 we calculated is greater than previously reported, but longer in our patient possibly because of concomitant respiratory failure, lung dysfunction, and mechanical ventilation. The often-cited COHb t1/2 of 23 minutes, likely underestimates the actual COHb t1/2 in CO-poisoned patients, especially those with cardiopulmonary dysfunction.", "doi": null, "title": "Carboxyhemoglobin half-life during hyperbaric oxygen in a patient with lung dysfunction: a case report.", "journal": ["Undersea & hyperbaric medicine : journal of the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society, Inc", "Undersea Hyperb Med"]}
