Although spontaneous hemorrhage of these tumors is exceedingly rare, despite their vascular nature, we describe a case of recurrent hemorrhage with associated tonsillar herniation, and demonstrate that a surgical approach can provide a suitable outcome.A 54-year-old female with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome presented with acute loss of consciousness and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 4. Computed tomographic (CT) images demonstrated large volume subarachnoid hemorrhage of the posterior fossa with intraventricular extension and intraparenchymal hemorrhage involving the right cerebellar tonsil. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) displayed three lesions in the posterior fossa, two near the hemorrhage site. Patient underwent suboccipital craniectomy with a decent recovery followed by radiosurgery as she refused resection. A second hemorrhage occurred ultimately prompting surgical resection of the three posterior fossa lesions, with a reasonable postoperative course.Hemorrhage of HGBs of the posterior fossa can present in conjunction of tonsillar herniation. Re-hemorrhage appears to be likely if prior acute hemorrhage has occurred. A stepwise approach of surgical decompression and resection may provide the best outcome.", "doi": "10.4103/sni.sni_91_17", "title": "Recurrent hemorrhage in hemangioblastoma involving the posterior fossa: Case report.", "journal": ["Surgical neurology international", "Surg Neurol Int"]}
