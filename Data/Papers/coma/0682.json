However, change of tenascin-C concentrations in peripheral blood remains unknown after traumatic brain injury (TBI).Serum tenascin-C concentrations were measured in 100 healthy controls, 108 severe TBI patients, 79 moderate TBI patients and 32 mild TBI patients.Serum tenascin-C concentrations of patients were significantly higher than those of controls. Tenascin-C concentrations negatively correlated with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores in all patients (r=-0.658, P<0.001). In severe TBI patients, tenascin-C in serum significantly discriminated patients at risk of 6-month mortality (area under curve, 0.821; 95% confidence interval, 0.735-0.888) and poor outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale score of 1-3) (area under curve, 0.833; 95% confidence interval, 0.749-0.898) and emerged as an independent predictor for 6-month mortality (odds ratio, 1.114; 95% confidence interval, 1.008-1.233; P=0.005), overall survival (hazard ratio, 1.085; 95% confidence interval, 1.010-1.166; P=0.003) and unfavorable outcome (odds ratio, 1.049; 95% confidence interval, 1.014-1.076; P=0.001). By receiver-operating characteristic analysis, serum tenascin-C concentrations had similar prognostic value compared with GCS scores.Enhanced serum tenascin-C concentrations are closely related to trauma severity and clinical outcomes, substantializing tenascin-C as a potential prognostic biomarker after TBI.", "doi": "10.1016/j.cca.2017.07.018", "title": "Correlation of tenascin-C concentrations in serum with outcome of traumatic brain injury in humans.", "journal": ["Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry", "Clin.
