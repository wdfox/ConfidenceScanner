The ruptured aneurysm was successfully treated with Onyx embolization of the feeding pedicle. The AVM and the feeding artery aneurysm were then removed via a transcallosal approach. This case highlights the utility of interrogating the AVM with microcatheterization of the feeding pedicles in order to define the exact anatomical features necessary for treatment planning. It also reviews the anatomy of the choroidal fissure.
