Mechanisms of injury were gunshot wound (31%), fall (29%), and motor vehicle accident (20%). TBI occurred in 65% of SCI individuals, however documentation of identification of TBI, LOC, and CT imaging results varied in H&P, discharge notes, and ICD-9 codes across the continuum. Cognitive assessments were performed on 16% of subjects.Documentation showed variability between AC and IRF and among disciplines. Imaging and GCS were more consistently documented than LOC and PTA. It is necessary to standardize screening processes between AC and IRF to identify dual diagnosis.", "doi": "10.1080/10790268.2017.1357105", "title": "Inconsistencies with Screening for Traumatic Brain Injury in Spinal Cord Injury across the Continuum of Care.", "journal": ["The journal of spinal cord medicine", "J Spinal Cord Med"]}
