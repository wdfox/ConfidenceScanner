The entire cohort was analyzed, as well as the PKP and DALK groups separately. Analysis of factors associated with a better outcome was also performed.Thirty-four eyes of 34 patients (20 PKP patients and 14 DALK patients) aged 47.4 \u00b1 15.9 years were included. Twenty-one patients underwent more than 1 ablation. Refractive stability and a minimal period of 5 months were required before repeat ablation. The average follow-up duration was 17.0 \u00b1 6.0 months. Corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) improved significantly from 0.22 \u00b1 0.14 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) to 0.14 \u00b1 0.12 logMAR at final follow-up (P = 0.035). Uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA) improved significantly from 0.90 \u00b1 0.54 logMAR to 0.57 \u00b1 0.40 logMAR at final follow-up (P = 0.004). CDVA and UDVA improved by \u22651 Snellen lines in 54.2% and 70.8% of the eyes, respectively, and by \u22653 Snellen lines in 16.7% and 54.2% of the eyes, respectively. Statistically significant improvement was seen in optical aberrometry indices (total root mean square, higher-order aberration root mean square, defocus, coma, trefoil, and spherical aberration). The difference between PKP and DALK in either CDVA (P = 0.562) or UDVA (P = 0.384) improvement was nonsignificant.The stepwise topography-guided photorefractive keratectomy approach in cases of irregular astigmatism after PKP or DALK can help improve visual acuity outcomes. Patients should be appropriately counseled that more than 1 treatment will likely be needed.", "doi": "10.1097/ICO.0000000000001359", "title": "Stepwise Guided Photorefractive Keratectomy in Treatment of Irregular Astigmatism After Penetrating Keratoplasty and Deep Anterior Lamellar Keratoplasty.", "journal": ["Cornea", "Cornea"]}
