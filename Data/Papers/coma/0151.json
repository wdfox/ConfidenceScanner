Materials and Methods \u2003This retrospective study examined 202 patients who during a 2-year period from 2011 and 2012 underwent surgical treatment for chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH). Information on patient age, sex, alcohol consumption, anticoagulant/antiplatelet treatment, history of head trauma, Glasgow coma scale (GCS), neurological symptoms, laterality of CSDH, and surgical technique was retrieved from patient charts. Results \u2003Overall, 27 out of 202 patients had a recurrence of CSDH and re-evacuation of the hematoma was performed. In all patients recurrence of neurological symptoms preceded the planned postoperative control brain CT 4 to 6 weeks after primary surgery. Conclusion \u2003Routinely postoperative control brain CT scan 4 to 6 weeks after the evacuation of a CSDH has no clinical value.", "doi": "10.1055/s-0037-1607215", "title": "No Value of Routine Brain Computed Tomography 6 Weeks after Evacuation of Chronic Subdural Hematoma.", "journal": ["Surgery journal (New York, N.Y.)", "Surg J (N Y)"]}
