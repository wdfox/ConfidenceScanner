Nineteen eyes had a history of open globe injury. The tilt and decentration of the IOLs and the visual quality were measured 1 month after surgery.The horizontal tilt and decentration of the IOLs in the open-globe-injury group were significantly higher than those in the control group (both P < 0.05). In the open-globe-injury group, the horizontal decentration was significantly greater in the limbus-sclera-involved group (n = 11) than in the only-cornea-involved group (n = 8, P = 0.040). The internal coma, 3rd-order, and total HOA values at pupil sizes of 4\u2009mm (P = 0.006) and 6\u2009mm (P = 0.013) were significantly higher in the open-globe-injury group than in the controls. Consequently, the optical quality data for the modulation transfer function and the Strehl ratio (all P < 0.05) were significantly poorer in the open-globe-injury group.Open globe injuries damage the structural integrity of the eyeball, resulting in more-misaligned sutured IOLs and poorer visual quality.", "doi": "10.1155/2017/3517461", "title": "Tilt, Decentration, and Internal Higher-Order Aberrations of Sutured Posterior-Chamber Intraocular Lenses in Patients with Open Globe Injuries.", "journal": ["Journal of ophthalmology", "J Ophthalmol"]}
