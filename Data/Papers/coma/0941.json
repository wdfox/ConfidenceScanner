We detected 1,268 HLA-A, -B and -DR, 409 HLA-A-B, 383 HLA-DR-B, and 218 HLA-A-DR haplotypes. The three loci were found to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium between the number of heterozygotes observed and the expected number, with p values of ;0.05.This study provides information on the allelic distribution of HLA class I and II in organ donors from the six regions in which Colombia is structurally divided to provide transplant services.", "doi": null, "title": "[Determination of HLA-A, -B and -DRB1 polymorphism in brain dead organ donors representative of the Colombian general population, 2007-2014].", "journal": ["Biomedica : revista del Instituto Nacional de Salud", "Biomedica"]}
