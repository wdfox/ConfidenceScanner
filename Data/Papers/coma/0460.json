The study represented in this manuscript aimed to describe gender differences in the mortality rates of trauma patients at the Puerto Rico Trauma Hospital (PRTH).This was a cross-sectional study performed at PRTH. A total of 14,874 injured patients admitted to the hospital from 2002 to 2011 were included in the sample and divided into 2 groups, based on sex. Pearson's chi-square test was employed for categorical variables and the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous ones. A logistic regression model was undertaken to estimate the association between gender and study outcomes, after adjusting for confounders. A p-value lower than 0.05 was an indication of statistical significance. IRB approval was received.The most common injury areas for women were the chest (32.50%), followed by the extremities (25.83%) and the head/neck (21.51%). Road traffic collisions (RTCs) (45.08%), falls (19.62%), and pedestrian accidents (16.08%) were the most common injury mechanisms for women. The highest frequency of RTC injuries (57.52%) among females occurred in patients who were from 18 to 39 years old. Females 65 years old and older exhibited the highest frequency of falls (39.78%) and pedestrian injuries (25.14%). Males 17 years and under were more likely to have an Injury Severity Score (ISS) of 15 or greater (AOR = 1.56; 95% CI: 1.19-2.03) than were their female counterparts; and, overall, males were more likely to have a Glasgow coma score (GCS) under 9 (AOR = 1.30; 95% CI: 1.11-1.53) than females were. Despite these results, there were no differences between gender mortality rates (AOR = 1.04; 95% CI: 0.86-1.25).Our results suggest that there is no sex dimorphism conferring protection on females. Future studies should be conducted to assess this issue.", "doi": null, "title": "Trauma Epidemiology of Women in Puerto Rico, 2002-2011.", "journal": ["Puerto Rico health sciences journal", "P R Health Sci J"]}
