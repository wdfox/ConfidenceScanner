Therefore, accidental and intentional ingestions with valproic acid are increasing.A case is presented in an adolescent with ischemic electrocardiographic changes after an acute overdose with VPA.Major features of a valproic acid overdose include respiratory depression, progressive coma, hepatotoxicity, thrombocytopenia, and hemodynamic instability. Electrocardiographic abnormalities usually consist of tachycardia and nonspecific changes. Supportive care is indicated in most overdoses and involves the monitoring and correction of electrolyte abnormalities, coagulopathies, and acid-base imbalances. Treatment may include activated charcoal, naloxone, l-carnitine, and extracorporeal detoxification.Valproic acid overdose is a relatively rare and electrocardiographic changes usually consist of tachycardia and nonspecific changes, but ischemic changes may occur and usually transient and require only recognition.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jemermed.2016.07.017", "title": "Valproic Acid Overdose Review of a Case With Electrocardiographic Changes.", "journal": ["The Journal of emergency medicine", "J Emerg Med"]}
