It also revealed that a significant percentage of elderly motorcycle riders do not wear a helmet. Compared to patients who had worn a helmet, patients who had not worn a helmet had a lower first Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, and a greater percentage presented with unconscious status (GCS score \u22648), had sustained subdural hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, cerebral contusion, severe injury (injury severity score 16-24 and \u226525), had longer hospital stay and higher mortality, and had required admission to the ICU.Elderly motorcycle riders tend to present with a higher injury severity, worse outcome, and a bodily injury pattern differing from that of adult motorcycle riders, indicating the need to emphasize use of protective equipment, especially helmets, to reduce their rate and severity of injury.", "doi": "10.1016/j.bj.2016.10.006", "title": "Motorcycle-related hospitalizations of the elderly.", "journal": ["Biomedical journal", "Biomed J"]}
