The aim of the study is to determine whether a larger optical diameter IOL will decrease the higher-order aberrations (HOAs) when the haptics are extended for intrascleral fixation than a smaller diameter IOL.Three-piece acrylic IOLs with 6.0\u00a0mm optics (X-60, VA-60BBR) and 7.0\u00a0mm optics (X-70, VA-70\u00a0AD) were fixed at lengths of 13, 14, 15, 16, or 17\u00a0mm. A wavefront analyzer was used to measure the HOAs within the central 3.0 and 5.2\u00a0mm optic diameter.The astigmatic aberration within the central 5.2\u00a0mm was greater than that within the central 3.0\u00a0mm for all IOLs. The HOAs increased significantly with an extension of the IOLs with both optical diameters (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The coma aberration within the central 5.2\u00a0mm was greater than that within the central 3.0\u00a0mm but it did not increase with an extension of the haptics. The astigmatic aberration of the X-60 IOL was significantly greater than that of the X-70 only at an extension of 17\u00a0mm. The astigmatic aberration of the VA-70\u00a0AD was not significantly different from that of the VA-60BBR. The cylindrical power changed from 0.047 D in the X-60 to 0.118 D in the VA-70\u00a0AD when the IOLs were extended from 13 to 17\u00a0mm.When three-piece IOLs are highly extended for intrascleral fixation, the astigmatic aberration increases significantly. However, IOLs with 7\u00a0mm optics do not have less astigmatic and coma aberrations than IOLs with 6\u00a0mm optics.", "doi": "10.1186/s12886-017-0478-3", "title": "Effects of optical diameter of intraocular lenses with intrascleral fixation on higher-order aberrations.", "journal": ["BMC ophthalmology", "BMC Ophthalmol"]}
