Additionally, enhancing quality of life will save enormous socio-economic costs; however, promising TBI treatment strategies with neuroprotective agents, such as citicoline (CDP-choline), lacked evidence or produced contradictory results in clinical trials. During a\u00a0prehospital TBI project to optimize early TBI care within 14\u00a0Austrian trauma centers, data on 778 TBI patients were prospectively collected. As preceding evaluations suggested a beneficial outcome in TBI patients treated at the Wiener Neustadt Hospital (WNH), we aimed to investigate the potential role of citicoline administration, solely applied in WNH, in those patients. In a\u00a0retrospective subgroup analysis we compared 67\u00a0patients from WNH with citicoline administration and 67\u00a0matched patients from other Austrian centers without citicoline use. Patients with Glasgow Coma Scale score <13 on site and/or Abbreviated Injury Scale of the region \"head\" >2 were included. Our analysis revealed significantly reduced rates of intensive care unit (ICU) mortality (5% vs. 24%, p\u00a0< 0.01), in-hospital mortality (9% vs. 24%, p\u00a0= 0.035) and 6\u2011month mortality (13% vs. 28%, p\u00a0= 0.031), as well as of unfavorable outcome (34% vs. 57%, p\u00a0= 0.015) and observed vs. expected ratio for mortality (0.42 vs. 0.84) in the WNH (citicoline receivers) group. Despite the limitations of a\u00a0retrospective subgroup analysis our findings suggest a\u00a0possible correlation between early and consequent citicoline administration and beneficial outcomes. Therefore, we aim to set up an initiative for a\u00a0prospective, multicenter randomized controlled trial with citicoline in sTBI (severe TBI) patients.", "doi": "10.1007/s00508-017-1240-9", "title": "Citicoline in severe traumatic brain injury: indications for improved outcome : A\u00a0retrospective matched pair analysis from 14\u00a0Austrian trauma centers.", "journal": ["Wiener klinische Wochenschrift", "Wien.
