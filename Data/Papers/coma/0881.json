This study compared bilateral ASPECTS (ASPECTS-b) with the gray:white matter ratio (GWR) and quantitative regional abnormality (QRA) to evaluate the prognostic utility of early computed tomography (CT) findings in post-cardiac arrest patients.Methods\u2004and\u2004Results:Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) who underwent brain CT (<6 h after onset) and therapeutic hypothermia were recruited from a university hospital over a 2-year period. General demographics, ROSC characteristics, ASPECTS-b (total score=20 points), GWR, and QRA were assessed. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to predict neurologic outcome using cerebral performance category (CPC) at 1 month. The study population was divided into good (n=20; CPC 1-2) and poor (n=47; CPC 3-5) outcome groups. The good (vs. poor) outcome group was younger (mean [\u00b1SD] age 46.7\u00b111.8 vs. 60.3\u00b117.2 years; P=0.002) and had more initial shockable rhythms (40.0% vs. 8.5%; P=0.002). In addition, the good outcome group had a higher mean ASPECTS-b score (15.3\u00b12.7 vs. 9.0\u00b14.9; P<0.001), despite no differences in QRA and mean GWR. Age and ASPECTS-b were independent predictors of outcome after adjusting for potential confounders.These findings suggest that an initial CT score (ASPECTS-b) could help estimate early neurologic outcomes in post-cardiac arrest patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia.", "doi": "10.1253/circj.CJ-16-1327", "title": "Useful Computed Tomography Score for Estimation of Early Neurologic Outcome in Post-Cardiac Arrest Patients With Therapeutic Hypothermia.", "journal": ["Circulation journal : official journal of the Japanese Circulation Society", "Circ.
