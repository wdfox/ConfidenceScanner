Changes in visual acuity, refraction, higher-order aberrations, and ocular scattering index (OSI) were evaluated during a 3-month follow-up. The Alpins method was used to analyze the astigmatic changes.A significant reduction was observed in refraction (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001), with significant improvement in uncorrected (UDVA) and corrected (CDVA) distance visual acuities (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). All eyes had a spherical equivalent within \u00b10.50 diopter (D) and UDVA of 20/25 or better at 90\u00a0days after surgery. A total of 27.3% of eyes gained lines of CDVA. No significant changes were observed in primary coma and spherical aberration (P\u00a0\u2265\u00a0.551). Likewise, no significant changes were observed in OSI (P\u00a0=\u00a0.361), with a mean 90-day postoperative value of 0.66\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.58 (SD). A significant change to negative values of the magnitude of error (P\u00a0=\u00a0.007) and a significant decrease in the correction index (P\u00a0=\u00a0.004) were observed during the follow-up, with mean 90-day postoperative values of -0.24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.28 D and 0.86\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.17 D, respectively.Wavefront-guided LASIK using a high-resolution aberrometer provided safe and efficacious correction of myopic astigmatism, with preservation of the ocular optical quality.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jcrs.2017.08.020", "title": "Vector analysis of astigmatic changes and optical quality outcomes after wavefront-guided laser in\u00a0situ keratomileusis using a high-resolution aberrometer.", "journal": ["Journal of cataract and refractive surgery", "J Cataract Refract Surg"]}
