Clinical outcome was assessed immediately postoperatively using Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), and at 12 months using the modified Rankin scale (mRS) and Barthel index. Survival was evaluated at thirty-days and one year after surgery.Six out of 10 patients diagnosed with malignant MCA infarction underwent DH. Among the surgically treated patients (n=6), 4 were males (66%), and the median age was 22.5 years. The median time from admission to surgery was 35.5 hours. The median post-operative GCS was 6.5. Three patients (50%) died within 30 days of DH. In those who survived, the median mRS was 4.5 and BI was 7.5.Decompressive hemicraniectomy saves life and has the potential of improving survival functional outcome when done fast and in carefully selected patients. We call for national awareness of the management of such cases and early intervention.", "doi": null, "title": "Decompressive hemicraniectomy for malignant middle cerebral artery infarction.
