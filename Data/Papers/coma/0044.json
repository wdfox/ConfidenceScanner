None of patients included in this analysis underwent therapeutic hypothermia (TH). Neurological outcome was expressed as the best score 6 months after CRA using the five-point Glasgow-Pisttsburgh Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC) RESULTS: Twenty-six patients were identified with a diagnosis of postanoxic AC, TC or ATC coma. There were 20 (77%) men and 6 (23%) women. The mean age was 63\u202f\u00b1\u202f16\u202fyears. The most frequent EEG pattern was TC (21 patients, 80%), followed by AC (3 patients, 12%) and ATC (2 patients, 8%). The cardiac rhythm as primary origin of the CRA was ventricular fibrillation (VF) in 16 patients (61.5%), asystole in 8 patients (34.6%) and ventricular tachycardia (VT) in one patient (3.8%). The presence of EEG reactivity was present in 8 patients (30%). The mortality rate was 85%. Of the 4 surviving patients, two (3.8%) had moderate disability (CPC 2), one (3.8%) had severe disability (CPC 3) and one (3.8%) reached a good recovery. The age was significantly lower in survivors 46.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f10.8 versus nonsurvivors 63.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f15.5 (p\u202f=\u202f0.04). There was increased association of EEG reactivity with survival (p\u202f=\u202f0.07).Hypoxic-ischemic AC, TC and ATC are associated with a poor prognosis and a high rate of mortality. In younger patients with AC, TC and ATC and incomplete forms showing reactivity on the EEG, there is a greater probability of clinical recovery.", "doi": "10.1016/j.resuscitation.2017.12.022", "title": "Postanoxic alpha, theta or alpha-theta coma: Clinical setting and neurological outcome.", "journal": ["Resuscitation", "Resuscitation"]}
