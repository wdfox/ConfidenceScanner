Involuntary movements were not observed, and bilateral Babinski signs were inconclusive. Diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) of the brain showed bilateral hyperintensity in the thalamus and internal capsule, laboratory testing detected high levels of plasma ammonia, and an electroencephalogram showed delta waves and triphasic waves predominantly in the frontal lobe. Based on these results, treatment for hepatic encephalopathy was administered, which led to an improvement in consciousness level, a decrease in plasma ammonia levels, and a normalization in the DWI scan. Abdominal computed tomography scan showed no abnormality in the liver, but revealed an abnormal blood vessel leading from the ileocolic vein to the inferior vena cava; the patient was diagnosed with portal-systemic encephalopathy. In deep coma patients, acute encephalopathy with hyperammonemia is important for differential diagnosis when DWI shows high-density legions in the thalamus and internal capsule.", "doi": "10.5692/clinicalneurol.cn-001068", "title": "[Portal-systemic encephalopathy with bilateral thalamic and internal capsule lesions using diffusion-weighted MRI in a super-aged patient].", "journal": ["Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology", "Rinsho Shinkeigaku"]}
