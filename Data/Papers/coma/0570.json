Her Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) fell to 4 and she was transferred to the intensive care unit. The patient was reviewed by multiple specialists and multiple differentials were considered and eliminated. Eventually, investigations revealed hyperammonaemic encephalopathy, being a result of low arginine and potentially small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Following treatment with sodium benzoate, sodium phenylbutyrate and arginine along with haemodialysis and rifaximin, GCS and hyperammonaemia rapidly improved. She was stepped down to surgical high-dependency unit, continued arginine therapy with total parenteral nutrition and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy feeds. She was discharged with regular follow-up from surgeons and biochemistry and continues oral arginine therapy.", "doi": "10.1136/bcr-2017-221458", "title": "Hyperammonaemic encephalopathy following an uncomplicated surgery.", "journal": ["BMJ case reports", "BMJ Case Rep"]}
