Clinical presentation to the emergency department ranges from headache with vomiting to coma. In addition to managing the ABCs, the crux of emergency management lies in stopping hematoma expansion and other complications to prevent clinical deterioration. This may be achieved primarily through anticoagulation reversal, blood pressure, empiric management of intracranial pressure, and early neurosurgical consultation for posterior fossa hemorrhage. Patients must be admitted to intensive care. The effects of intracerebral hemorrhage are potentially devastating with very poor prognoses for functional outcome and mortality.", "doi": "10.1016/j.emc.2017.07.002", "title": "Spontaneous Intracerebral Hemorrhage.", "journal": ["Emergency medicine clinics of North America", "Emerg.
