A 76-year-old woman presented with severe headache and subsequent loss of consciousness and was admitted to our hospital. Initial computed tomography showed subarachnoid hemorrhage. Three-dimensional digital subtraction angiography revealed a saccular aneurysm arising from the right vertebral artery (VA)-PICA bifurcation. The PICA branching from the right VA was enlarged, tortuous, and crossed the midline to supply both cerebellar hemispheres. This right PICA was interpreted as a bihemispheric PICA. Recognizing this variant preoperatively could help prevent complications of surgery. Careful follow-up studies are necessary in cases with bihemispheric PICA to monitor for the development of aneurysm at the junction between the bihemispheric PICA and the VA or the distal portion of the bihemispheric PICA.", "doi": "10.4103/jnrp.jnrp_285_17", "title": "Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Due to Ruptured Intracranial Aneurysm Arising from a Vertebral Artery-Bihemispheric Posterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery Bifurcation.", "journal": ["Journal of neurosciences in rural practice", "J Neurosci Rural Pract"]}
