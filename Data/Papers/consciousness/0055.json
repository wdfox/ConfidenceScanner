Yet, the combination of several symptoms may be highly indicative of PNES. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that some combinations of symptoms are more easily recorded and that some are more indicative of PNES. We review and analize various symptom combinations including convulsions, falling, and impaired consciousness. Further, we examine and discuss all individual symptoms that are known to be associated with PNES.", "doi": "10.11477/mf.1416200925", "title": "[Diagnosis of Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizure: How Can We Detect It Prior to Video-Electroencephalography Monitoring].", "journal": ["Brain and nerve = Shinkei kenkyu no shinpo", "Brain Nerve"]}
