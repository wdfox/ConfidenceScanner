Previous studies have demonstrated that thalamocortical system is critical for information transmission and integration in the brain. The ventral posteromedial nucleus (VPM) is a critical component of thalamocortical system. Glutamate is an important excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain and may be involved in ketamine-induced LOC.The study used whole-cell patch-clamp to observe the effect of ketamine (30\u00a0\u03bcM-1000\u00a0\u03bcM) on glutamatergic neurotransmission in VPM slices.Ketamine significantly decreased the amplitude of glutamatergic spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs), but only higher concentration of ketamine (300\u00a0\u03bcM and 1000\u00a0\u03bcM) suppressed the frequency of sEPSCs. Ketamine (100\u00a0\u03bcM-1000\u00a0\u03bcM) also decreased the amplitude of glutamatergic miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs), without altering the frequency.In VPM neurons, ketamine attenuates the glutamatergic neurotransmission mainly through postsynaptic mechanism and action potential may be involved in the process.", "doi": "10.1186/s12871-017-0404-5", "title": "Ketamine attenuates the glutamatergic neurotransmission in the ventral posteromedial nucleus slices of rats.", "journal": ["BMC anesthesiology", "BMC Anesthesiol"]}
