A number of etiologies and risk factors for CVT have been identified so far. These include head trauma, local and systemic infectious diseases, malignancies, autoimmune diseases, and oral contraceptive use. The most common clinical symptoms are headache and changes in consciousness. Cranial nerve palsy in CVT is uncommon, and there are very few reports of facial nerve palsy. This case report highlights an atypical manifestation in a CVT patient, who presented with peripheral facial palsy. The patient was successfully treated with anticoagulation.", "doi": "10.4103/jpn.JPN_155_16", "title": "Facial Palsy in Cerebral Venous Thrombosis: An Atypical Case in a Young Girl.", "journal": ["Journal of pediatric neurosciences", "J Pediatr Neurosci"]}
