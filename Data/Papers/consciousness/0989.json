These patients developed sub-acute onset of disorientation and disturbance of consciousness following several weeks of poor intake. Peripheral neuropathy of varying severity was noted before and after the onset of WE. Brain MRI of the patients showed cerebellar vermis and symmetric cortical abnormalities in addition to typical WE changes. Electrophysiological studies demonstrated axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy. Prompt thiamine supplement therapy was initiated and both patients gradually recovered, however mild amnesia was still noted 6\u00a0months later. We reviewed non- alcoholic WE with atypical cortical abnormalities in English language literatures and identified 29 more cases. Eight out of 31 (25.8%) patients died during follow-up. Nine patients with gait disturbance or motor paresis had showed hyporeflexia in neurological examinations. In addition to classic triad, seizure was recorded in seven patients. Dietary deprivation is a risk factor for non-alcoholic WE among elderly patients receiving gastrointestinal surgery. The prognosis is good after thiamine supplement therapy. Recognizing the MRI features and predisposing factors in patients who have undergone gastrectomy can aid in the diagnosis and management.", "doi": "10.1007/s11011-017-0055-8", "title": "Non-alcoholic Wernicke's encephalopathy with cortical involvement and polyneuropathy following gastrectomy.", "journal": ["Metabolic brain disease", "Metab Brain Dis"]}
