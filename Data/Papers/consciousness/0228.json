Follow-up after discharge was performed.Ninety patients were evaluated. Acute symptomatic etiology was the most prevalent. The mean number of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) used was 2.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2, and 21% of the patients required sedation. A poor outcome was considered when death (31.1%) or developing of new neurological impairment at discharge (32.2%) occurred. After multivariate analysis, four variables predicted a poor outcome: acute symptomatic etiology (OR: 6.320; 95% CI: 1.976-20.217; P\u00a0=\u00a0.002), focal motor SE type (OR: 9.089; 95% CI: 2.482-33.283; P\u00a0=\u00a0.001), level of consciousness (OR: 4.596; 95% CI: 1.903-11.098; P\u00a0=\u00a0.001), and SE duration >12\u00a0hours (OR: 3.763; 95% CI: 1.130-12.530; P\u00a0=\u00a0.031). Independent predictive factors of mortality were SE duration >12\u00a0hours (OR: 4.306; 95% CI: 1.044-17.757; P\u00a0=\u00a0.043), modified Status Epilepticus Severity Score (mSTESS) (OR: 2.216; 95% CI: 1.313-3.740; P\u00a0=\u00a0.003), and development of complications (OR: 3.334; 95% CI: 1.004-11.070, P\u00a0=\u00a0.049). Considering long-term mortality, age (HR 1.036; 95% CI 1.001-1.071; P\u00a0=\u00a0.044), a potentially fatal underlying cause (HR 2.609; 95% CI 1.497- 4.548; P\u00a0=\u00a0.001), and mSTESS score >4 (HR 1.485; 95% CI 1.158-1.903; P\u00a0=\u00a0.002) remained as predictive factors. There was no association between sedation and the number of AEDs used with outcome at discharge or long-term mortality (P\u00a0>\u00a0.05).SE above 70\u00a0years old has a high morbimortality.
