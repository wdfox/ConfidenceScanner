Due to high co-morbidity, health related quality of life in a significant proportion of CDH patients might be compromised. As a consequence of consciousness on the long-term sequelae of CDH survivors, and their consequences for life, several follow-up programs were brought to life worldwide. In this review, we will summarize the long-term sequelae of CDH survivors, the impact of new treatments, and analyze the consistency of follow-up programs.", "doi": "10.1053/j.sempedsurg.2017.09.002", "title": "Long-term morbidity of congenital diaphragmatic hernia: A plea for standardization.", "journal": ["Seminars in pediatric surgery", "Semin.
