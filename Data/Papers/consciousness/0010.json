Starting from a network model of Kuramoto phase oscillators, which evolve adaptively according to homophilic and homeostatic adaptive principles, we give evidence that the increase of synchronization within groups of nodes (and the corresponding formation of synchronous clusters) causes also the defragmentation of the wavelet energy spectrum of the macroscopic signal. Our methodology is then applied to getting a glance into the microscopic interactions occurring in a neurophysiological system, namely, in the thalamocortical neural network of an epileptic brain of a rat, where the group electrical activity is registered by means of multichannel EEG. We demonstrate that it is possible to infer the degree of interaction between the interconnected regions of the brain during different types of brain activities and to estimate the regions' participation in the generation of the different levels of consciousness.", "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevE.96.012316", "title": "Macroscopic and microscopic spectral properties of brain networks during local and global synchronization.", "journal": ["Physical review.
