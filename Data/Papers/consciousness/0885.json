However, the nurses reported greater confidence in teaching this technique to patients ( p < .001).As a strategy for self-care in the workplace, nurses were receptive to learning the RR and reported confidence in using this strategy for their patients. Larger studies may reveal more significant reductions in workplace stress and anxiety for nurses.", "doi": "10.1177/0898010117719207", "title": "The Effects of the Relaxation Response on Nurses' Level of Anxiety, Depression, Well-Being, Work-Related Stress, and Confidence to Teach Patients.", "journal": ["Journal of holistic nursing : official journal of the American Holistic Nurses' Association", "J Holist Nurs"]}
