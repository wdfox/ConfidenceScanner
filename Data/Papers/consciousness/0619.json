Recently, a closed loop stimulation (CLS) pacing system has emerged as a new strategy which appears superior to conventional pacing for patients with refractory syncope. However, its efficacy remains of considerable debate and large randomized controlled clinical trials are needed. Between 2002 and 2017, 12 total studies evaluated the use of CLS pacing in patients with refractory VVS, and are summarized in this article.", "doi": "10.1111/pace.13194", "title": "Role of closed loop stimulation pacing (CLS) in vasovagal syncope.", "journal": ["Pacing and clinical electrophysiology : PACE", "Pacing Clin Electrophysiol"]}
