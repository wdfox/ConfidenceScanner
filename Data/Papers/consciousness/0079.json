This paper surveys and analyses these portrayals for the first time.Methods Relevant paintings, prints, sculptures, and installations were identified by means of keyword searches in search engines, OPACs and picture libraries as well as handsearch.Results Between 1914 and 2014 more than 75 works of art with dental treatment as a motif appeared across the globe. Virtually every modern style from post-impressionism to 'crossover art' are represented, including world famous artists such as Dubuffet or Dal\u00ed. Syringes, Doriot's transmissions and contra-angle handpieces are worked into an iconographic code. In contrast, elements of an increasing hygiene consciousness (gloves, face masks and protective glasses) are integrated only fragmentarily. The dentist-patient relationship is predominantly portrayed professionally and realistically and the stereotype of the male dentist dominates.Discussion For almost a century it has been argued that dentists in action had largely disappeared from artistic production after 1900. The results presented here force a revision of this idea and encourage the further discovery of pictorial sources. Only in this way can the fascinating theme of 'dentistry in art' become an attractive part of dental humanities.", "doi": "10.1038/sj.bdj.2017.998", "title": "Dental care in modern art (1914-2014).", "journal": ["British dental journal", "Br Dent J"]}
