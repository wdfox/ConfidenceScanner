As life itself arises from coordinated interactions between elements across the periodic table, the majority of which are metals, new approaches for analysis, binding, and control of these primary chemical entities can help enrich our understanding of inorganic chemistry in living systems in a context that is both universal and personal.", "doi": "10.1021/acs.accounts.6b00531", "title": "Bioinorganic Life and Neural Activity: Toward a Chemistry of Consciousness?", "journal": ["Accounts of chemical research", "Acc.
