A 60-year-old man developed sudden left hemiparesis due to IS. During tPA infusion, his blood pressure dropped and consciousness declined. After transfer to our hospital, carotid duplex ultrasonography led to a diagnosis of AD. Emergency surgery was postponed because of the risk of hemorrhagic transformation. The patient successfully underwent aortic surgery on day 5 and was discharged with a remarkable improvement in his symptoms. Delayed surgery may avoid hemorrhagic transformation in patients with AD-induced IS who have received tPA.", "doi": "10.2169/internalmedicine.8438-16", "title": "Successful Delayed Aortic Surgery for a Patient with Ischemic Stroke Secondary to Aortic Dissection.", "journal": ["Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)", "Intern.
