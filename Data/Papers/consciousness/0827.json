The intubating conditions and hemodynamic responses were evaluated. The time from sevoflurane induction to loss of consciousness, to intravenous line insertion, and to intubation was measured. The occurrence of any adverse effect was recorded.Results were analyzed using Student's t-test, paired t-test, and Chi-square test. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.The incidence of excellent intubating conditions was achieved more significantly in Group II (41/45 patients, 91%) than that in Group I (31/45 patients, 69%) (P = 0.008) (95% confidence interval [CI] =0.39-0.8). Whereas, there were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of the overall acceptable intubating conditions in Group I (40/45 patients, 89%) and Group II (43/45 patients, 96%) (P = 0.81) (95% CI = 0.71-1.31). No patient developed any adverse effect.The administration of 3 mg/kg propofol preceded by 2 \u03bcg/kg fentanyl provided a higher proportion of excellent intubating conditions compared with 2 mg/kg propofol preceded by 2 \u03bcg/kg fentanyl during sevoflurane induction in children without muscle relaxants.", "doi": "10.4103/1658-354X.206802", "title": "Using fentanyl and propofol for tracheal intubation during sevoflurane induction without muscle relaxants in children: A randomized prospective study.", "journal": ["Saudi journal of anaesthesia", "Saudi J Anaesth"]}
