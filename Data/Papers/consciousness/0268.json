The evaluation illustrates that Newman's theory is valuable for guiding various aspects of nursing practice, education, and research. However, its use had been limited to spiritual, psychological, and social aspects of nursing care and needs to be further evaluated for its significance in acute care settings. Most of the studies that use Newman's theory are from the past, with limited studies conducted in recent years, indicating the need for further research.", "doi": "10.1891/1078-4535.23.4.207", "title": "Finding Patterns of Meaning: Margaret Newman's Theory of Health as Expanding Consciousness.", "journal": ["Creative nursing", "Creat Nurs"]}
