In this paper, we propose a critical antidiscriminatory pedagogy (CADP) for nursing as a promising path in this direction. We argue that because discrimination is inherent to the production and maintenance of inequities and injustices, adopting a CADP offers opportunities for students and practicing nurses to develop their capacity to counteract racism and other forms of individual and systemic discrimination in health care, and thus promote social justice. The CADP we propose has the following features: it is grounded in a critical intersectional perspective of discrimination, it aims at fostering transformative learning, and it involves a praxis-oriented critical consciousness. A CADP challenges the liberal individualist paradigm that dominates much of western-based health care, and the culturalist and racializing processes prevalent in nursing education. It also situates nursing practice as responsive to health inequities. Thus, a CADP is a promising way to translate social justice into nursing practice and education through transformative learning.", "doi": "10.1111/nin.12211", "title": "Drawing on antiracist approaches toward a critical antidiscriminatory pedagogy for nursing.", "journal": ["Nursing inquiry", "Nurs Inq"]}
