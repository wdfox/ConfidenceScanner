We review the three principles and explain how exposure to these principles can lead to improved mental health and improved behavior. Then, we describe 3PCC and distinguish it from prevailing correctional counseling methods. Finally, we present a preliminary study that examines the efficacy of 3PCC for improving the mental health and behavior of people in an English prison. Our findings show that participants exposed to 3PCC showed a significant improvement in mental well-being and purpose in life, significant reductions in anxiety and anger, and improved behavior in the prison community.", "doi": "10.1177/0306624X17735253", "title": "Teaching Health versus Treating Illness: The Efficacy of Three Principles Correctional Counseling with People in an English Prison.", "journal": ["International journal of offender therapy and comparative criminology", "Int J Offender Ther Comp Criminol"]}
