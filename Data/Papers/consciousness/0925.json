Cerebral malaria is a disease characterized by alterations in consciousness and epileptic attacks; therefore, it requires a rapid evaluation and quick intervention. It may progress to a fatal outcome despite administering targeted therapeutic interventions. There are studies indicating that erythrocyte exchange (erythrocytapheresis) can be a treatment modality for managing severe malaria patients. In this case report, the successful management of a cerebral malaria patient by the combination of antimalarial drug therapy and erythrocyte exchange is presented.", "doi": "10.5152/tpd.2017.4704", "title": "A Case of Cerebral Malaria Managed by Erythrocyte Exchange.", "journal": ["Turkiye parazitolojii dergisi", "Turkiye Parazitol Derg"]}
