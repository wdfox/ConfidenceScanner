From his early writing on the regulation of house staff work hours and his abandonment of essentialism and the development of clinical pragmatism as a method of moral problem-solving to his scholarship on end-of-life care and disorders of consciousness, time has been a central heuristic in an effort to bridge ethical theory and clinical practice.", "doi": "10.1353/pbm.2017.0016", "title": "My Time in Medicine.", "journal": ["Perspectives in biology and medicine", "Perspect.
