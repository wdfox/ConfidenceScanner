The aim of this study was to assess the outcome of the transsphenoidal approach for PA in a large surgical experience.Each consecutive case of PA consecutively operated by endoscopic endonasal approach from our tertiary care center, from 1998 to 2015, was included in this series.Seventy-five patients (47 male; mean age 52.4\u00a0\u00b1 16.2 years) were included. Mean follow-up was 69.3 \u00b1 46.7 months. On admission, all patients presented with abrupt severe headache (100%), associated with anterior hypopituitarism in 51 patients (68%), visual disturbances in 55 (73.4%), ophthalmoplegia in 38 (50.7%), and a remarkable reduction of consciousness in 2 (2.6%). Apoplexy proved to be ischemic in 35 patients (46.7%) and hemorrhagic in 40 (53.3%). Patients with hemorrhagic necrosis presented more often with major suprasellar expansion (P = 0.012) Radical removal was achieved in 60 cases (80%). Surgical morbidity consisted in one case of postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leak (1.3%). Anterior hypopituitarism worsened in 15 cases (20%), and diabetes insipidus occurred in 4 cases (5.3%). Ophthalmoplegia improved/normalized in 71% and visual symptoms in 85.5% of the patients, with better results achieved in ischemic forms (P = 0.043). The 2\u00a0comatose patients regained normal consciousness.The endoscopic endonasal approach represents a valid, effective, and safe technique in the management of PA. Favorable outcomes can be achieved by referring patients to dedicated pituitary centers with a multidisciplinary team. Further studies are still needed to define criteria for surgical indication and to identify outcome predictors.", "doi": "10.1016/j.wneu.2017.06.117", "title": "Endoscopic Endonasal Surgery for Pituitary Apoplexy: Evidence On a 75-Case Series From a Tertiary Care Center.", "journal": ["World neurosurgery", "World Neurosurg"]}
