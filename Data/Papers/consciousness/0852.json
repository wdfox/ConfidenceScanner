MRI of the brain revealed a new infarction in the left corona radiata, and intravenous rt-PA was administered 100 minutes after the onset of symptoms. After the rt-PA infusion was started, his consciousness declined and the CT revealed bilateral intracerebral hemorrhage. His consciousness did not improve thereafter. He was diagnosed with ANCA-associated vasculitis owing to the high levels of MPO-ANCA and urinary protein and the presence of erythrocytes without any other cause of renal damage. Although ANCA-associated vasculitis rarely involves the central nervous system, intracerebral hemorrhage as well as cerebral infarction may occur. This case provides an important opportunity to explore the implications of intravenous rt-PA therapy for acute cerebral infarction in patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis.", "doi": "10.5692/clinicalneurol.cn-001011", "title": "Intracerebral hemorrhage after intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) therapy for acute cerebral infarction in a patient with ANCA-associated vasculitis.", "journal": ["Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology", "Rinsho Shinkeigaku"]}
