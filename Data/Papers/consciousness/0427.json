On neurologic examination, the pupils were reactive, brainstem reflexes were present and plantar responses were flexor bilaterally. Routine laboratory tests were unremarkable. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed a mixed acidosis. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain and angio-CT were normal. The family confirmed that the patient had had suicidal ideation, and they had discovered a bag of slug killer (metaldehyde 5%) in her room. Two hours after the admission at the ICU, her neurological state remained unchanged. Sedation with intravenous propofol and antiepileptic therapy with levetiracetam (1000\u202fmg/24\u202fh) were started. The next day, propofol infusion was stopped but the level of consciousness of the patient did not improve. A video-electroencephalograhy (v-EEG) showed continuous generalized paroxysms of spike-wave and sharp-slow wave complexes compatible with the diagnosis of generalized NCSE. On day 3, the episode of NCSE was controlled. Finally, 15\u202fdays after ICU admission she was discharged with a normal neurological examination.This clinical case highlights that in comatose patients as consequence of metaldehyde poisoning, a v-EEG evaluation should be perform in order to rule out the existence of NCSE.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jocn.2017.10.017", "title": "Super-refractory nonconvulsive status epilepticus due to self-poisoning with metaldehyde.", "journal": ["Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia", "J Clin Neurosci"]}
