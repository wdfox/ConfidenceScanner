These cysts often have a well-defined cyst wall, mucinous or watery intracystic fluid and have a fairly good plane with the surrounding parenchyma. Occasionally, intracystic haemorrhage can lead to xanthogranulomatous inflammatory changes within the cyst resulting in focal thickening of the cyst wall and adhesion to the surrounding structures. Here we describe a case of xanthogranulomatous colloid cyst which is a very rare variant of colloid cyst.", "doi": "10.1177/1971400917703988", "title": "Xanthogranulomatous colloid cyst of the third ventricle: Alter your surgical strategy.", "journal": ["The neuroradiology journal", "Neuroradiol J"]}
