FLAIR images showed diffuse high intensity areas in the bilateral thalamus, basal ganglia, and white matter. Chest CT revealed a mass in the right lung. The patient was diagnosed with extranodal natural killer/T cell lymphoma (ENKL) according to the results of a biopsy of the right pulmonary mass. The FLAIR images showed diffuse white matter lesions, without a mass such as lymphomatosis cerebri. On diffusion-weighted images, symmetrical high-intensity lesions of the cerebral peduncle and the internal capsule suggested high-density lymphoma cells around neurons. ENKL of the central nervous system and lung is a very rare neoplasm, and this case showed characteristic images.", "doi": "10.5692/clinicalneurol.cn-001076", "title": "[Symmetrical lesions of the cerebral peduncles and internal capsules on MRI in a patient with extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma].", "journal": ["Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology", "Rinsho Shinkeigaku"]}
