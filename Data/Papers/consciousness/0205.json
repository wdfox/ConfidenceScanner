In particular, the foundations of adult education philosophy and adult learning theories can be deliberately applied to further strengthen the clinical learning experience of physician assistants (PAs). We propose that PA educators should be aware of how their personal philosophy of education affects their teaching practice. In addition, educators should apply learning theories to both classroom process and content. We provide an overview of 5 categories of learning philosophy (liberal, progressive, behavioral, humanist, and radical) and 6 learning theories (experiential learning, reflective practice, situated learning, communities of practice, transformative learning, and critical consciousness) of adult education. Concrete examples of how to apply adult education theory to meet specific learning objectives for PA students are described. Understanding how to apply learning theory and identify and shape one's educational philosophy provides theoretical and empirical support for what we often deem an intuitive process.", "doi": "10.1097/JPA.0000000000000172", "title": "Application of Adult Learning Theory to Physician Assistant Education.", "journal": ["The journal of physician assistant education : the official journal of the Physician Assistant Education Association", "J Physician Assist Educ"]}
