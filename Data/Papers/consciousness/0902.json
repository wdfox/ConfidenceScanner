Reanalysis of those data confirmed the presence of a time-synchronous, statistically significant correlation in brain electrical activity of these distant \"sender-receiver\" pairs. Given the sensory shielding employed in the original experiment to avoid mundane explanations for such a correlation, this outcome is suggestive of an anomalous intersubjective connection.", "doi": "10.12688/f1000research.11537.1", "title": "Electrocortical correlations between pairs of isolated people: A reanalysis.", "journal": ["F1000Research", "F1000Res"]}
