She suffered a minor head trauma and deteriorated to deep unconsciousness. A CT revealed an acute subdural haematoma (ASDH). Initially, she was not found to be a candidate for neurosurgical intervention, but within 24 hours her level of consciousness improved dramatically, and a renewed CT showed resolution of the ASDH. She underwent acute craniotomy with good outcome. This illustrates the importance of re-evaluation of patients with intracranial haemorrhage.", "doi": null, "title": "[Rapid resolution of acute subdural haematoma with significant impact on clinical outcome].", "journal": ["Ugeskrift for laeger", "Ugeskr.
