It is defined as transient loss of consciousness with loss of postural tone, which is usually self-limited and followed by a spontaneous recovery. Our report describes a case of cough syncope resulting from chronic intractable cough caused by post nasal drip. Although his experience was debilitating, we were able to control his symptoms significantly using a small dose of Gabapentin. This dose is much lower when compared with the already established licensed indicated higher doses used for the treatment of neuropathic pain and epilepsy. Cough syncope is a demanding condition that results in comprehensive costly investigations. In addition, cough syncope could be misinterpreted as epilepsy by the treating team. Pulmonologists should be aware of the use of Gabapentin as the management of cough refractory to standard antitussive therapy. Further studies are needed to assess the effectiveness of low doses of Gabapentin in the management of chronic cough.", "doi": "10.1016/j.rmcr.2017.06.009", "title": "Cough syncope induced by post nasal drip successfully managed by Gabapentin.", "journal": ["Respiratory medicine case reports", "Respir Med Case Rep"]}
