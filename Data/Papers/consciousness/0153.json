Using the DPV Diabetes Prospective follow-up data, we analyzed frequency and timing of recurrent SH (defined as requiring assistance from another person) and HC (loss of consciousness or seizures) in 14\u2009177 youths with type 1 diabetes aged <20 years and at least 5\u2009years of follow-up.Among 14\u2009177 patients with type 1 diabetes, 72% (90%) had no, 14% (6.8%) had 1 and 14% (3.2%) >1 SH (HC). SH or HC in the last year of observation was highest with SH in the previous year (odds ratio [OR] 4.7 [CI 4.0-5.5]/4.6 [CI 3.6-6.0]), but remained elevated even 4\u2009years after an episode (OR 2.0 [CI 1.6-2.7]/2.2 [CI 1.5-3.1]). The proportion of patients who experienced SH or HC during the last year of observation was highest with SH/HC recorded during the previous year (23% for SH and 13% for HC) and lowest in those with no event (4.6% for SH and 2% for HC) in the initial 4\u2009years of observation.Even 4\u2009years after an episode of SH/HC, risk for SH/HC remains higher compared to children who never experienced SH/HC. Clinicians should continue to regularly track hypoglycemia history at every visit, adjust diabetes education and therapy in order to avoid recurrences.", "doi": "10.1111/pedi.12610", "title": "Risk of recurrent severe hypoglycemia remains associated with a past history of severe hypoglycemia up to 4\u2009years: Results from a large prospective contemporary pediatric cohort of the DPV initiative.", "journal": ["Pediatric diabetes", "Pediatr Diabetes"]}
