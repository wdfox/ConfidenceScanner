For instance, asked how many legs a horse has, Ganser patients will reply \"5\", and answers to plain arithmetic questions will likewise be wrong, but only slightly off the mark (e.g., 2 + 2 = 3). This symptom was originally described by Sigbert Ganser in 1897 in prisoners on remand and labeled Vorbeigehen (\"to pass by\"), although the term Vorbeireden (\"to talk beside the point\") is also frequently used. A number of associated symptoms were also reported: \"clouding of consciousness,\" somatoform conversion disorder, hallucinations, sudden and spontaneous recovery, subsequent amnesia for the episode, premorbid traumatic psychosocial experience and/or (usually mild) head trauma. Etiological, epidemiological and diagnostic issues have never been resolved for Ganser's syndrome. Ganser saw it as a form of \"twilight hysteria,\" whereas others suggested that malingering, psychosis or dissociation were more appropriate labels, oftentimes combined with organic impairment and a subjectively intolerable psychosocial context. A central conundrum of Ganser's syndrome is whether it could simultaneously be a cultural and pathological representation of insanity, whereas cognitive, organic, affective, motivational and social factors would converge towards a na\u00efve idea of what mental illness should look like, especially through the provision of approximate answers.", "doi": "10.1159/000475676", "title": "Ganser Syndrome.", "journal": ["Frontiers of neurology and neuroscience", "Front Neurol Neurosci"]}
