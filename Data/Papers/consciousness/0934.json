In one instance, the patient became bradycardic and experienced related loss of consciousness, ultimately requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation. In the second case, the patient experienced an episode of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. We explore the various types of arrhythmias that have been reported secondary to central venous catheters, as well as factors that\u00a0place patients at an increased risk for arrhythmia while undergoing PICC insertion. Furthermore, we look at the literature for methods to improve the insertion of PICC lines by decreasing the risk of catheter over-insertion as well as the effects of training for PICC placement.", "doi": "10.7759/cureus.1308", "title": "Cardiac Arrhythmias Resulting from a Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter: Two Cases and a Review of the Literature.", "journal": ["Cureus", "Cureus"]}
