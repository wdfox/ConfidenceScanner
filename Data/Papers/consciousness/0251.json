They were then prospectively followed until 1July 2011 to evaluate their outcome with the GOSE. We compared survival function and outcomes of these two groups.Both survival function and outcomes, including consciousness recovery, were significantly better in the MCS group. This difference of outcome still holds when considering only patients still alive at the end of the study.Early accurate clinical diagnosis of VS/UWS or MCS conveys a strong prognostic value of survival and of consciousness recovery.", "doi": "10.1080/02699052.2017.1364421", "title": "Survival and consciousness recovery are better in the minimally conscious state than in the vegetative state.", "journal": ["Brain injury", "Brain Inj"]}
