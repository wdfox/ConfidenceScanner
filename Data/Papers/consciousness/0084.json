The aim of this study was to identify predictors of outcome and investigate intervention strategies following ICH development in ECMO-treated adult patients.We conducted a retrospective review of adult patients (\u226518 years) who developed an ICH during ECMO treatment at the Karolinska University Hospital (Stockholm, Sweden) between September 2005 and May 2017. Outcome was assessed by 30-day mortality and Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) after 6 months. The statistical analysis was supplemented by a case series of patients who were surgically treated for an ICH.Sixty-five patients developed an ICH during ECMO treatment. 30-day mortality was 74% (n = 48), and was significantly associated with low level of consciousness at ICH diagnosis (p = 0.036), presence of intraparenchymal hematoma (IPH) (p = 0.049), IPH volume (p = 0.002), presence of intraventricular hemorrhage (p = 0.001), subarachnoid hemorrhage Fisher grade (p<0.001), hydrocephalus (p<0.001), midline shift (p = 0.026) and absent basal cisterns (p<0.001). Among the 30-day survivors (n = 17), 63% (n = 10) had favorable neurological outcome (GOS 4-5) after six months. Five patients were surgically treated for their ICH, some with dire hemorrhagic consequences, however one patient made a complete recovery.ICH in adult ECMO patients is associated with a high mortality rate. Outcome predictors can help to identify patients where ICH treatment is indicated. Treating a patient with an ICH during ECMO represents an intricate balance between pro- and anticoagulatory demands. Furthermore, surgical treatment is associated with several risks but may be indicated in life-threatening lesions.
