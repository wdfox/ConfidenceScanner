Students kept journal logs and did a formal presentation for the class. Nursing students reported decreased stress and improved concentration, academic performance, productivity, and problem-solving while experiencing a greater appreciation of their clinical experiences. Using Therapeutic Touch and other subtle energy interactions, the students also cited improved interpersonal relationships, increased feelings of calmness, a higher degree of self-awareness and self-care, reduced physical pain, increased energy, and greater appreciation of the world around them. The theoretical framework was Margret Neuman's theory of health as expanding consciousness. While this is an elective nursing course, the nursing students were primarily juniors and seniors already taking clinical courses. A research study with a wide sample of student participants, especially freshmen, and using quantitative as well as qualitative measures would be beneficial to determine if such a course should be part of the standard nursing curriculum to not only expand nurses' understanding of complementary and alternative therapies but also to help students with their own self-care and influence their practice as clinicians.", "doi": "10.1177/0898010117745436", "title": "Energetic Modalities as a Self-Care Technique to Reduce Stress in Nursing Students.", "journal": ["Journal of holistic nursing : official journal of the American Holistic Nurses' Association", "J Holist Nurs"]}
