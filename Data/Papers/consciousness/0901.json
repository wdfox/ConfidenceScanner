This study was conducted to study the prevalence and clinicodemographic profile of children with seizures in a tertiary care hospital of western Nepal. This prospective cross-sectional study conducted over a period of 2 years included all admitted children (2 months-16 years) with seizures. Among 4962 admitted children, seizures were present in 3.4% (n = 168) of children, with male preponderance. 138 (82.1%) children had generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) and 30 (17.9%) children had partial seizures. GTCS were more common than partial seizures in both sexes (male = 82.7%; female = 81.2%) and age groups. There was no statistical significance in the distribution of seizures (GTCS and partial seizures) with sexes (P = 0.813) and age groups (P = 0.955). Mean ages of children having GTCS and partial seizures were 8.2 \u00b1 4.6 years and 8.2 \u00b1 4.2 years, respectively. Loss of consciousness (55.4%), fever (39.9%), vomiting (35.1%), and headache (16.1%) were common complaints in seizure patients. Significant number of GTCS cases had fever (P = 0.041) and neurocysticercosis (n = 72; 43%) was the most common etiology in seizure patients. Idiopathic epilepsy (38 (22.6%)), meningoencephalitis (26 (15.5%)), and febrile convulsions (14 (8.33%)) were other leading disorders in children with seizures.", "doi": "10.1155/2017/1524548", "title": "Clinicodemographic Profile of Children with Seizures in a Tertiary Care Hospital: A Cross-Sectional Observational Study.", "journal": ["Neurology research international", "Neurol Res Int"]}
