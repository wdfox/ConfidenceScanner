Patients with a history of neurological disease and those included in the derivation cohort were excluded.Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the association between each of the three predictor variables and poor AE outcome (Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category score \u22652). Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was also performed to assess the screening performance of the NSAE-CPR.The ROC analysis identified at least one of the three predictive variables as an optimal cut-off point, with an area under the curve of 0.915 (95% CI 0.825 to 1.000). The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, positive and negative likelihood ratios and Matthews correlation coefficient were 0.867, 0.954, 0.149, 0.999, 18.704, 0.140 and 0.349, respectively.Our findings indicate that the NSAE-CPR can be used for the screening and identification of patients with poor outcomes due to acute encephalopathy within 6 hours of onset.", "doi": "10.1136/bmjopen-2017-016675", "title": "Clinical prediction rule for neurological sequelae due to acute encephalopathy: a medical community-based validation study in Harima, Japan.", "journal": ["BMJ open", "BMJ Open"]}
