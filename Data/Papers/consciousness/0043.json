We present a patient who repeatedly exhibited severe shaking at emergence from general anesthesia. Her nonepileptic myoclonus was mistaken for a refractory seizure and treated with benzodiazepines and intravenous anesthetics. The resulting depressed level of consciousness rendered myoclonus clinically indistinguishable from refractory seizures. Over the course of 6 procedures, we found that levetiracetam, a first-line antiepileptic drug, effectively suppressed her myoclonus. The episodic nature of perioperative anesthesia care presents a challenge for differentiating myoclonus from seizure while balancing the concerns raised by different surgical procedures, rare comorbidities, and the subjective patient experience.", "doi": "10.1213/XAA.0000000000000682", "title": "Not Everything That Shakes Is a Seizure: A Case Report.", "journal": ["A & A case reports", "A A Case Rep"]}
