Although intestinal perforation after treatment with bevacizumab is well known, Fournier's gangrene rarely occurs during chemotherapy. A 73-year-old man with unresectable rectal cancer during chemotherapy involving the mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab regimen had a consciousness disorder and was admitted to our hospital on emergency. Computed tomography scans indicated a necrotizing soft tissue infection with large amounts of pneumoderma throughout the perineum. He was diagnosed as having Fournier's gangrene via perforation of rectal cancer, and urgent operation was performed. After debridement of the skin and soft tissue around the perineum, loop sigmoidostomy was performed. A nice granulated tissue bed over the perineum was formed via daily lavage with sarin. Although the patient was taken back to the operation theater for ileostomy, he could resume chemotherapy involving mFOLFOX6 without bevacizumab 50 days after the initial operation. It is necessary to pay attention to Fournier's gangrene via perforation during chemotherapy with bevacizumab in patients with lower rectal cancer.", "doi": null, "title": "[A Case of Fournier's Gangrene Due to Perforation of Lower Rectal Cancer during Chemotherapy].", "journal": ["Gan to kagaku ryoho.
