The assessment was performed twice. In the clinical assessment the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was used to evaluate the level of consciousness and the Hunt and Hess Scale (H&H) to assess the patient's condition. To assess the final outcome and early functional capacity Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS), Barthel Index (BI), Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and the new Functional Capacity Scale were used.The assessment performed with the FCS was comparable to the assessment conducted with standardized tools such as BI, mRS or GOS. The clinical condition assessed with the GCS (p < 0.001) and H&H (p < 0.001) differentiates the functional condition assessed using the FCS. Statistically significant correlations were found between FCS and BI (r = -0.78), GOS (r = -0.69) and mRS (r = 0.68).The study indicates that the FCS correlates with other scales used in the assessment of patients with intracranial aneurysm, which means that the proposed tool can be applied successfully in practice. However, further randomized multicenter studies are necessary in order to clarify the final conclusion.", "doi": null, "title": "Application of the functional capacity scale in the early assessment of functional efficiency in patients after aneurysm embolization: Preliminary reports.", "journal": ["Advances in clinical and experimental medicine : official organ Wroclaw Medical University", "Adv Clin Exp Med"]}
