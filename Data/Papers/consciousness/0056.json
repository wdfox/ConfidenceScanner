It enables us to understand abnormal movements by their phenomena instead of by their localization. To advance the grasping of movement disorders, we discuss the clinical and pathophysiological features of abnormal movements in catatonia/catalepsy, anti-NMDAR encephalitis, paroxysmal dyskinesias, stiff person/leg syndrome, corticobasal degeneration/syndrome, and hysteria. Particular emphasis is placed on the roles of consciousness/unconsciousness, voluntariness/involuntariness, paroxysmal/sustained aspects, and cortical/subcortical networks.", "doi": "10.11477/mf.1416200921", "title": "[From 'Involuntary Movements' to 'Movement Disorders'].", "journal": ["Brain and nerve = Shinkei kenkyu no shinpo", "Brain Nerve"]}
