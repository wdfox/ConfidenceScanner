Recently, an endoscopic procedure for elderly patients with ASDH was carried out and reported; its safety and effectiveness were emphasized because of minimal invasiveness. We report a young case and discuss its difficulties and tips.A 31-year-old man was found to be in a state of general convulsion. At the time of admission, we observed severe consciousness disturbance, anisocoria, and left hemiparesis. Computed tomography showed a massive subdural hematoma with marked midline shift.Osmotherapy and emergency trepanation improved anisocoria. An endoscopic procedure under local anesthesia was sequentially selected. After surgery, the patient's symptoms clearly improved.Although the standard treatment for ASDH is craniotomy, endoscopic surgery may be useful in some cases.", "doi": "10.1002/ams2.295", "title": "Endoscopic hematoma evacuation for acute subdural hematoma in a young patient: a case report.", "journal": ["Acute medicine & surgery", "Acute Med Surg"]}
