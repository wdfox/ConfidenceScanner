This paper critically explores the extent to which the growing, large-scale group of personal support workers (PSWs) can be viewed as part of a new precariat in terms of their position in the healthcare labour market. Drawing on currently available empirical data, this issue is examined particularly with reference to PSWs in Canada - drawing out some of the implications for government health policy in this sphere.", "doi": null, "title": "Personal Support Workers in Canada: The New Precariat?", "journal": ["Healthcare policy = Politiques de sante", "Healthc Policy"]}
