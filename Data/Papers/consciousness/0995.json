This EEG-based diagnosis was eventually confirmed by the clinical evolution of the patient.This approach illustrates the potential importance of functional brain-imaging data to improve diagnosis of consciousness and of cognitive abilities in critical situations in which the behavioral channel is compromised such as deafferented locked-in syndrome.", "doi": "10.1080/02699052.2017.1327673", "title": "Probing consciousness in a sensory-disconnected paralyzed patient.", "journal": ["Brain injury", "Brain Inj"]}
