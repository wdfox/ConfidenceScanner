Initial laboratory data indicated a high level of inflammatory reaction. Enhanced magnetic resonance imaging revealed a thickening of the right cranial dura mater on T1-weighted images. We presumed the patient was diagnosed as having myeloperoxidase antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (MPO-ANCA)-related hypertrophic pachymeningitis (HP). Acute impaired consciousness without focal signs is an unusual presentation of HP. This treatable disease should be considered as a differential diagnosis when a patient presents with drowsiness and headache.", "doi": "10.1002/jgf2.73", "title": "A case of suspected MPO-ANCA-related hypertrophic pachymeningitis with atypical presentation.", "journal": ["Journal of general and family medicine", "J Gen Fam Med"]}
