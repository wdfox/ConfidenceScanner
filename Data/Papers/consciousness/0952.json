It is associated with a compromise to dura integrity and typically has a delayed post-operative onset. Here, we describe a patient who suffered a CH that presented with a generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizure immediately after a revision lumbar fusion. The patient did not regain\u00a0consciousness from anesthesia prior to the hemorrhage. There are no reports indicating that CHs can occur abruptly following a spine surgery. This case outlines the importance of remaining vigilant for signs of CH immediately after surgery.", "doi": "10.7759/cureus.1292", "title": "Immediate Remote Cerebellar Hemorrhage and Seizure Following Revision Lumbosacral Fusion.", "journal": ["Cureus", "Cureus"]}
