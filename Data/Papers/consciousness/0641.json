After 5 days, he developed an impaired consciousness, headache, and neck stiffness. A sample of the colonic mucosa, blood cultures, and cerebrospinal fluid revealed Listeria monocytogenes infection. Intravenous ampicillin improved the symptoms of fever, bloody diarrhea, and headache without any neurological sequelae. Physicians should consider that Listeria enteritis complicating ulcerative colitis can cause septicemia and meningitis in immunosuppressed patients. A patient's central nervous system can avoid the effects of Listeria meningitis by an early diagnosis and appropriate treatment.", "doi": "10.2169/internalmedicine.8654-16", "title": "Listeria Monocytogenes Septicemia and Meningitis Caused by Listeria Enteritis Complicating Ulcerative Colitis.", "journal": ["Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)", "Intern.
