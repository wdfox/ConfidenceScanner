This allowed for a distinction between history in health and history of health. Precedents of this social role can be found in the fields of feminist and postcolonial histories, oral history and museums in health.Reasons for why historians and health promotion practitioners and researchers have not previously had working relationships were explored, as were some of the factors that would need to be considered for such relationships to work well, including the need to recognise different languages, different understandings of the role of history, and a potential lack of awareness of the health implications of historical work.", "doi": "10.1016/j.puhe.2017.10.028", "title": "History in health: health promotion's underexplored tool for change.", "journal": ["Public health", "Public Health"]}
