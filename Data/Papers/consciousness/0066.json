Although GBM is one of the most aggressive tumors in the brain, propagation through the dura mater is very rare.A 59-year-old man presented with progressive headache and aphasia. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging identified an abnormal mass extending transcranially through the widened foramen rotundum into the infratemporal fossa and cavernous sinus. Emergency surgery was performed because of the patient's disturbed consciousness and uncal herniation. The pathological diagnosis was glioblastoma with isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH-1) wild type arising in the left temporal region of the brain, penetrating the dura mater and propagating to the middle fossa with enlargement of the foramen rotundum. The tumor was resected and radiochemotherapy with temozolomide was administered.Although the mechanism of tumor spread is unknown, we hypothesized that originally there may have been spontaneous dural defects or thinning, such as a meningoencephalocele in the middle fossa, and the tumor coincidentally occurred there.", "doi": "10.1016/j.wneu.2017.12.097", "title": "Transdural propagation of glioblastoma through the foramen rotundum.", "journal": ["World neurosurgery", "World Neurosurg"]}
