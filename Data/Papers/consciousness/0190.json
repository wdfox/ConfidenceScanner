In contrast to other thrombotic microangiopathies, treatment for TA-TMA has yet to be clarified. A 52-year-old male patient with liver cirrhosis due to hepatitis C underwent split liver transplantation from a deceased donor. His clinical course was without complication until 4 days after transplantation, when he experienced impaired consciousness, hemolytic anemia with fragmented erythrocytes, and marked thrombocytopenia. TA-TMA was diagnosed, and recombinant thrombomodulin was administered for 4 days. The patient's clinical symptoms and laboratory data rapidly improved. He has been followed up for 6 months and has not shown any complications. The pathogenesis of TA-TMA is endothelial damage in the vasculature. Recombinant thrombomodulin, an endothelial cell-protecting agent, is a promising new therapeutic choice for TA-TMA after liver transplantation.", "doi": "10.1016/j.transproceed.2017.09.014", "title": "Successful Recombinant Thrombomodulin Treatment for Thrombotic Microangiopathy After Liver Transplantation: A Case Report.", "journal": ["Transplantation proceedings", "Transplant.
