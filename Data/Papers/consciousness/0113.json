Two months later, the tracheostomy tube was removed. One year later, he suffered from severe cicatricial tracheal stenosis. Under a diagnosis of post-intubation tracheal stenosis, he underwent circumferential resection and end-to-end anastomosis of the trachea. The central part of the resected trachea of 3 cartilage rings showed a stenosis like a pin hole. The post operative course was uneventful, and there was no stenosis or sutural insufficiency on examination by bronchoscopy. Tracheal resection and reconstruction is rare but effective for refractory tracheal stenosis.", "doi": "10.7888/juoeh.39.309", "title": "[A Successful Case of Tracheal Segmental Resection and Reconstruction for Cicatricial Tracheal Stenosis].", "journal": ["Journal of UOEH", "J.
