The standard treatment includes maximal safe resection plus adjuvant therapy. Thalamic GBMs, however, are unfavorable for microsurgical removal because of deep location and proximity to critical structures. We present a patient presenting with progressive hemiparesis and decreased consciousness with a large thalamic GBM who underwent subtotal resection through a transsylvian approach. His clinical and neurologic condition improved after surgery and he survived nine months after surgery. This may propose that in selected cases, more aggressive microsurgery for debulking of tumors might have some impact in the final outcome.\u200b\u200b\u200b.", "doi": "10.7759/cureus.1662", "title": "Subtotal Resection of a Thalamic Glioblastoma Multiforme through Transsylvian Approach.", "journal": ["Cureus", "Cureus"]}
