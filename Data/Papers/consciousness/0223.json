In infants, the most common cause of severe hypertriglyceridemia is lipoprotein lipase deficiency. We describe a 7-week-old infant with severe hypertriglyceridemia, who presented with frequent gastrointestinal bleeding, respiratory distress, a decreased level of consciousness and lipemia retinalis. Triglycerides were reduced from 734 to 2 mmol/L (64,956-177 mg/dL), by exchange transfusions. The infant made a remarkable recovery with no sequelae. This case highlights atypical, protean presentations and a potential treatment when established therapies are unavailable.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jacl.2017.10.018", "title": "Exchange transfusions for extreme hypertriglyceridemia in a 7-week-old infant with multi-organ failure.", "journal": ["Journal of clinical lipidology", "J Clin Lipidol"]}
