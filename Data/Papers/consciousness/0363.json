Here, we are reporting a particular methodology of the asphyxial method of suicide in which a case of self-strangulation culminated into partial hanging. A 30-year-old male wrapped one end of the cable wire around his neck. He then passed the other end over a curtain rod and tied that end around the right hand. He pulled the hand down, using the curtain rod as a fulcrum, to tighten the noose around the neck in an attempt to strangulate himself. However, he lost consciousness during the process and the body slipped down, pulling the right hand up which got stuck at the curtain rod. This led the body hanged in the kneeling position. This bizarre scenario raised suspicion of homicide but the crime scene, autopsy and victim characteristics were in favor of suicide.", "doi": "10.1111/1556-4029.13680", "title": "Self-Strangulation Turning into Partial Hanging for a Suicide Victim.", "journal": ["Journal of forensic sciences", "J.
