We performed a systematic review of the literature and included 5 additional cases from our center. Of the 198 cases found, the mean age was 67 years and 87% of patients had renal dysfunction. The most common clinical features were diminished level of consciousness (80%), disorientation/agitation (47%), and myoclonus (40%). It is worth noting that nonconvulsive status epilepticus was relatively common with 31% of cases, whereas only 11% had convulsive seizures. Single-center estimate of incidence was 1 in 480 courses of cefepime. Cefepime neurotoxicity should be considered in older patients with renal dysfunction and new onset encephalopathy, especially if concurrent myoclonus is present. More work is needed to prospectively assess incidence and outcomes related to cefepime neurotoxicity.", "doi": "10.1093/ofid/ofx170", "title": "Characterizing Cefepime Neurotoxicity: A Systematic Review.", "journal": ["Open forum infectious diseases", "Open Forum Infect Dis"]}
