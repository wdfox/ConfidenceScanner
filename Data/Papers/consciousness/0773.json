The patient presented with recent onset of progressive headache, decreased level of consciousness and multiple episodes of vomiting. CT of the head revealed multiple hemorrhagic lesions within the brain. The patient's serum B-human chorionic gonadotrophin was increased. \u00a0A chest X-ray revealed a right lung mass. The patient urgently underwent operative excision of the lesion in the posterior fossa, so as to prevent impending tonsillar herniation. The histology from the lesion provided the diagnosis of choriocarcinoma. After surgery, ultrasonography of the abdomen and pelvis was normal, and a chest CT revealed an enhanced and highly vascular right apical lung lesion, suggestive of lung primary choriocarcinoma, with regard to the clinical background. The patient was then started on chemotherapy, following which her serum B-HCG level decreased rapidly. This case highlights the importance of keeping this entity in the differential diagnosis of hemorrhagic lesions in any patients of a child bearing age. Early diagnosis and rapid initiation of multimodal therapy is prudent for ensuring a good outcome from an otherwise rapidly metastasizing and highly vascular lesion.", "doi": "10.12688/f1000research.11681.1", "title": "Case Report: Multiple hemorrhagic metastases to the brain from primary lung choriocarcinoma.", "journal": ["F1000Research", "F1000Res"]}
