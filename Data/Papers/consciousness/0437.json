The inclusion criteria were full-text journal articles in French, English, Portuguese, or Spanish, exploring the relationship between posture and voice or dysphonia, in adult human beings. The exclusion criteria coupled treatments for voice disorders, literature reviews and meta-analyses, case studies, opinion articles, and studies linking breathing with posture without assessing voice. Studies were analyzed using a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS).Twelve papers met the inclusion criteria with high methodological quality through the NOS. The review shows that a correct posture is necessary for an efficient voice production; however, the relation between dysphonia and posture seems to be contradictory.An effective posture allows a subject in a static posture or while moving to more easily shift the tension between muscles, allowing for a free movement of the larynx without blockages and with benefits to voice production.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jvoice.2017.08.030", "title": "Associations between Posture, Voice, and Dysphonia: A Systematic Review.", "journal": ["Journal of voice : official journal of the Voice Foundation", "J Voice"]}
