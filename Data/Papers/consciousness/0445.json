Because of its rarity, existing evidence is limited to a small case series. A 60-year-old woman underwent staging laparotomy, including pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy, for ovarian cancer. On the 11th day, the patient developed a sudden lumbar pain and loss of consciousness, which resulted in a state of shock. She was diagnosed as having a pelvic abscess and ruptured external iliac artery pseudoaneurysm. We performed ligation of the external iliac artery to restrain hemorrhage and femoro-femoral artery bypass to prevent infection, which saved the patient's life. Our study had two findings. First, this is the first reported case of ruptured external iliac artery pseudoaneurysm following surgery for ovarian cancer. Second, treatment of ruptured pseudoaneurysm requires rapid hemostasis, prevention of infection, and revascularization.", "doi": "10.1111/jog.13475", "title": "Ruptured external iliac artery pseudoaneurysm following surgery for ovarian cancer: A case report and literature review.", "journal": ["The journal of obstetrics and gynaecology research", "J.
