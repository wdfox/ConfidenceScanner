One connection that is missing from contemporary maps is a link to the habenula. This link was reported in the early part of the last century, but appears to have slipped into obscurity. Here, I review the evidence for the existence of this innervation and consider the potential roles it could play. In particular, the possibility that this pathway is involved in non-visual responses to ambient illumination, including emotional responses, is examined.", "doi": "10.1016/j.semcdb.2017.08.023", "title": "The thalamo-habenula projection revisited.", "journal": ["Seminars in cell & developmental biology", "Semin.
