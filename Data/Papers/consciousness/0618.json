AEEGs were divided into early EEG (E-EEG) (first 30 minutes) and extended EEG (remaining 23.5 hours). Extended EEGs were further divided into segments (S): 31st minute to 8th hour (SI), 9th to 16th hours (SII) and 17th to 24th hours (SIII). Each consecutive segment was reviewed to identify new EDs not seen previously.Fifty-seven AEEGs were included, the median age being 36.3 years, the range being 18.7 to 78.6 years. There were 38 (66.6%) females. The collective yield of AEEG for detecting EDs was 19/57 (33.4%). The yield of E-EEG of new EDs was 5/57 (9%). During extended EEG, the distribution of EDs was as follows: SI, 5/57 (9%); SII, 13/55 (24%); and SIII, 1/32 (3%). The yield, however, did not increase beyond the 13th hour. In undiagnosed episodes of loss of consciousness group (11), yield was 0/11 in all segments.(1) There was no value added for yield of EDs by extending the EEG recording beyond 13 hours in epilepsy group. (2) The probability of capturing EDs is negligible if the clinical history does not clearly support the diagnosis of seizure or epilepsy.", "doi": "10.1080/21646821.2017.1353799", "title": "No Further Yield of Ambulatory EEG for Epileptiform Discharges Beyond 13 Hours.", "journal": ["The Neurodiagnostic journal", "Neurodiagn J"]}
