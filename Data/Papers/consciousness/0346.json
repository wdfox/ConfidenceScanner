Scientific evidence, however, is not consistent with these ideas. The adult pineal gland weighs less than 0.2 g, and its principal function is to produce about 30 \u00b5g per day of melatonin, a hormone that regulates circadian rhythm through very high affinity interactions with melatonin receptors. It is clear that very minute concentrations of N,N-dimethyltryptamine have been detected in the brain, but they are not sufficient to produce psychoactive effects. Alternative explanations are presented to explain how stress and near death can produce altered states of consciousness without invoking the intermediacy of N,N-dimethyltryptamine.", "doi": "10.1177/0269881117736919", "title": "N,N-dimethyltryptamine and the pineal gland: Separating fact from myth.", "journal": ["Journal of psychopharmacology (Oxford, England)", "J.
