We then assessed the relationship between rCP and questionnaire-based measures of hypoglycaemia in 256 patients with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes and a comparison group of 209 individuals with type 1 diabetes.Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)-assessed glucose variability and hypoglycaemia was greater in individuals with rCP\u00a0<\u00a0200\u00a0pmol/l despite similar mean glucose. In those with low vs high C-peptide, SD of glucose was 4.2 (95% CI 3.7, 4.6) vs 3.0 (2.6, 3.4) mmol/l (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In the low-C-peptide vs high-C-peptide group, the proportion of individuals experiencing sustained hypoglycaemia \u2264\u00a04\u00a0mmol/l was 94% vs 41% (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), the mean rate of hypoglycaemia was 5.5 (4.4, 6.7) vs 2.1 (1.4, 2.9) episodes per person per week (p\u00a0=\u00a00.004) and the mean duration was 630 (619, 643) vs 223 (216, 230) min per person per week (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). Hypoglycaemia \u2264\u00a03\u00a0mmol/l was infrequent in individuals with preserved C-peptide (1.8 [1.2, 2.6] episodes per person per week vs 0.4 [0.1, 0.8] episodes per person per week for low vs high C-peptide, p\u00a0=\u00a00.04) and only occurred at night. In a population-based cohort with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes, self-reported hypoglycaemia was twice as frequent in those with rCP\u00a0<\u00a0200\u00a0pmol/l (OR 2.0, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and the rate of episodes resulting in loss of consciousness or seizure was five times higher (OR 5.0, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). The relationship between self-reported hypoglycaemia and C-peptide was similar in individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.Low rCP is associated with increased glucose variability and hypoglycaemia in patients with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes and represents a practical, stable and inexpensive biomarker for assessment of hypoglycaemia risk.", "doi": "10.1007/s00125-017-4449-2", "title": "Random non-fasting C-peptide testing can identify patients with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes at high risk of hypoglycaemia.", "journal": ["Diabetologia", "Diabetologia"]}
