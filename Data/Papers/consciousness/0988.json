After removal of the 18-gauge biopsy needle, the patient lost consciousness and developed shock. CT showed signs of air embolism in descending aorta and left atrium. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was unsuccessful. A postmortem CT scan confirmed a massive air embolism in the descending aorta, left ventricle and brain. Systemic air embolism occurs in around 0.001-0.003% of lung biopsy procedures. Recommendations to reduce the risk include requesting the patient to stop breathing during the procedure and preventing the exposure of the outer cannula of a coaxial biopsy needle to the atmosphere.", "doi": "10.1308/rcsann.2017.0091", "title": "Systemic air embolism as a complication of percutaneous computed tomography guided transthoracic lung biopsy.", "journal": ["Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England", "Ann R Coll Surg Engl"]}
