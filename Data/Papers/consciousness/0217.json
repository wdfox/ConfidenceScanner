Both rater A and rater B completed their assessment on day 1, and rater A repeated their assessment on day 2. Inter-rater and test-retest reliability were evaluated with an intra-class correlation coefficient and Spearman rank correlation. Internal consistency was estimated with Cronbach's \u03b1. Agreement in diagnostic impression was determined using Cohen's \u03ba.Inter-rater reliability for CRS-R total scores and test-retest reliability was excellent: (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00.76, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00.92, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), respectively. Inter-rater diagnostic agreement was good (\u03ba\u00a0=\u00a00.72, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Inter-rater reliability for subscales was fair to excellent. Internal consistency was excellent (Cronbach's \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.85).The Polish version of CRS-R can be administered reliably by trained raters and can successfully differentiate between vegetative state (VS), minimally conscious (MCS), and patients emerging from a minimally conscious state (EMCS).", "doi": "10.1080/02699052.2017.1406991", "title": "A validation of the Polish version of the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRSR).", "journal": ["Brain injury", "Brain Inj"]}
