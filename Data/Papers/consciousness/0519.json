There are many factors that affect oral health negatively and nurses have important responsibilities in this regard.The aim of this study was assessment of the intensive care unit patients' oral health and risk factors.This study was planned as a descriptive study and conducted between December 2015 and June 2016, with 202 patients in 20 intensive care units of 6 hospitals in Turkey. Data were collected via Data Collection Form and Bedside Oral Exam guide. Oral health assessment of patients was made using a source of light and a tongue depressor.We observed a significant difference in score of the Bedside Oral Exam guide by age, consciousness, type of respiration and feeding, the frequency of oral health, the total number of drugs, and technique of oral care (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). None of the intensive care units were using the oral assessment guide.The result of this study shows that there are various risk factors that adversely affect the oral health of intensive care unit patients. Nurses should undertake assessments on the basis of oral care protocols for patients at risk and carry out evidence-based individualized oral care applications.", "doi": "10.1111/ijn.12592", "title": "Examination of intensive care unit patients' oral health.", "journal": ["International journal of nursing practice", "Int J Nurs Pract"]}
