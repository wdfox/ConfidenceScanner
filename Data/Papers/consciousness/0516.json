The goals of treatment are prompt recognition, early seizure termination, and simultaneous evaluation for any potentially treatable cause. Improved understanding of the pathophysiology has led to a more practical definition. New data have emerged regarding the safety and efficacy of alternative agents, which are increasingly used in the management of these patients. Continuous electroencephalogram monitoring is more widely used and has revealed a higher incidence of subclinical seizures than was previously thought.", "doi": "10.1016/j.ncl.2017.06.010", "title": "New Developments in Refractory Status Epilepticus.", "journal": ["Neurologic clinics", "Neurol Clin"]}
