In our case, radiofrequency current catheter ablation was accomplished successfully in a 15-year-old girl who had been experiencing supraventricular tachycardia for 6 months. She presented with abrupt onset of left hemiplegia and loss of consciousness on the first postoperative day. An urgent cerebral computed tomography showed a hyperdense right middle cerebral artery. Transthoracic echocardiogram examination revealed an atrial septal defect (ASD), with the diameter measuring 39\u2009mm. The case highly suggests that the issue of ASD should be resolved by either closed or prompt anticoagulant therapy, especially for patients who are planned to receive catheter manipulation.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2017.05.035", "title": "Paradoxical Embolism in a Girl with Atrial Septal Defect After Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia Ablation.", "journal": ["Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association", "J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis"]}
