Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging on day 6 of illness showed diffuse high signals in the bilateral subcortical white matter, while electroencephalogram indicated low-voltage slow waves. This indicated acute encephalopathy with biphasic seizures and late reduced diffusion (AESD); severe neurological sequelae remained. This is the first report of AESD as a complication of KD.", "doi": "10.1111/ped.13431", "title": "Acute encephalopathy with biphasic seizures and late reduced diffusion in Kawasaki disease.", "journal": ["Pediatrics international : official journal of the Japan Pediatric Society", "Pediatr Int"]}
