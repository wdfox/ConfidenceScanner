To date, only one clinical scoring system to predict mortality in a developing world setting has been described. This is the Baragwanath mortality prediction score (\"ABC\": admission blood pressure, brain matter spillage and consciousness level).We performed a retrospective review of prospectively entered data for a cohort of patients with isolated cerebral GSWs over a 5-year period (January 2010-December 2014) in our institution. We aimed to validate the Baragwanath ABC mortality prediction score in our population.During the 5-year study period, 102 patients with isolated cerebral GSWs were reviewed, 22% (22/102) of which died. Based on the total ABC score (1-5), the mortality was 0% for 1, 21% for 2, 67% for 3, 92% for 4, and 100% for 5. The ABC score has a sensitivity\u00a0of 82% (95% CI 60-95%), specificity\u00a0of 96% (95% CI 89-99%), PPV\u00a0of 86% (95% CI 66-96%) and NPV\u00a0of 95% (95% CI 86-99%).The Baragwanath mortality prediction\u00a0score accurately predicts non survival of patients with a cerebral GSW\u00a0in our patient cohort. Further validation studies in other populations are required before this system can be widely adopted.", "doi": "10.1007/s00068-017-0835-1", "title": "Validation of the Baragwanath mortality prediction score for cerebral gunshot wounds: the Pietermaritzburg experience.", "journal": ["European journal of trauma and emergency surgery : official publication of the European Trauma Society", "Eur J Trauma Emerg Surg"]}
