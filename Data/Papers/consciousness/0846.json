Although the present analysis largely agrees with their proposal, it argues that a Dual Model of time (see Montemayor's 2013 monograph, Minding Time: A Philosophical and Theoretical Approach to the Psychology of Time) is needed to account for two important roles in time cognition, one related to navigation and the other to conscious awareness. In a Dual Model, the homeostatic principle plays a critical role with respect to conscious awareness, but a different principle is needed for integrating the metric constraints on navigation.", "doi": "10.1002/pchj.173", "title": "Conscious awareness and time perception.", "journal": ["PsyCh journal", "Psych J"]}
