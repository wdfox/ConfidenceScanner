This study aims to evaluate self-esteem among adolescents who undergo chemical peelings.One hundred and twenty six patients constituted the study group. Sixty seven individuals had undergone chemical peeling for therapeutic reasons and 59 individuals for cosmetic reasons. To assess patients' self-esteem, the Rosenberg's Self-esteem Scale (RSES) was used before and after treatment. The control group included 71 healthy, age- and sex-matched volunteers from the general population. They were also asked to complete the RSES, after the same time interval as the patients.The healthy controls (23.01\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.12) presented statistically significantly higher self-esteem than both the groups of individuals who would be submitted to chemical peeling. Furthermore, patients who would undergo peeling for therapeutic reasons (21.58\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.20) had statistically significantly higher self-esteem than those who would undergo the procedure for cosmetic reasons (18.97\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.36). After the chemical peeling sessions, the self-esteem of patients treated for therapeutic reasons (23.48\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.43) and of patients treated for cosmetic reasons (22.83\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.34) improved statistically significantly, while the self-esteem of the healthy controls remained stable, as expected.Patients who undergo chemical peelings tend to have low levels of self-esteem. Although facial lesions in skin diseases such as acne, acne scars, rosacea, and melasma seem to have negative effect on individuals' self-consciousness, patients who would be submitted to chemical peeling in order to treat wrinkles, loss of radiance, and skin tone clarity have even lower self-esteem. Chemical peelings were shown to favorably affect patient's self-esteem since all patients showed an increase in self-esteem after treatment, while the control group experienced no change.", "doi": "10.1080/14764172.2017.1400168", "title": "Patients' self-esteem before and after chemical peeling procedure.", "journal": ["Journal of cosmetic and laser therapy : official publication of the European Society for Laser Dermatology", "J Cosmet Laser Ther"]}
