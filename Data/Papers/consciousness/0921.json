In all cases, magnetic resonance imaging showed that combination therapy decreased tumor volume and peritumoral edema volume. The therapy was successfully administered to 3 patients without decreasing their KPS. However, 1 patient with seeding lesions dropped out of therapy because of deteriorating consciousness and decreasing KPS.Subgroup analysis in a randomized control study(AVAglio)showed that patients with a PS score of 1-2(corresponding to a KPS score of 60-80)tended to have prolonged survival after Bev treatment compared with those with a PS score of 0(corresponding to a KPS score of 90-100). In the present study, radiochemotherapy with Bev decreased lesion and edema volumes in all patients, and led to maintained or improved KPS in 3 patients. These results suggest that the treatment is potentially effective for patients with newly diagnosed GBM and lower KPS.", "doi": null, "title": "[Combination Therapy with Radiation, Temozolomide, and Bevacizumab after Partial Tumor Removal in Glioblastoma Patients with Low Performance Status].", "journal": ["Gan to kagaku ryoho.
