The most common causes of previously reported reversible focal lesions of the CCS are viral encephalitis, antiepileptic drug toxicity/withdrawal, and metabolic disorders. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy is used for different immune-mediated diseases. It is generally safe, and serious adverse reactions are uncommon. We presented a rare case of disturbed consciousness with reversible CCS lesions after IVIG therapy for Guillain-Barre syndrome in an adult woman. In this case, we believe that IVIG therapy caused reversible CCS lesions with encephalopathy and probably result of cytotoxic edema and/or cerebral arterial vasospasm.", "doi": "10.1097/WNF.0000000000000236", "title": "Reversible Splenial Lesion Syndrome After Intravenous Immunoglobulin Treatment for Guillain-Barre Syndrome.", "journal": ["Clinical neuropharmacology", "Clin Neuropharmacol"]}
