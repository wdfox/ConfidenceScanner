The authors' aim was to find associations between candidate genes and subjective dimensions of hypnosis; 136 subjects participated in hypnosis and noninvasive DNA sampling. The phenomenological dimensions were tapped by the Archaic Involvement Measure (AIM), the Phenomenology of Consciousness Inventory (PCI), and the Dyadic Interactional Harmony Questionnaire (DIH). The main results were that the \"Need of dependence\" subscale of AIM was associated with the COMT genotypes. The GG subgroup showed higher scores, whereas AA had below average scores on the majority of the subjective measures. An association between the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism and the intimacy scores on the DIH was also evident. The effects are discussed in the social-psychobiological model of hypnosis.", "doi": "10.1080/00207144.2017.1348848", "title": "Dopaminergic and Serotonergic Genotypes and the Subjective Experiences of Hypnosis.", "journal": ["The International journal of clinical and experimental hypnosis", "Int J Clin Exp Hypn"]}
