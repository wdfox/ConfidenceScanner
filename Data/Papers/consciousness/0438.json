In touch with these concepts, originally developed by the far-flung branch of high energy physics, here we evaluate the role of collective behaviors and long-range functional couplingsof charged particlesin brain dynamics. We build a novel, empirically testable, brain model which takes into account collisionless movements of charged particles in a system, the brain, equipped with oscillations. The model is cast in a mathematical fashion with the potential of being operationalized, because it can be assessed in terms of McKean-Vlasov equations, derived from the classical Vlasov equations for plasma. A plasma-like brain also elucidates cortical phase transitions in the context of a brain at the edge of chaos, describing the required order parameters. In sum, showing how the brain might exhibit plasma-like features,we go through the concept of holistic behavior of nervous functions.", "doi": "10.1016/j.neulet.2017.10.016", "title": "Towards plasma-like collisionless trajectories in the brain.", "journal": ["Neuroscience letters", "Neurosci.
