She was diagnosed with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma accompanied by leukocytosis without infection. Her serum concentration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was highly elevated. Forty-five days after initiating chemotherapy, she was readmitted because of a neuropsychiatric disturbance and hypercalcemia. Her serum concentration of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTH-rP) was elevated. A pretreatment biopsy specimen showed strong cytoplasmic immunoreactivity to anti-PTH-rP antibody, suggesting that overproduction of PTH-rP accounted for the hypercalcemia. Although the patient regained consciousness after treatment, she died of progressive disease 60 days after chemotherapy.", "doi": "10.1155/2017/5656130", "title": "Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Producing Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein.", "journal": ["Case reports in oncological medicine", "Case Rep Oncol Med"]}
