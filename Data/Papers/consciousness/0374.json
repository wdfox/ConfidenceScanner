However, since the early 20th century, there have been reports, many of which controversial, of phenomenal awareness in patients with V1 lesions. These reports include selective sparing of motion awareness, hemianopic completion and visual aftereffects. More recently, there have been successful attempts of inducing visual qualia with noninvasive brain stimulation. Here we critically review this evidence and discuss their implications to theoretical understanding of phenomenal awareness.", "doi": "10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2017.10.029", "title": "On the \"blindness\" of blindsight: What is the evidence for phenomenal awareness in the absence of primary visual cortex (V1)?", "journal": ["Neuropsychologia", "Neuropsychologia"]}
