Even less is known about the reliability of self-reported medical history information in older individuals with cognitive impairment. To this end, we assessed the test-retest reliability of self-reported TBI history in a large, national sample.Participants (n\u00a0=\u00a04309) were older adults with intact cognition, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center. Subjects provided TBI history information at baseline and one annual follow-up visit. Consistency of self-reported history of TBI with\u00a0<5\u00a0minutes loss of consciousness (mLOC) and TBI with\u00a0\u22655 mLOC reported at time 1 and 2 was analyzed across diagnostic groups.Overall, subjects provided reports of TBI history at follow-up that were highly consistent with baseline reports (97.8-99.6% agreement), and Cohen's kappa coefficients were all larger than .80 and statistically significant, maximum p\u00a0<\u00a0.001. Furthermore, level of cognitive impairment was not a significant predictor of consistency in reporting.These data are some of the first to suggest that self-report may be a consistent method of obtaining remote TBI history in the absence of medical records for older individuals, regardless of cognitive impairment.", "doi": "10.1080/13854046.2017.1378371", "title": "Consistency of traumatic brain injury reporting in older adults with and without cognitive impairment.", "journal": ["The Clinical neuropsychologist", "Clin Neuropsychol"]}
