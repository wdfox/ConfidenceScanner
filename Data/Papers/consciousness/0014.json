The second case of KS induced by diclofenac potassium (DP) is presented in this report. A 67-year-old man was brought to our emergency department with the possible diagnosis of anaphylactic shock by the ambulance staff. It emerged that widespread erythema and pruritus developed after taking DP. Then, he lost consciousness. Diffuse urticarial lesions were detected on physical examination at the emergency department. He complained of chest pain during his observation, and progressive ST segment elevation was seen in the inferior leads on serial electrocardiograms. His coronary angiography showed 100% occlusion of the right coronary artery.\u00a0 Then, KS was diagnosed. The patient was discharged on the second day, and he was doing well on the control visit 2 weeks later. All allergic reactions may trigger an ACS so physicians should be aware of KS and always keep that unique clinical entity in mind to recognize it promptly and direct the therapy at suppressing the allergic reaction and improving the coronary circulation simultaneously when encountering a patient with symptoms suggesting an allergic reaction and a concomitant ACS.", "doi": null, "title": "Kounis Syndrome Induced by Oral Intake of Diclofenac Potassium.", "journal": ["Iranian journal of allergy, asthma, and immunology", "Iran J Allergy Asthma Immunol"]}
