A newly acquired dexmedetomidine dataset was compared with our previously published propofol and N3 sleep datasets.In all three unresponsive states (dexmedetomidine sedation, propofol sedation, and N3 sleep), within-network functional connectivity, including thalamic functional connectivity in the higher-order (default mode, executive control, and salience) networks, was significantly reduced as compared with the wake state. Thalamic functional connectivity was not reduced for unresponsive states within lower-order (auditory, sensorimotor, and visual) networks. Voxel-wise statistical comparisons between the different unresponsive states revealed that thalamic functional connectivity with the medial prefrontal/anterior cingulate cortex and with the mesopontine area was reduced least during dexmedetomidine-induced unresponsiveness and most during propofol-induced unresponsiveness. The reduction seen during N3 sleep was intermediate between those of dexmedetomidine and propofol.Thalamic connectivity with key nodes of arousal and saliency detection networks was relatively preserved during N3 sleep and dexmedetomidine-induced unresponsiveness as compared to propofol. These network effects may explain the rapid recovery of oriented responsiveness to external stimulation seen under dexmedetomidine sedation.Committee number: 'Comit\u00e9 d'Ethique Hospitalo-Facultaire Universitaire de Li\u00e8ge' (707); EudraCT number: 2012-003562-40; internal reference: 20121/135; accepted on August 31, 2012; Chair: Prof G.
