Interns were given 10 minutes to independently review a mock chart and list all hazards they identified in the simulation. Interns completed a short survey on their prior training in medical school and a follow-up survey one month into internship. \ud835\udc61 tests used to compare identification of low-value vs safety hazards and to associate performance with prior training.The mean percentage of hazards correctly identified was 50.4% (standard deviation [SD] 11.8%). Interns identified significantly fewer low-value hazards (mean 19.2%, SD 18.6%) than safety hazards (mean 66.0%, SD 16.0%; \ud835\udc43 < .001). For example, while 96% of interns identified the hand hygiene hazard, only 6% identified the unnecessary blood transfusion and none identified the unnecessary stress ulcer prophylaxis. Interns who self-reported as confident in their ability to identify hazards were not any more likely to correctly identify hazards than those who were not confident.The \"Room of Horrors\" simulation revealed poor awareness of low-value care among interns.
