To study events on this time scale we used direct electrical recordings from the human cerebral cortex during a conscious visual perception task. Faces were presented at individually titrated visual threshold for 9 subjects while measuring broadband 40-115 Hz gamma power in a total of 1621 intracranial electrodes widely distributed in both hemispheres. Surface maps and k-means clustering analysis showed initial activation of visual cortex for both perceived and non-perceived stimuli. However, only stimuli reported as perceived then elicited a forward-sweeping wave of activity throughout the cerebral cortex accompanied by large-scale network switching. Specifically, a monophasic wave of broadband gamma activation moves through bilateral association cortex at a rate of approximately 150 mm/s and eventually reenters visual cortex for perceived but not for non-perceived stimuli. Meanwhile, the default mode network and the initial visual cortex and higher association cortex networks are switched off for the duration of conscious stimulus processing. Based on these findings, we propose a new \"switch-and-wave\" model for the processing of consciously perceived stimuli. These findings are important for understanding normal conscious perception and may also shed light on its vulnerability to disruption by brain disorders.", "doi": "10.1093/cercor/bhx327", "title": "A Switch and Wave of Neuronal Activity in the Cerebral Cortex During the First Second of Conscious Perception.", "journal": ["Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)", "Cereb.
