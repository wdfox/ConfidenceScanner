We describe a patient with no previous psychiatric history who was admitted for hypertensive crisis. A few days after admission, his blood pressure remained uncontrolled and he started to exhibit episodes of confusion, agitation, and psychosis. During one particular episode, he overcame multiple staff members and physical restraints to bite off two of his fingers without any signs of pain. Brain computed tomography (CT) was notable for possible posterior cerebral and cerebellar edema. His confusion and agitation gradually resolved with successful blood pressure management. This is the first reported case of extreme, agitated behaviors and auditory hallucinations in a patient with hypertensive crisis.", "doi": "10.7759/cureus.1334", "title": "Hypertensive Encephalopathy: A Case of a Male Who Bit Off His Fingers.", "journal": ["Cureus", "Cureus"]}
