She received medication with an anxiolytic, an antidepressant, and a\u00a0neuroleptic drug. After a\u00a0normal resting ECG, there were 112\u00a0episodes of paroxysmal atrioventricular block\u00a0III\u00b0 in her 24\u2009h Holter recording with asystole for up to 27\u2009s. The patient was symptomatic only once with dizziness due to an asystole of 8.8\u2009s while she was awake in the early morning. After DDDR pacemaker implantation, the patient was asymptomatic during the following 2\u00a0years. This case illustrates the complex and not fully understood problem of paroxysmal AV block, in this instance neither intrinsic, nor phase\u00a04 or vagally induced. It further reminds us to carefully clarify the cause of loss of consciousness consistently which may render prolonged ECG monitoring necessary also in patients without heart disease.", "doi": "10.1007/s00399-017-0528-9", "title": "Perservative paroxysmal atrioventricular block : Cardiac syncope misdiagnosed as anxiety for more than 20\u00a0years.", "journal": ["Herzschrittmachertherapie & Elektrophysiologie", "Herzschrittmacherther Elektrophysiol"]}
