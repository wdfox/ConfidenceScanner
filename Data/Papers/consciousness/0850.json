Detailed mental and physical health structured interviews, neuropsychological testing, and multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed on 283 participants. Two TBI participant groups were defined for primary analyses: those with a self-reported history of TBI and those with MRI confirmation of TBI. By self-report, 174 participants (61.5%) reported a previous serious head or face injury (symptomatic or asymptomatic), with 100 (35.3%) experiencing symptoms consistent with TBI (any post-injury loss of consciousness, confusion, or memory loss). Persons self-reporting TBI had poorer current mental and physical health, more ongoing neurological symptoms, and a higher rate of mood disorders, compared to those with no TBI. The presence of a mood disorder, a TBI history, and an interaction between these factors contributed to lower mental health. There was evidence of TBI in 20 participants (6.9%) on clinical MRI sequences. These participants had globally lower cortical gray matter volumes and lower white matter fractional anisotropy (FA) values. Neurocognitive test scores positively correlated with both FA and cortical gray matter volumes in participants with MRI evidence of trauma. Previous TBI is associated with poorer mental and physical health in homeless and vulnerably housed individuals and interacts with mood disorders to exacerbate poor mental health. Focal traumatic lesions evident on MRI are associated with diffusely lower gray matter volumes and white matter integrity, which predict cognitive functioning.", "doi": "10.1089/neu.2017.5076", "title": "Traumatic Brain Injury in a Community-Based Cohort of Homeless and Vulnerably Housed Individuals.", "journal": ["Journal of neurotrauma", "J.
