Blood samples were collected before and after two HUT sessions separated by 1 hour and saline was administered in between.Patients' ability to stand upright did not change after saline administration due to OH. The patients showed signs of reduced cerebral autoregulation at both HUT sessions. The patients had a significant lower level of renin and angiotensin II but not aldosterone.Patients with severe ABI and OH demonstrate no improvement in standing time with reduced plasma renin and angiotensin II after two HUT sessions and 1 hour fluid administration. Research focusing on the ability to retain fluid after bed rest is warranted.", "doi": "10.1080/02699052.2017.1408144", "title": "Intravenous saline administration in patients with severe acquired brain injury and orthostatic intolerance for tilt-table mobilization.", "journal": ["Brain injury", "Brain Inj"]}
