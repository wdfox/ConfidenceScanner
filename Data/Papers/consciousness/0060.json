The introduction of air into the venous or the arterial system can cause cerebral air embolism leading to severe neurological deficits. The common causes reported in the literature are iatrogenic; it can be caused by positive pressure maneuvers performed during cardiac resuscitation, lung biopsy, and the placement of venous catheters in the presence of a patent foramen ovale. We report a case of cerebral air embolism which has occurred secondary to lung laceration. The patient underwent intercostal drainage for hydro-pneumothorax and developed forceful cough and suddenly changed in consciousness. Air embolism was diagnosed by computed tomography brain and was managed by high-concentration oxygen therapy and other supportive measures and is being discharged in satisfactory condition.", "doi": "10.4103/ijccm.IJCCM_291_17", "title": "Cerebral Air Embolism Secondary to Lung Laceration.", "journal": ["Indian journal of critical care medicine : peer-reviewed, official publication of Indian Society of Critical Care Medicine", "Indian J Crit Care Med"]}
