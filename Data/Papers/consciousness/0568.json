{"authors": [["Cowling", "W Richard", "WR", "1 Nursing Education Consultant."]], "date": null, "id": "28934035", "text": "The discord within nursing regarding the definition of nursing science has created great angst, particularly for those who view nursing science as a body of knowledge derived from theories specific to its unique concerns. The purpose of this brief article is to suggest a perspective and process grounded in appreciation of wholeness that may offer a way forward for proponents of a unitary-transformative nursing science that transcends the discord. This way forward is guided by principles of fostering dissent without contempt, generating a well-imagined future, and garnering appreciatively inspired action for change.", "doi": "10.1177/0894318417724468", "title": "A Unitary-Transformative Nursing Science: From Angst to Appreciation.", "journal": ["Nursing science quarterly", "Nurs Sci Q"]}
