Hereby we present the short and long-term results of this combined surgical-anesthesiological technique.Between 2005 and 2015, 71 patients (37 men and 34 women) with pulmonary oligometastases, at the first episode, underwent uniportal VATS metastasectomy under non-intubated anesthesia.Four patients (5.6%) required intubation for intolerance. Mean number of lesions resected per patient was 1.51. There was no mortality. The study group demonstrated a significant reduction of operative time from the beginning of the experience (P=0.001), good level of consciousness at Richmond scale and quality of recovery after both 24 and 48 hours. Median hospital stay was 3 days and major morbidity rate was 5.5%. Both disease-free survival and overall survival were similar to those achieved with intubated surgery.VATS lung metastasectomy in non-intubated local anesthesia was safely performed in selected patients with oligometastases with significant advantages in overall operative time, hospital stay and economical costs. Long-term results were similar.", "doi": "10.21037/jovs.2017.07.12", "title": "Uniportal non-intubated lung metastasectomy.", "journal": ["Journal of visualized surgery", "J Vis Surg"]}
