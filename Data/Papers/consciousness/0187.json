However, several complications including intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and acute subdural hematoma are rare after evacuation of a CSDH. A 77-year-old man was admitted with right hemiparesis and dysarthria. A brain computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a bilateral CSDH with midline shifting toward the right side. The patient got the burr hole trephination with the catheters insertion in the both sides of parietal area under the local anesthesia. After burr hole surgery immediately, he developed left side weakness and decreased level of consciousness. Repeat CT scans detected a diffuse SAH and multiple small ICHs. He was treated conservatively and fully recovered at discharge after 1 month. To avoid these complications, slow and gradual drainage of the CSDH is needed. The authors report a rare case of SAH and multipunctate ICHs in both cerebral hemispheres after evacuation of a bilateral CSDH.", "doi": "10.13004/kjnt.2017.13.2.149", "title": "Postoperative Subarachnoid Hemorrhage and Multipunctate Intracerebral Hemorrhages Following Evacuation of Bilateral Chronic Subdural Hematomas.", "journal": ["Korean journal of neurotrauma", "Korean J Neurotrauma"]}
