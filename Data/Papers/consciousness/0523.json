The classical view of this syndrome asserts that conscious unity is abolished. The left hemisphere consciously experiences and functions independently of the right hemisphere. This view is a cornerstone of current consciousness research. In this review, we first discuss the evidence for the classical view. We then propose an alternative, the 'conscious unity, split perception' model. This model asserts that a split brain produces one conscious agent who experiences two parallel, unintegrated streams of information. In addition to changing our view of the split-brain phenomenon, this new model also poses a serious challenge for current dominant theories of consciousness.", "doi": "10.1016/j.tics.2017.09.003", "title": "The Split-Brain Phenomenon Revisited: A Single Conscious Agent with Split Perception.", "journal": ["Trends in cognitive sciences", "Trends Cogn.
