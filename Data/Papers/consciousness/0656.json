People with an older onset of epilepsy had a higher probability of seizure recurrence (1.01; 95%\u2009CI 1.00, 1.02) as did those who had used more antiepileptic drugs (1.05; 95%\u2009CI 1.01 to 1.09). Combinations of variables associated with seizure recurrence gave overall low probabilities of 5-year seizure freedom (eg, a normal MRI and convulsive seizures in the previous year has a probability of seizure freedom at 5\u2009years of approximately 0.19).Readily identified clinical features and investigations are associated with reduced probability of good outcome and need consideration when planning presurgical evaluation.", "doi": "10.1136/jnnp-2017-316211", "title": "Factors affecting seizure outcome after epilepsy surgery: an observational series.", "journal": ["Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry", "J.
