Under the above-mentioned conditions, venous sinus thrombosis is more likely to occur. A patient suffering bilateral acetabular fractures together with the gradual disturbance of consciousness was admitted to our hospital. Though computed tomography arteriogram (CTA) of the brain displayed normal blood vessels; bilateral thalamus and brainstem infarction were found on head computed tomography (CT) and Galen vein thrombosis on cerebral computed tomography venography (CTV). Dehydration and tracheotomy were immediately conducted with antiplatelet, anticoagulant and neurotrophic medicine administered to the patient. After three days' treatment, the patient's consciousness gradually improved and eventually became clear enough to leave the hospital. On follow-up, no dysfunction was documented.", "doi": "10.1016/j.cjtee.2017.05.001", "title": "A case of Galen vein thrombosis occurring after bilateral acetabular fractures in the Tibet plateau - what can we learn?", "journal": ["Chinese journal of traumatology = Zhonghua chuang shang za zhi", "Chin.
