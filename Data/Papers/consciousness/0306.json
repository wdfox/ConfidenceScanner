The neocortex is organized into six distinct laminae, each composed of a rich diversity of cell types which assemble into highly complex cortical circuits. Radial glia progenitors (RGPs) are responsible for producing all neocortical neurons and certain glia lineages. Here, we discuss recent discoveries emerging from clonal lineage analysis at the single RGP cell level that provide us with an inaugural quantitative framework of RGP lineage progression. We further discuss the importance of the relative contribution of intrinsic gene functions and non-cell-autonomous or community effects in regulating RGP proliferation behavior and lineage progression.", "doi": "10.1002/1873-3468.12906", "title": "Mechanisms of radial glia progenitor cell lineage progression.", "journal": ["FEBS letters", "FEBS Lett."]}
