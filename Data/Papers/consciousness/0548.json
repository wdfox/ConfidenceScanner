Her plasma glucose level was 27 mg/dL, and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) revealed postprandial asymptomatic hypoglycemia. A hypervascular tumor was identified via computed tomography in the distal pancreas, and the diagnosis of insulinoma was confirmed using the selective arterial calcium stimulation test. Although no episodes of hypoglycemia were observed during CGM after resection, a pathological examination identified regional lymph node metastasis. It is important to consider insulinoma as a cause of postprandial hypoglycemia, and CGM is useful for evaluating treatment outcomes.", "doi": "10.2169/internalmedicine.8766-16", "title": "Insulinoma Presenting with Reactive Hypoglycemia: Evaluating the Effect of Tumor Resection via Continuous Glucose Monitoring.", "journal": ["Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)", "Intern.
