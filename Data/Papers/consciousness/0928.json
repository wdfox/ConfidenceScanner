The identified factors were applied to the group of patients who were selected for DHC but either refused surgery and died or stabilized and did not undergo DHC.There were 137 patients who underwent DHC. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed middle cerebral artery (MCA) with additional infarcts (odds ratio [OR], 7.9: 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.4-26; P\u2009=\u2009.001), preoperative midline shift of septum pellucidum\u2009of 1\u2009cm or more (OR, 3.83: 95% CI, 1.13-12.96; P\u2009=\u2009.031), and patients who remained unconscious on day 7 postoperatively (8.82: 95% CI; OR, 1.08-71.9; P\u2009=\u2009.042) were significant independent predictors for in-hospital mortality. The identified factors were applied to the group of MMCA patients not operated (n\u2009=\u200919 refused, n\u2009=\u200947 stabilized) single (P\u2009<\u2009.001), and two predictive factors (P\u2009<\u2009.001) were significantly more common in patients who died. Whereas two predicative factors were identified in only 9%-18.2% of survivors, the presence of all three predictive factors was seen only in patients who expired (P\u2009<\u2009.001). The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit statistics (chi-square\u2009=\u20094.65; P value\u2009=\u2009.589) indicate that the model adequately describes the data.Direct physical factors, such as MCA with additional territory infarct, extent of midline shift, and postoperative consciousness level, bore a significant relationship to in-hospital mortality in MMCA patients undergoing DHC.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2017.06.021", "title": "Predictors of In-Hospital Mortality after Decompressive Hemicraniectomy for Malignant Ischemic Stroke.", "journal": ["Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association", "J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis"]}
