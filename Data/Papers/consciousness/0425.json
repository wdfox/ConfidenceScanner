Emergent surgical repair is the gold standard treatment, but some patients cannot tolerate the open surgery. Here, we report an 82-year-old patient with a history of cerebral infarction and cerebral bleeding who presented with a depressed level of consciousness and who was in a state of shock. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed cardiac tamponade associated with retrograde type A aortic dissection(RAAD), with a primary entry tear at a distal site of the left subclavian artery. We therefore performed emergent primary entry closure with stent grafting using the Conformable Gore Tag device and emergent drainage of the cardiac tamponade with subxiphoid pericardiotomy. Postoperative CT scan showed complete closure of the primary entry tear and a completely thrombosed false lumen. Primary entry closure with stent grafting could be an effective option for RAAD that meets anatomical criteria.", "doi": null, "title": "[Emergent Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Repair and Subxiphoid Pericardiotomy for Retrograde Type A Acute Aortic Dissection with Cardiac Tamponade;Report of a Case].", "journal": ["Kyobu geka.
