The patient was initially witnessed to have isolated paroxysmal events consistent with epileptic seizures (altered consciousness, lateral recumbency, tonic/clonic movement of limbs) lasting less than 3 min with an immediate return to normal consciousness. The seizure frequency increased to >3 seizures within 24 hr and phenobarbital 3 mg/kg orally every 12 hr was started. Because of continued epileptic seizures and low serum phenobarbital levels, the dose was increased until significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were detected. Levetiracetam 40 mg/kg orally every 12 hr was initiated and the phenobarbital was weaned and discontinued. One breakthrough seizure has been witnessed in the 10 mo since starting levetiracetam.", "doi": "10.1638/2016-0282.1", "title": "MANAGEMENT OF A REEVE'S MUNTJAC ( MUNTIACUS REEVESI) WITH SEIZURES USING LEVETIRACETAM.", "journal": ["Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians", "J.
