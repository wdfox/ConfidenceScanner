A neurological examination showed that he was in a semi-comatose state and exhibited neck stiffness. Brain magnetic resonance imaging detected high-intensity areas in the bilateral hippocampi and periventricular white matter. A cerebrospinal fluid examination revealed mononuclear pleocytosis, an elevated protein level, and positivity for human herpesvirus-7 (HHV-7) DNA. The patient's condition improved after the administration of methylprednisolone, intravenous immunoglobulins, and acyclovir. This is the first known case of limbic encephalitis associated with HHV-7 in an immunocompetent Japanese adult.", "doi": "10.2169/internalmedicine.56.8185", "title": "Limbic Encephalitis Associated with Human Herpesvirus-7 (HHV-7) in an Immunocompetent Adult: The First Reported Case in Japan.", "journal": ["Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)", "Intern.
