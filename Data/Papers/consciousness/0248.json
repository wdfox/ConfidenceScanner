Herein, we described a case of a 55-year-old man who presented with acute pseudobulbar palsy and mild tetraparesis, but preserved eye movements, with no consciousness disturbance. DWI revealed an acute infarction involving the central portion of the cerebral peduncle with a characteristic \"traditional Chinese eight character\" sign. The relationship between the infarcted range in the cerebral peduncle and the clinical manifestation was discussed in our report.", "doi": "10.1155/2017/9845917", "title": "A Case Report of Isolated Bilateral Cerebral Peduncular Infarction.", "journal": ["Case reports in neurological medicine", "Case Rep Neurol Med"]}
