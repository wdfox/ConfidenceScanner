Abdominal computed tomography revealed a large liver abscess with which the presence of Desulfovibrio desulfuricans and Escherichia coli was confirmed by thorough blood and abscess content culture. Empiric meropenem treatment was switched to cefoperazone/sulbactam, followed by ampicillin/sulbactam based on susceptibility testing. Desulfovibrio desulfuricans is a common bacterium that rarely causes liver abscess and may be overlooked during co-infection due to overgrowth of the accompanying bacteria. Clinicians should bear Desulfovibrio desulfuricans in mind and select the appropriate antibiotics according to susceptibility testing when anaerobic bacteria are detected in a liver abscess.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jiac.2017.11.006", "title": "A case of liver abscess co-infected with Desulfovibrio desulfuricans and Escherichia coli and review of the literature.", "journal": ["Journal of infection and chemotherapy : official journal of the Japan Society of Chemotherapy", "J.
