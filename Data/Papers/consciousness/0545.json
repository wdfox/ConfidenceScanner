A 42-year-old woman presented with a progressive disturbance in consciousness, and diagnosed CVST in the straight sinus (SS). Recanalization of SS was achieved by emergent thrombectomy using aspiration catheter and stent-retriever system, and her level of consciousness improved immediately. The combined use of them aided the removal of the thrombus located in the SS.", "doi": "10.1177/1591019917730335", "title": "Combined use of stent-retriever and aspiration thrombectomy for cerebral venous sinus thrombosis involving the straight sinus: A case report.", "journal": ["Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences", "Interv Neuroradiol"]}
