Each patient in group A was administered with a bolus dose of dexmedetomidine (1.0 \u03bcg\u00b7kg\u207b\u00b9, saline diluted to 10 mL) pump-infused after intubation and a maintenance dose of 0.1-0.4 mL\u00b7(kg\u00b7h)\u207b\u00b9 followed-up until 45 min before the end of operation. Each patient in group B was administered with a bolus dose of normal saline 10 mL pump-infused after intubation and maintenance dose of 0.1-0.4 mL\u00b7(kg\u00b7h)\u207b\u00b9 followed-up until 45 min before the end of operation. Gender, age, weight, physical status according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists, perioperative heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), pulse oxygen saturation (SpO\u2082), sufentanil dosage, duration of surgery, time of extubation, time of regaining consciousness, and time to reach modified Aldrete's score\u226512 were recorded. Behavior in postanesthesia care unit was rated on the four-point agitation scale.Compared with group B, decreases were observed in HR and MAP at the beginning of operation, in 10 and 30 min, 1 and 2 h after the beginning of operation, and after extubation of group A (P<0.05). Sufentanil dosage and incidence of EA during recovery of group A were also lower than those of group B (P<0.05). Time to regain consciousness and time to reach modified Aldrete's score\u226512 of group A were longer than those of group B (P<0.05). No statistical difference was observed between other indexes of the two groups.As an anesthetic used for general anesthesia maintenance in children undergoing odontotherapy in day-surgery operating room, dexmedetomidine results in low incidence of EA during recovery and more stable vital signs.\u76ee\u7684 \u5c06\u53f3\u7f8e\u6258\u54aa\u5b9a\u7528\u4e8e\u513f\u7ae5\u7259\u79d1\u65e5\u95f4\u5168\u9ebb\u624b\u672f\u7684\u7ef4\u6301\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u5bf9\u82cf\u9192\u671f\u8e81\u52a8\u53d1\u751f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5 \u5c06\u62df\u5168\u9ebb\u4e0b\u884c\u53e3\u8154\u6cbb\u7597\u768480\u4f8b\u513f\u7ae5\u7259\u79d1\u60a3\u513f\u968f\u673a\u5206\u4e3aA\u7ec4\u548cB\u7ec4\uff0c\u6bcf\u7ec440\u4f8b\u3002A\u7ec4\u5728\u5168\u9ebb\u7ef4\u6301\u671f\u9759\u8109\u6ce8\u5c041 \u03bcg\u00b7kg\u207b\u00b9\u8d1f\u8377\u91cf\u53f3\u7f8e\u6258\u54aa\u5b9a\uff08\u751f\u7406\u76d0\u6c34\u7a00\u91ca\u81f310 mL\uff09\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4ee50.1~0.4 mL\u00b7\uff08kg\u00b7h\uff09\u207b\u00b9\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u9759\u8109\u6ce8\u5c04\u81f3\u624b\u672f\u7ed3\u675f\u524d45 min\uff0cB\u7ec4\u4ee5\u540c\u6837\u65b9\u5f0f\u6ce8\u5c04\u751f\u7406\u76d0\u6c34\u3002\u8bb0\u5f552\u7ec4\u60a3\u513f\u7684\u5e74\u9f84\uff0c\u6027\u522b\uff0c\u4f53\u91cd\uff0c\u7f8e\u56fd\u9ebb\u9189\u533b\u5e08\u534f\u4f1a\u75c5\u60c5\u5206\u7ea7\uff08ASAPS\uff09\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u7684\u5fc3\u7387\uff08HR\uff09\u3001\u5e73\u5747\u52a8\u8109\u538b\uff08MAP\uff09\u3001\u6c27\u9971\u548c\u5ea6\uff08SpO\u2082\uff09\uff0c\u8212\u82ac\u592a\u5c3c\u7528\u91cf\uff0c\u624b\u672f\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u624b\u672f\u7ed3\u675f\u5230\u62d4\u7ba1\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u62d4\u7ba1\u5230\u6e05\u9192\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u6e05\u9192\u540e\u884c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u5206\uff08FPAS\uff09\uff0c\u8fbe\u79bb\u9662\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7b49\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u3002\u7ed3\u679c 2\u7ec4\u624b\u672f\u5f00\u59cb\u3001\u624b\u672f10 min\u300130 min\u30011 h\u30012 h\u53ca\u62d4\u7ba1\u540e\u7684HR\u3001MAP\u5747\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u5dee\u5f02\uff0cA\u7ec4\u4f4e\u4e8eB\u7ec4\uff08P<0.05\uff09\uff1b\u8212\u82ac\u592a\u5c3c\u7528\u91cf\u53ca\u82cf\u9192\u671f\u8e81\u52a8\u7387\u4e5f\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u5dee\u5f02\uff0cA\u7ec4\u4f4e\u4e8eB\u7ec4\uff08P<0.05\uff09\uff1b2\u7ec4\u62d4\u7ba1\u5230\u6e05\u9192\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u53ca\u8fbe\u79bb\u9662\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3aA\u7ec4\u957f\u4e8eB\u7ec4\uff08P<0.05\uff09\u3002\u5176\u4ed6\u6307\u68072\u7ec4\u5747\u65e0\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u7ed3\u8bba \u53f3\u7f8e\u6258\u54aa\u5b9a\u7528\u4e8e\u513f\u7ae5\u7259\u79d1\u65e5\u95f4\u5168\u9ebb\u624b\u672f\uff0c\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u82cf\u9192\u671f\u8e81\u52a8\u53d1\u751f\u7387\uff0c\u672f\u4e2d\u751f\u547d\u4f53\u5f81\u66f4\u5e73\u7a33\u3002.", "doi": "10.7518/hxkq.2017.06.010", "title": "[Effect of dexmedetomidine on emergence agitation after general anesthesia in children undergoing odontotherapy in day-surgery operating room].", "journal": ["Hua xi kou qiang yi xue za zhi = Huaxi kouqiang yixue zazhi = West China journal of stomatology", "Hua Xi Kou Qiang Yi Xue Za Zhi"]}
