At the moment of second hospital admission, the patient was found somnolent and confused at home, with traumatic signs of biting of the tongue and urine emission. A couple days after admission, our patient became alert and presented hypersexuality, hypermetamorphosis, increased oral tendency, behavior changes including apathy with loss of anger and fear, and a very increased appetite, transient visual agnosia and right-left disorientation. In the initial phase, the patient could not recognize any members of his family, but he had a tendency to touch everything within his reach and place it into his mouth. The KBS presented in this case, following an ischemic stroke of the right temporal lobe provides distinct and intriguing insights into the possible pathophysiology of this syndrome. Often disruption of consciousness during recovery period may hide the clinical manifestation of the syndrome.", "doi": null, "title": "Clinical manifestations and morphological changes in one case with post-stroke Kl\u00fcver-Bucy syndrome.", "journal": ["Romanian journal of morphology and embryology = Revue roumaine de morphologie et embryologie", "Rom J Morphol Embryol"]}
