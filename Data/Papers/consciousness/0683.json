One colors the picture of other. Although it is thought that children carry lower risk for PNES than adults, this may represent the under-diagnosis of this condition in childhood due to few studies on this specific topic. Again, true seizure can be misdiagnosed by dramatic and varied manifestations appearing as psychological phenomena. We report a case of a 9-year-old boy presenting with sudden onset, short lasting, off and on different \"melodramatic\" episodic behavioral problems with La-Belle' indifference without loss of consciousness, appearing to be of psychogenic origin but finally ended with a diagnosis of temporal lobe epilepsy and responded dramatically with antiepileptics. The goal of this case report is to alert the reader to be cautious about rarer presentations of epilepsy and see each case holistically which may be misguided as PNES.", "doi": "10.4103/0253-7176.211761", "title": "Temporal Lobe Seizures Presenting as Abrupt Clinging Behavior in a Child.", "journal": ["Indian journal of psychological medicine", "Indian J Psychol Med"]}
