He showed that the ability to identify fragments of pictures seen 17\u202fyears before was significantly higher than for new stimuli. Is this true only for implicit memory? In this study, we tested whether explicit memory was still possible for drawings (n\u202f=\u202f144) that had been presented once or three times, two seconds each time on average, approximately 12\u202fyears earlier. Surprisingly, our data reveal that our participants were able to recognize pictures above chance level. Preserved memory was mainly observed in the youngest subjects, for stimuli seen three times. Despite the fact that confidence judgments were low, reports suggest that recognition could be based on a strong sense of familiarity. These data extend Mitchell's findings and show that familiarity can also be robust to decay.", "doi": "10.1016/j.cognition.2017.10.009", "title": "Extremely long-term memory and familiarity after 12\u202fyears.", "journal": ["Cognition", "Cognition"]}
