Current ambulatory ECG monitoring technologies include 24-hour Holter, wearable event recorder, external loop recorder (ELR), and insertable cardiac monitoring (ICM). Of them, Holter ECG is most frequently used in daily practice in Japan, while ELR and ICM are less frequently used. However, the appropriate monitor choice should be based on the expected frequency of symptoms. Frequent events may be adequately detected by Holter ECG, but less frequent symptoms are more effectively assessed by longer-term monitoring (i.e., ELR or ICM). In this report, based on our clinical experience, we review the usefulness of ambulatory ECG monitoring devices, especially of ELR, for evaluating T-LOC and other potentially arrhythmia-related symptoms. Specifically, we focus on the use of ELR and ICM for evaluating Japanese patients with T-LOC.", "doi": "10.1016/j.joa.2017.04.012", "title": "Ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring devices for evaluating transient loss of consciousness or other related symptoms.", "journal": ["Journal of arrhythmia", "J Arrhythm"]}
