As a neuropsychiatric disorder with an underlying organic cause, delirium has been considered a diagnosis reserved for the hospital setting. However, delirium is known to occur as both an acute and subacute condition that carries significant morbidity and mortality. Combined with its association with dementia and aging, this makes delirium an important topic for primary care providers to become more familiar with as they are tasked with caring for an aging population.", "doi": "10.1016/j.pop.2017.04.010", "title": "Delirium.", "journal": ["Primary care", "Prim.
