Behavioural impairment has been observed since the previous five months. Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) revealed isolated bilateral, symmetric, confluent temporal white matter lesions involving also corticospinal tracts, with sparing of the parieto-occipital and frontal white matter. This report outlines an atypical neuroradiological localization of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy and neuropsychological findings not specifically related to the brain involvement seen at the MRI.", "doi": "10.1016/j.braindev.2017.10.005", "title": "A novel temporal pattern of childhood cerebral X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy.", "journal": ["Brain & development", "Brain Dev."]}
