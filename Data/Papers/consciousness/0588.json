This paper relies entirely on my previous interdisciplinary work in mathematical logic, computer science and machine's theology, where \"theology\" is used here in the sense of Plato: it is the truth, or the \"truth-theory\" (in the sense of logicians) about a machine that the machine can either deduce from some of its primitive beliefs, or can be intuited in some sense that eventually is made clear through the modal logic of machine self-reference. Such a theology appears to be testable, because it has been shown that physics has to be necessarily retrieved from it when we assume the mechanist hypothesis in the cognitive sciences, and this in a unique precise (introspective) way, so that we only need to compare the physics of the introspective machine with the physics inferred from the human observation; and up to now, it is the only theory known to fit both the existence of personal \"consciousness\" (undoubtable yet unjustifiable truth) and quanta and quantum relationships (Marchal, 1998; Marchal, 2004; Marchal, 2013; Marchal, 2015).", "doi": "10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2017.08.017", "title": "The East, the West and the universal machine.", "journal": ["Progress in biophysics and molecular biology", "Prog.
