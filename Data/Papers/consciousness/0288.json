Hookah or waterpipe smoking is increasing, especially among youth and young adults. Social media sites describe the \"hookah high\" or \"buzz\", which may be related to nicotine, carbon monoxide, or other inhalants in hookah smoke. Most important is the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning. Case reports include a high number of victims presenting with loss of consciousness from either syncope or seizures. Anaphylaxis and a very rare respiratory hypersensitivity reaction, acute eosinophilic pneumonia, have also been reported from hookah smoking in previously healthy young adults. This article provides background information on hookah smoking, describes hookah-induced acute injuries that could precipitate poison center calls, and offers suggestions for exposure characterization.", "doi": "10.1080/15563650.2017.1400556", "title": "Calls to Poison Centers for hookah smoking exposures.", "journal": ["Clinical toxicology (Philadelphia, Pa.)", "Clin Toxicol (Phila)"]}
