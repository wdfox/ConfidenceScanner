The patient experiences and confronts in solitude his adverse experience. This experience is complex, not only are the symptoms of the disease, they also include disability, isolation, fear, dependence and sometimes guilt. Phenomenology attaches a paramount importance to the data in the consciousness of the patient, as facts given with absolute value. The purpose of this paper is to deepen the experience of the healthy adult individual who is ill. The better understanding of this phenomenology of the patient by the physician and the health personnel, can favor a better efficiency, empathy and compassion in their care.", "doi": "10.24875/GMM.17003009", "title": "An approach to the phenomenology of the disease.", "journal": ["Gaceta medica de Mexico", "Gac Med Mex"]}
