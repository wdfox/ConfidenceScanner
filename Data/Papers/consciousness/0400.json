A 78-year-old man presented to the emergency department with complaints of pain and coldness of the left lower extremity. The left femoral artery pulse was detected, while the pulses of the left popliteal, dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibialis arteries were absent. No blood inflow was detected in the superficial and deep femoral, popliteal, and anterior and posterior tibialis arteries. Thrombectomy was performed, and a fatty-like mass from the bifurcation of the common femoral artery and a thrombotic mass from the proximal portion of the superficial and deep femoral arteries were removed. The pulsatile inflow and palpable pulses of the left femoral, popliteal, dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibialis arteries were restored after surgery. The histological findings of the embolus were suggestive of a cardiac myxoma. The patient's consciousness and lower limb blood flow improved gradually. He was discharged from the hospital with full awareness and improved lower extremity muscle function 2 weeks after surgery.", "doi": null, "title": "Central Nervous System and Limb Embolism Concurrence due to Atrial Myxoma: A Case Report\u200f.", "journal": ["The journal of Tehran Heart Center", "J Tehran Heart Cent"]}
