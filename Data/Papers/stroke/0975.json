Here, we assessed changes in the life situation of informal caregivers of stroke survivors enrolled in a multimodal intervention trial. Methods This controlled study was a questionnaire-based survey accompanying a three-armed randomized controlled trial of 123 stroke survivors. The care recipients of 106 caregivers who chose to participate were assigned to rhythm-and-music-based therapy (R-MT; n\u00a0=\u00a037), horse-riding therapy (H-RT; n\u00a0=\u00a037), or delayed intervention (control group, n\u00a0=\u00a032). Perceived changes in the life situation of the caregivers were evaluated with the Life Situation among Spouses after the Stroke Event (LISS) questionnaire before randomization, after the 12-week intervention, and 3 and 6\u00a0months later. Results After the intervention, the change in the median LISS score was significantly higher among intervention caregivers (1.5 [interquartile range (IQR) 8.8]) than controls (1.5 [IQR 8.8] vs. 0.0 [IQR 12.0], p\u00a0=\u00a00.036). The improvement was maintained at 3\u00a0months (1.5 [IQR 9.0] vs. 0.0 [IQR 10.5], p\u00a0=\u00a00.039) but not at 6\u00a0months (p\u00a0=\u00a00.284). Conclusion Engaging stroke survivors in multimodal interventions late after stroke appears to have potential to produce gains also in the general life situation of informal caregivers.", "doi": "10.1080/10749357.2017.1413761", "title": "Multimodal rehabilitation in the late phase after stroke enhances the life situation of informal caregivers.", "journal": ["Topics in stroke rehabilitation", "Top Stroke Rehabil"]}
