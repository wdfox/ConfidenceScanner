Many stroke centers perform CT angiography (CTA) in patients with suspected LVO, however this requires additional time and contrast administration. Non-enhanced CT maximum intensity projection (NECT-MIPs) may offer a rapid alternative to CTA.We retrospectively reviewed acute stroke patients with LVO in the UCSD Stroke Registry, presenting between 6/2014-7/2016. NECT-MIPs were evaluated for presence of LVO. Gold standard comparison was to CTA. Results were stratified by level of training (Faculty, Fellow and Acute Care Practitioners [ACPs]). Inter-rater agreement was assessed using Fleiss' Kappa Coefficient.We reviewed 24 patients using NECT-MIPs for the detection of LVO. Faculty had a sensitivity and specificity of 95% & 92% for ICA/M1, 42% & 100% for M2, and 67% & 96% for basilar occlusions. Fellows and ACPs had a sensitivity and specificity of 61% & 94% for ICA/M1, 19% & 83% for M2, and 75% & 95% for basilar occlusions. Inter-rater agreement among Faculty readers was k=0.75 for ICA/M1, k=0.79 for M2 and k=0.14 for basilar occlusions. Among Fellows and ACPs, k=0.57 for ICA/M1, k=0.40 for M2, and k=0.27 for basilar occlusions.NECT-MIPs have high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of LVO when compared to CTA. Inter-rater agreement is fair and higher amongst more experienced reviewers. These results suggest that NECT-MIPs may be helpful to streamline the identification of LVO and reduce door to needle and door to intervention times.", "doi": null, "title": "Non-enhanced CT Maximum Intensity Projections for the Detection of Large Vessel Occlusions.", "journal": ["Austin journal of cerebrovascular disease & stroke", "Austin J Cerebrovasc Dis Stroke"]}
