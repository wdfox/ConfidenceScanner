Measurement and calculation of central hemodynamic parameters can comprehensively evaluate the cardiovascular functions. This study aims to compare the central hemodynamics between young basketball athletes and matched controls.Total 19 young long-term trained male basketball athletes and 17 matched male recreationally active controls participated. The central hemodynamic parameters such as central blood pressure, pulse pressure, heart rate (HR), augmentation index normalised to 75\u2009bpm (AIx@HR75), augmentation index (AIx), ejection duration (ED), sub-endocardial viability ratio (SEVR) were measured, and total peripheral resistance (TPR), stroke volume (SV) and cardiac output (CO) were calculated. Non-parameter tests and t-test were used to analyse the central hemodynamic parameters between athletes and controls.HR (56\u2009\u00b1\u20095\u2009bpm versus 79\u2009\u00b1\u20099\u2009bpm, p\u2009<\u2009.001), AIx@HR75 (-8\u2009\u00b1\u200910% versus -1\u2009\u00b1\u200910%, p\u2009<\u2009.05), ED (28\u2009\u00b1\u20092% versus 36\u2009\u00b1\u20093%, p\u2009<\u2009.001) and TPR (0.004\u2009\u00b1\u20090.006\u2009mmHg\u2009s/mL versus 0.012\u2009\u00b1\u20090.006\u2009mmHg\u2009s/mL, p\u2009<\u2009.001) were significantly lower in basketball athletes compared to the controls. SEVR (231\u2009\u00b1\u200932% versus 159\u2009\u00b1\u200921%, p\u2009<\u2009.001) and SV (154\u2009\u00b1\u200950\u2009mL versus 101\u2009\u00b1\u200943\u2009mL, p\u2009<\u2009.01) were significantly higher in basketball athletes than those in the controls. However, there were no significant differences in central blood pressure, pulse pressure, AIx and CO between them.There is no negative effect on central hemodynamics in young basketball athletes after long-term exercise training. The young basketball athletes have a higher myocardial perfusion, higher efficiency of blood supply, stronger vascular functions and better balance of myocardial oxygen of supply and demand than the controls in this central hemodynamic parameters analysis.", "doi": "10.1080/00015385.2017.1421123", "title": "Comparison of central hemodynamic parameters for young basketball athletes and control group.", "journal": ["Acta cardiologica", "Acta Cardiol"]}
