The purpose of the current study was to perform an in-depth analysis of outcomes after SAVR in PARTNER-2A.From 1/2012-1/2014, 937 patients underwent SAVR at 57 centers. Mean age was 82\u00b16.7 and 55% were men. Less-invasive operations were performed in 140 (15%) and concomitant procedures in 198 (21%). Major outcomes and echocardiograms were adjudicated by an independent events committee. Follow-up was 94% complete to 2 years.Operative mortality was 4.1% (n=38, STS PROM 5.2\u00b12.3%), O/E 0.8, and in-hospital stroke 5.4% (n=51), twice expected. Aortic clamp and bypass times were 75\u00b130 and 104\u00b146 minutes. Patients having severe prosthesis-patient mismatch (n=260, 33%) had similar survival to those without (P>.9), as did those undergoing less-invasive SAVR (P=.3). Risk factors for death included cachexia (P=.004), tricuspid regurgitation (P=.01), coronary artery disease (P=.02), preoperative atrial fibrillation (P=.001), higher white cell count (P<.0001), and lower hemoglobin (P=.0002).In this adjudicated prospective study, SAVR in intermediate-risk patients had excellent results at 2 years. However, there were more in-hospital strokes than expected, most likely attributable to mandatory neurologic assessment post-procedure. There was no significant structural valve deterioration during 2-year follow-up. Continued long-term surveillance remains important.", "doi": "10.1016/j.athoracsur.2017.10.062", "title": "Outcomes in 937 Intermediate-Risk Patients Undergoing Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement in PARTNER 2A.", "journal": ["The Annals of thoracic surgery", "Ann.
