The purpose of the present study was to assess the three-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography-derived right atrial volumetric and functional properties between hypereosinophilic syndrome patients and matched controls.A total of 11\u00a0patients with idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome and 22 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were enrolled in the study. Three-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography was used for calculation of right atrial volumes, volume-based functional properties, and strain parameters.Significantly increased right atrial maximum (68.7\u00a0\u00b1 33.1\u2009ml vs. 40.3\u00a0\u00b1 12.1\u2009ml, respectively; p\u00a0= 0.001) and minimum volumes (48.3\u00a0\u00b1 31.0\u2009ml vs. 28.3\u00a0\u00b1 9.4\u2009ml, respectively; p\u00a0= 0.009), as well as right atrial volume before atrial contraction (58.6\u00a0\u00b1 27.3\u2009ml vs. 34.5\u00a0\u00b1 11.8\u2009ml, respectively; p\u00a0= 0.001), were found in hypereosinophilic syndrome patients compared with controls. Total and passive right atrial stroke volumes proved to be significantly increased in hypereosinophilic syndrome patients. However, global and mean segmental strain parameters did not differ significantly between the groups.Increased cyclic right atrial volumes and mild alterations in right atrial functional properties could be demonstrated in idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome patients.", "doi": "10.1007/s00059-017-4652-4", "title": "The right atrium in idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome : Insights from the 3D speckle tracking echocardiographic MAGYAR-Path Study.", "journal": ["Herz", "Herz"]}
