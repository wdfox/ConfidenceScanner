In a prospectively designed study, 27 patients with various grades of MR underwent CMR and echo-Doppler on the same day. By CMR, multiple slices were obtained parallel to the mitral valve by phase-contrast imaging, using 3D velocity vectors, as well as short-axis cine images for left and right ventricular volume measurements. Using dedicated software developed in our laboratory, the perimeter of the proximal flow convergence region was semi-automatically measured for each temporal phase, and for each short-axis slice. The CMR-PISA RVol was calculated as the sum of PISA perimeters throughout systole, multiplied by slice width. For comparison, CMR-volumetric RVol was calculated by 2 methods: Volumetric (difference between left and right ventricular stroke volumes) and Flow-based (stroke volume -aortic flow). Echo-PISA RVol was calculated by echo-Doppler based PISA method. RVol by CMR-PISA correlated highly with echo-PISA (r\u2009=\u20090.87) and with CMR-volumetric (r\u2009=\u20090.86) and CMR-flow (r\u2009=\u20090.72). For comparison Doppler-RVol and CMR-volume-based RVol had r\u2009=\u20090.83. On average CMR-PISA was 16\u2009\u00b1\u200925\u00a0ml less than echo-PISA, but 12\u2009\u00b1\u200922\u00a0ml larger than CMR-volumetric RVol. The observed 3D shape of the PISA envelope by 4D-CMR resembled a hemiellipsoid rather than a hemisphere. This feasibility study suggests that CMR-based 4D-PISA may be able to assess MR severity quantitatively without any geometric assumptions.", "doi": "10.1007/s10554-017-1290-0", "title": "Assessment of mitral regurgitation by 3-dimensional proximal flow convergence using magnetic resonance imaging: comparison with echo-Doppler.", "journal": ["The international journal of cardiovascular imaging", "Int J Cardiovasc Imaging"]}
