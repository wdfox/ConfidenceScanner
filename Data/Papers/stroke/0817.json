Though differentiation of M2 macrophages has been recently linked to fatty acid oxidation (FAO), whether FAO plays a role in functional maintenance of M2 macrophages is still unclear. Here, we used an in vitro model to mimic TAM-HCC interaction in tumor microenvironment. We found that M2 monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) enhanced the proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells through an FAO-dependent way. Further investigations identified that IL-1\u03b2 mediated the pro-migratory effect of M2 MDM. Using etomoxir and siRNA to inhibit FAO and palmitate to enhance FAO, we showed that FAO was responsible for the up-regulated secretion of IL-1\u03b2 and, thus, the pro-migratory effect in M2 MDMs. In addition, we proved that IL-1\u03b2 induction was reactive oxygen species and NLRP3-dependent. Our study demonstrates that FAO plays a key role in functional human M2 macrophages by enhancing IL-1\u03b2 secretion to promote HCC cell migration. These findings provide evidence for different dependency of energy sources in macrophages with distinct phenotypes and functions, and suggest a novel strategy to treat HCC by reprogramming cell metabolism or modulating tumor microenvironment.", "doi": "10.1016/j.molimm.2017.12.011", "title": "Fatty acid oxidation contributes to IL-1\u03b2 secretion in M2 macrophages and promotes macrophage-mediated tumor cell migration.", "journal": ["Molecular immunology", "Mol.
