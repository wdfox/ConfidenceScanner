All in-patients diagnosed with atrial fibrillation were included.Total 205 patients were studied. There were 154 (75.1%) nonvalvular and 51 (24.9%) valvular causes for atrial fibrillation. Common presentations were shortness of breath 84 (41%), palpitations 57 (27.8%) and stroke 38 (24.6 %). For valvular causes, common lesion was of mitral valve (90%). Warfarin was used in 32 (62.7%) with mean INR of 2.038 \u00b1 0.6. Seventeen (53.1%) had INR below 2. In nonvalvular cases, types were paroxysmal (55.2%), persistent (34.4%) and permanent (10.4%). Common risk factors were heart failure 87 (56.5%), old age (>75 years) 66 (42.8%), hypertension 47 (30.5%), dilated cardiomyopathy 23 (14.9%), degenerative multivalvular heart disease 23 (14.9%) and ischemic heart disease (13.6%). CHADS(2) calculated 2 or more were in 98 (63.6%) patients. Warfarin was used in 39 (25.3%) and aspirin was used in 103 (66.9%) patients in CHADS(2) score 2 or more. Mean INR in nonvalvular AF was 1.5 \u00b10.4.Atrial fibrillation occurred as a result of valvular or nonvalvular origin. Common presentations were shortness of breath, palpitations and stroke. Common risk factors in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation were old age, hypertension and heart failure. Warfarin was underused in nonvalvular cases in our setting.", "doi": null, "title": "Clinical Profile of Atrial Fibrillation in a Tertiary Hospital in Central Nepal.", "journal": ["JNMA; journal of the Nepal Medical Association", "JNMA J Nepal Med Assoc"]}
