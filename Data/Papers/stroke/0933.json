In 2015, all tilt tests within the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa (HUS) were performed in the clinical physiology unit of the HUS Medical Imaging Center at Peijas Hospital.The patients' medical history, circulation monitor printouts, and medical reports were recorded from all tilt tests carried out during 2015. Positive tilt tests were classified according to the VASIS classification and the elapsed time to loss of consciousness was observed.Among a total of 133 patients, abnormal upright tolerance was found in 30 per cent of the patients. The average time to loss of consciousness was 35.2 minutes. The most common mechanism of syncope was mixed reaction (60.0%), whereas vasovagal reaction (22.5%), cardioinhibitory reaction (10.0%), and lacking stroke volume response (7.5%) were less common.Practices of referral for the tilt table test vary among the different units of HUS. In our material, the cardioinhibitory reaction was less common than in previous studies.", "doi": null, "title": "Time has not passed for the tilt table test.", "journal": ["Duodecim; laaketieteellinen aikakauskirja", "Duodecim"]}
