Multiple alterations have been linked to its use, including cerebrovascular disease (CVD) or stroke, whose association with the substance has been based mainly on the hypothesis of transient vasoconstriction, which explains a large proportion of the cases reported. However, epidemiological studies have not performed an individual analysis of patients without other cardiovascular risk factors, which may limit the estimation of the risk of stroke associated with cannabis use alone.A systematic literature review was conducted through Medline, EBSCOhost, EMBASE, Lilacs, and Scielo to gather case reports published before 13 May 2016 presenting patients with a diagnosis of CVD or transient ischaemic attack, a history of cannabinoid use, and no other cardiovascular risk factors. Key words such as stroke, cerebrovascular disease, cannabis, and marijuana, among others, were used. A total of 18 case reports were selected from the 566 references found.There is a wide variety of reports of stroke associated with cannabis use in patients with no other risk factors. Noteworthy findings were presentation at young age and a strong temporal association, which place cannabis use as a potential risk factor for this population in line with the epidemiological and pathophysiological studies in this area.", "doi": "10.1016/j.nrl.2017.09.016", "title": "Stroke and cannabis use in patients with no cardiovascular risk factors: a systematic review of case reports.", "journal": ["Neurologia (Barcelona, Spain)", "Neurologia"]}
