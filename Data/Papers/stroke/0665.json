This phenomenon could present as dural venous sinus hyperintensity on arterial spin labeling (ASL)-MRI and could be indicative of capillary shunting. Here, the prevalence of ASL venous hyperintensities and association with relevant physiology in adults with SCA was investigated. SCA ( n\u2009=\u200946) and age-matched control ( n\u2009=\u200916) volunteers were recruited for 3.0\u2009T MRI. Pseudo-continuous ASL-MRI was acquired for cerebral blood flow (CBF) calculation and venous hyperintensity determination; venous signal intensity and a categorical venous score (three raters; 0\u2009=\u2009no hyperintensity, 1\u2009=\u2009focal hyperintensity, and 2\u2009=\u2009diffuse hyperintensity) were recorded. Flow velocity in cervical internal carotid artery segments was determined from phase contrast data (venc\u2009=\u200940\u2009cm/s) and whole-brain oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) was determined from T2-relaxation-under-spin-tagging MRI. Cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen was calculated as the product of OEF, CBF, and blood oxygen content. ASL venous hyperintensities were significantly ( p\u2009<\u20090.001) more prevalent in SCA (65%) relative to control (6%) participants and were associated with elevated flow velocities ( p\u2009=\u20090.03). CBF ( p\u2009<\u20090.001), but not OEF, increased with increasing hyperintensity score. Prospective trials that evaluate this construct as a possible marker of impaired oxygen delivery and stroke risk may be warranted.", "doi": "10.1177/0271678X17746808", "title": "Preliminary evidence for cerebral capillary shunting in adults with sickle cell anemia.", "journal": ["Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism", "J.
