She presented to the emergency department four days post ablation and was admitted the hospital for overnight observation. Serial neurological examinations and neuroimaging were unremarkable for stroke or transient ischemic attack. The patient had some brief transient visual changes which resolved completely after several days, with no further clinical sequelae. She followed up in the outpatient neuro-ophthalmology clinic and had a normal visual field examination. She was given a diagnosis of new onset migraine with visual aura.", "doi": "10.4022/jafib.1646", "title": "New migraine with visual disturbance after cryoballoon ablation of atrial fibrillation.", "journal": ["Journal of atrial fibrillation", "J Atr Fibrillation"]}
