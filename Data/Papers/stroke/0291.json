The presence of diabetes and hypertension significantly increases the risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Although compelling evidence exists from randomized controlled trials demonstrating that blood pressure (BP) reduction effectively prevents cardiovascular complications, optimal BP targets remain uncertain and continue to be the subject of ongoing controversy. Until recently, most major clinical practice guidelines recommended a BP target of < 130/80 mm Hg, but some expert panels have raised their recommended treatment targets in recent years. The primary benefit of more intensive BP reduction appears to be prevention of stroke, but this is balanced against an increase in treatment burden, side effects, and cost. The purpose of this review is to summarize the global body of evidence evaluating BP targets as well as to compare the recommendations from different clinical practice guidelines, which inform the treatment of patients with hypertension and diabetes.", "doi": "10.1016/j.cjca.2017.10.024", "title": "Blood Pressure-Lowering Targets in Patients With Diabetes Mellitus.", "journal": ["The Canadian journal of cardiology", "Can J Cardiol"]}
