Leptin, adiponectin, and resistin are the most studied adipokines which play important roles in the regulation of cardiovascular homeostasis. Leptin and adiponectin mediate both proatherogenic and antiatherogenic responses. Leptin and adiponectin have been linked to the development of coronary heart disease and may be involved in the underlying biological mechanism of ischemic stroke. Resistin, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, is predictive of atherosclerosis and poor clinical outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease and ischemic stroke. The changes in serum levels of novel adipokines apelin, visfatin are also associated with acute ischemic stroke. These adipokines have been proposed as potential prognostic biomarkers of cardiovascular mortality/morbidity and therapeutic targets in patients with cardiometabolic diseases. In this article, we summarize the biologic role of the adipokines and discuss the link between dysfunctional adipose tissue and metabolic/inflammation imbalance, consequently endothelial damage, progression of atherosclerotic disease, and the occurrence of ischemic stroke.", "doi": "10.1016/j.biopha.2017.12.074", "title": "Adipokines in neurovascular diseases.", "journal": ["Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie", "Biomed.
