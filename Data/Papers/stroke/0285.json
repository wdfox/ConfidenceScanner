Even if traditional language therapies have been proved to induce an adequate clinical recovery, a large percentage of patients are left with chronic deficits at 6 months post-stroke. Therefore, new strategies to common speech therapies are urgently needed in order to maximize the recovery from aphasia. The recent application of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to language rehabilitation has already provided promising results. This brief review gives an overview of the most important results achieved using this approach and discusses how the application of this treatment might potentiate aphasia recovery.", "doi": "10.1016/j.neulet.2017.12.057", "title": "The potential effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on language functioning: Combining neuromodulation and behavioral intervention in aphasia.", "journal": ["Neuroscience letters", "Neurosci.
