In this study, a soft robotic sock device was developed, which can provide compliant actuation to the ankle joint in the early stage of stroke recovery. The device is fitted with soft extension actuators and when the actuators are inflated, they extend and guide the foot into plantarflexion; upon deflation, the actuators will resume their initial conformations. Each actuator is linked to a pneumatic pump-valve control system that injects pressurised air into or release air from the system. In this study, the design and characterisation of the soft actuators will be presented, where the theoretical and experimental forces generated by the actuators were compared. The performance of the device was also evaluated on healthy subjects and the results had shown that the device was able to move the subjects' ankles into cycles of dorsiflexion-plantarflexion, in the absence of voluntary muscle effort. The findings suggested that the soft wearable robotic device was capable of assisting the subjects in performing repeated cycles of ankle flexion.", "doi": "10.1080/03091902.2017.1411985", "title": "Design, characterisation and evaluation of a soft robotic sock device on healthy subjects for assisted ankle rehabilitation.", "journal": ["Journal of medical engineering & technology", "J Med Eng Technol"]}
