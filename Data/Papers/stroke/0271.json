Data were collected in 2017 from the Department of Informatics of the Brazilian Unified National Health System (DATASUS), where the Mortality Information System (SIM/SUS) was accessed. Linear regression analysis was used to estimate the temporal trend of stroke-related mortality according to sex, stroke subtypes, and regions. The confidence level adopted was 95%.There was a reduction in the mortality rates stratified according to sex, age groups above 15 years, and subtypes of stroke. Mortality from hemorrhagic and non-specified stroke decreased in all regions. However, a significant reduction in ischemic stroke-related mortality was observed only in the ABC region and in Brazil.The ABC region showed greater mortality due to stroke in males, the age group above 49 years, and non-specified stroke between 1997 and 2012.", "doi": "10.2174/1874192401711010111", "title": "Trends in Stroke-Related Mortality in the ABC Region, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil: An Ecological Study Between 1997 and 2012.", "journal": ["The open cardiovascular medicine journal", "Open Cardiovasc Med J"]}
