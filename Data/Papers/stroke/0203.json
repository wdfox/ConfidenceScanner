It is very uncommon finding among patients with ischemic stroke. In this article, we report a rare case of bilateral occlusion of internal carotid artery who presented with mild reversible neurological symptoms. Angiographic evaluation of her cerebral vasculature revealed no flow across the both cervical internal carotid arteries, but a run off through both posterior communicating arteries from the vertebrobasilar system. We performed a review of the pertinent literature and discussed different management option in these patients.", "doi": null, "title": "Whole Cerebral Blood Flow Originating From Vertebral Arteries After Bilateral Internal Carotid Arteries Occlusion: A Case Report.", "journal": ["Acta medica Iranica", "Acta Med Iran"]}
