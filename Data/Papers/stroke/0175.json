We examined disability, quality of life, survival and acute care costs in the EXTEND-IA trial, which used CT-perfusion imaging selection.Large vessel ischemic stroke patients with favorable CT-perfusion were randomized to endovascular thrombectomy after alteplase versus alteplase-only. Clinical outcome was prospectively measured using 90-day modified Rankin scale (mRS). Individual patient expected survival and net difference in Disability/Quality-adjusted life years (DALY/QALY) up to 15\u2009years from stroke were modeled using age, sex, 90-day mRS, and utility scores. Level of care within the first 90\u2009days was prospectively measured and used to estimate procedure and inpatient care costs (US$ reference year 2014).There were 70 patients, 35 in each arm, mean age 69, median NIHSS 15 (IQR 12-19). The median (IQR) disability-weighted utility score at 90\u2009days was 0.65 (0.00-0.91) in the alteplase-only versus 0.91 (0.65-1.00) in the endovascular group (p\u2009=\u20090.005). Modeled life expectancy was greater in the endovascular versus alteplase-only group (median 15.6 versus 11.2\u2009years, p\u2009=\u20090.02). The endovascular thrombectomy group had fewer simulated DALYs lost over 15\u2009years [median (IQR) 5.5 (3.2-8.7) versus 8.9 (4.7-13.8), p\u2009=\u20090.02] and more QALY gained [median (IQR) 9.3 (4.2-13.1) versus 4.9 (0.3-8.5), p\u2009=\u20090.03]. Endovascular patients spent less time in hospital [median (IQR) 5 (3-11) days versus 8 (5-14) days, p\u2009=\u20090.04] and rehabilitation [median (IQR) 0 (0-28) versus 27 (0-65) days, p\u2009=\u20090.03]. The estimated inpatient costs in the first 90\u2009days were less in the thrombectomy group (average US$15,689 versus US$30,569, p\u2009=\u20090.008) offsetting the costs of interhospital transport and the thrombectomy procedure (average US$10,515). The average saving per patient treated with thrombectomy was US$4,365.Thrombectomy patients with large vessel occlusion and salvageable tissue on CT-perfusion had reduced length of stay and overall costs to 90\u2009days. There was evidence of clinically relevant improvement in long-term survival and quality of life.http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01492725 (registered 20/11/2011).", "doi": "10.3389/fneur.2017.00657", "title": "Endovascular Thrombectomy for Ischemic Stroke Increases Disability-Free Survival, Quality of Life, and Life Expectancy and Reduces Cost.", "journal": ["Frontiers in neurology", "Front Neurol"]}
