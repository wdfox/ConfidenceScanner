Autopsy studies allow for a direct and complete evaluation of the atherosclerotic disease. We aimed to investigate the frequency of IAD and EAD, their association, and related risk profiles in a large cross-sectional autopsy study.We measured the intima-media thickness and stenosis of the common (CCA) and internal carotid arteries (ICA), using morphometric measurements. The main outcome was stenosis (\u226550%) in the artery with the largest obstruction among the 12 cerebral arteries. We used multivariable logistic regression models to investigate the association between EAD and IAD.In 661 participants (mean age\u00a0=\u00a071.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.7\u00a0y, 51% male), stenosis was more common in IAD than in EAD (59% vs. 51%). EAD was associated with Caucasian race, hypertension, and smoking, while IAD was associated with older age, less years of education, hypertension, diabetes, and a previous history of stroke. Stenosis in CCA and ICA was associated with more than two times the odds of having stenosis in the intracranial arteries (CCA: OR\u00a0=\u00a02.32, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.64; 3.28; ICA: OR\u00a0=\u00a02.51, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.76; 3.57).In this population-based autopsy study, IAD was common, even more common than EAD, but correlated with EAD.", "doi": "10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2017.12.015", "title": "Morphometric measurements of extracranial and intracranial atherosclerotic disease: A population-based autopsy study.", "journal": ["Atherosclerosis", "Atherosclerosis"]}
