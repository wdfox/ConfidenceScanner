In earlier C-BSE pathogenesis studies, cattle at 4-6\u00a0months of age were orally challenged, while there are strong indications that the risk of infection is highest in young animals. In the present study, unweaned calves aged 4-6\u00a0weeks were orally challenged to determine the earliest time point at which newly formed PrPBSE and BSE infectivity are detectable in the IPP. For this purpose, calves were culled 1\u00a0week as well as 2, 4, 6 and 8\u00a0months post-infection (mpi) and IPPs were examined for BSE infectivity using a bovine PrP transgenic mouse bioassay, and for PrPBSE by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) assays. For the first time, BSE prions were detected in the IPP as early as 2 mpi by transgenic mouse bioassay and PMCA and 4 mpi by IHC in the follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) of the IPP follicles. These data indicate that BSE prions propagate in the IPP of unweaned calves within 2\u00a0months of oral uptake of the agent.", "doi": "10.1186/s13567-017-0495-5", "title": "Detection of PrPBSE and prion infectivity in the ileal Peyer's patch of young calves as early as 2\u00a0months after oral challenge with classical bovine spongiform encephalopathy.", "journal": ["Veterinary research", "Vet.
