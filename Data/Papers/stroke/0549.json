The challenge for the physicians regarding the management of this situation is paramount since early management of one condition will inevitably delay the other. We present two illustrative cases of \"hyperacute simultaneous cardiocerebral infarction\" who presented with simultaneous cardiocerebral infarction and arrived at the hospital within the thrombolytic therapeutic window for acute ischemic stroke of 4.5\u2009h. We propose an algorithm for managing the patient with hyperacute simultaneous cardiocerebral infarction based on hemodynamic status and suggest close cardiac monitoring based on the site of cerebral infarction.", "doi": "10.3389/fneur.2017.00664", "title": "Hyperacute Simultaneous Cardiocerebral Infarction: Rescuing the Brain or the Heart First?", "journal": ["Frontiers in neurology", "Front Neurol"]}
