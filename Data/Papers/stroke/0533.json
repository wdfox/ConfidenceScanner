However, there is currently no biomarker with proven prognostic value in adult patients. Four-dimensional (4D) flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may improve risk profiling based on intracranial haemodynamics. We conducted neurovascular 4D flow MRI and blood sampling in 69 SCD patients [median age 15\u00a0years (interquartile range, IQR: 12-50)] and 14 healthy controls [median age 21\u00a0years (IQR: 18-43)]. We measured velocity, flow, lumen area and endothelial shear stress (ESS) in the CoW. SCD patients had lower haematocrit and viscosity, and higher velocity, flow and lumen area, with lower ESS compared to healthy controls. We observed significant age-related decline in haemodynamic 4D flow parameters; velocity (Spearman's \u03c1\u00a0=\u00a0-0\u00b736 to -0\u00b761), flow (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a0-0\u00b726 to -0\u00b752) and ESS (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a0-0\u00b714 to -0\u00b754) in SCD patients. Further analysis in only adults showed that velocity values were similar in SCD patients compared to healthy controls, but that the additional 4D flow parameters, flow and lumen area, were higher, and ESS lower, in the SCD group. Our data suggest that 4D flow MRI may identify adult patients with an increased stroke risk more accurately than current TCD-based velocity.", "doi": "10.1111/bjh.15043", "title": "Intracranial 4D flow magnetic resonance imaging reveals altered haemodynamics in sickle cell disease.", "journal": ["British journal of haematology", "Br.
