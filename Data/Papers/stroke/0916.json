This study aimed to examine the association between total cholesterol (TC) and mortality from total stroke and stroke subtypes.503,340 Korean adults aged 40-80 years without a history of heart disease or stroke participated in routine health examinations in 2002 and 2003, and were followed up until 2013. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for stroke (I60-I69) mortality were calculated.Nonlinear associations for total stroke (U-curve) and hemorrhagic stroke (L-curve), especially intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), but a linear association for ischemic stroke, were found. In the range <200\u00a0mg/dL, TC was inversely associated with stroke mortality (HR per 39\u00a0mg/dL [1\u00a0mmol/L] increase\u00a0=\u00a00.88 [95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.80-0.95]), mainly due to hemorrhagic stroke (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.78 [0.68-0.90]), especially ICH (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.72 [0.62-0.85]). In the upper range (200-349\u00a0mg/dL), TC was positively associated with stroke mortality (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.09 [1.01-1.16]); ICH and subarachnoid hemorrhage mortality showed no inverse association. The associations were generally similar in middle-aged (40-64 years) and elderly (\u226565 years) adults and, in the upper range, each 1\u00a0mmol/L (39\u00a0mg/dL) higher TC was associated with 11% higher mortality from stroke (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a02%-21%) in the elderly. Both middle-aged (39%) and elderly (23%) adults had higher ischemic stroke mortality associated with TC\u00a0\u2265240\u00a0mg/dL, compare to <200\u00a0mg/dL.TC level around 200\u00a0mg/dL was associated with the lowest risk of overall stroke in the elderly and middle-aged adults. No stroke subtype including ICH, was inversely associated with TC in the range \u2265200\u00a0mg/dL.", "doi": "10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2017.12.003", "title": "Total cholesterol and stroke mortality in middle-aged and elderly adults: A prospective cohort study.", "journal": ["Atherosclerosis", "Atherosclerosis"]}
