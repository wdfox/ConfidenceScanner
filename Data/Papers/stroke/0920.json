The advent of nonsurgical mechanical interventions for aortic stenosis (transcatheter aortic valve replacement) may alter the risk-benefit ratio for patients who would otherwise be at increased risk for valve surgery. This review describes the epidemiology and pathophysiology of aortic stenosis with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction and summarizes the current registry and clinical trial data applicable to this frequently encountered high-risk group. It concludes with discussion of ongoing trials, new approaches, emerging indications, and a potential clinical algorithm incorporating optimal mechanical intervention for patients with aortic stenosis and concomitant reduced ejection fraction.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jacc.2017.10.040", "title": "Mechanical Intervention for Aortic Valve Stenosis\u00a0in Patients With Heart Failure and\u00a0Reduced\u00a0Ejection Fraction.", "journal": ["Journal of the American College of Cardiology", "J.
