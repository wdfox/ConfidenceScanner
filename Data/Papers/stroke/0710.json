We present a technique to manage temporalis wasting at the time of cranioplasty. Using poly methyl methacrylate, a small temporal implant is placed during cranioplasty. This is both a simple and cost effective technique for temporal augmentation at the time of cranioplasty.", "doi": "10.1080/02688697.2017.1418291", "title": "Temporal augmentation with poly methyl methacrylate at the time of autologous cranioplasty.", "journal": ["British journal of neurosurgery", "Br J Neurosurg"]}
