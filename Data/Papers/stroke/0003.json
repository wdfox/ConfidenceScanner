This study-level meta-analysis included 4 controlled randomized trials and 6,036 patients with a clinical indication to chronic oral anticoagulation (OAC) after PCI, mainly for atrial fibrillation. Patients receiving dual therapy with a single antiplatelet agent, essentially a P2Y12 inhibitor, plus OAC were compared with those treated with triple therapy (aspirin, a P2Y12 inhibitor, and OAC). The incidence of the following outcomes was evaluated: Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction major and minor bleeding, MI, stent thrombosis, stroke, cardiovascular, and all-cause death. Occurrence of Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction major bleeding was significantly lower in patients treated with dual therapy: 1.97% versus 3.53% in those on triple therapy (odds ratios 0.55, 95% confidence interval 0.39 to 0.78, p\u2009=\u20090.0007); rates of minor bleeding were also decreased in the former (57% relative reduction). With dual therapy, there was not a statistically significant difference in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality (3.81% vs 4.01%, p\u2009=\u20090.37 and 1.62% vs 2.02%, p\u2009=\u20090.42, respectively). Incidence of MI (3.25% vs 2.78%, p\u2009=\u20090.61), definite stent thrombosis (0.92% vs 0.66%, p\u2009=\u20090.46), and stroke (1.28% vs 1.32%, p\u2009=\u20090.85) was similar in the 2 treatment strategies. In patients with long-term indication to OAC after PCI, compared with triple therapy, dual antithrombotic therapy reduces bleeding, without an excess in thromboembolic and ischemic cardiac events.", "doi": "10.1016/j.amjcard.2017.12.014", "title": "Meta-Analysis Comparing the Safety and Efficacy of Dual Versus Triple Antithrombotic Therapy in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention.", "journal": ["The American journal of cardiology", "Am.
