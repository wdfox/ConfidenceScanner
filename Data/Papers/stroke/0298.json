The association of vascular indices with circulating biomarkers of inflammation and insulin resistance and their role in the long-term cardiovascular prognosis in T2DM patients were currently investigated.Patients with T2DM and poor glycemic control without known cardiovascular diseases (n=119) at baseline were enrolled and followed for about 9years. The end-point was the occurrence of any cardiovascular event (coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral artery disease or cardiovascular death). Aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV), augmentation index (AIx), brachial flow-mediated dilation (FMD), hsCRP, Chitinase-3-like protein 1 (YKL-40), Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin (NGAL), Fatty Acid Binding Protein (FABP-4) were assessed.Higher YKL-40 and NGAL were associated with higher PWV, while higher YKL-40 and FABP-4 were related to higher AIx (p<0.05 for all). In univariate Cox regression analysis, PWV>10m/s, YKL-40>78ng/ml and NGAL>42ng/ml were associated with cardiovascular events (p<0.05 for all). In multivariate analysis, after adjusting for classical risk factors and glycemic control, increased NGAL, YKL-40 and PWV and decreased FMD (i.e. \u22642.2%) (p<0.05 for all) were independently associated with cardiovascular events.In T2DM patients without established cardiovascular disease, novel indices of vascular inflammation (NGAL and YKL-40) were associated with subclinical atherosclerosis (arterial stiffness) but also with adverse clinical prognosis. Arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction were also independently related to adverse prognosis.", "doi": "10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2017.12.010", "title": "Association of vascular indices with novel circulating biomarkers as prognostic factors for cardiovascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.", "journal": ["Clinical biochemistry", "Clin.
