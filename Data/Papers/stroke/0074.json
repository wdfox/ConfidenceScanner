Transcranial magnetic stimulation and diffusion weight imaging indexed structure and function of the corticospinal tract and corpus callosum. Separate models of the relationship between possible biomarkers and motor outcomes at a single chronic (\u22656 months) time point post stroke were performed.Age (\u0394R20.365, p = 0.017) and ipsilesional-transcallosal inhibition (\u0394R20.182, p = 0.048) explained a 54.7% (p = 0.009) variance in paretic WMFT-rate. Prefrontal corpus callous fractional anisotropy (PF-CC FA) alone explained 49.3% (p = 0.007) variance in FM-UL outcome. The same models did not explain significant variance in mild-moderate stroke. In the severe group, k-means cluster analysis of PF-CC FA distinguished two subgroups, separated by a clinically meaningful and significant difference in motor impairment (p = 0.049) and function (p = 0.006) outcomes.Corpus callosum function and structure were identified as possible biomarkers of motor outcome in people with chronic and severe arm impairment.", "doi": "10.1155/2017/4281532", "title": "Interhemispheric Pathways Are Important for Motor Outcome in Individuals with Chronic and Severe Upper Limb Impairment Post Stroke.", "journal": ["Neural plasticity", "Neural Plast."]}
