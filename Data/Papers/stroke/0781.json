Lately, with increasing fund of knowledge about its potential role in cardio embolic phenomena, we have seen an increased trend in the use different techniques to exclude left atrial appendage from main left atrial chamber, in an effort to alleviate the stroke risk and therefore the need for long term anticoagulation. Clinical implications of absent left atrial appendage in such patients remains a mystery.", "doi": "10.4022/jafib.1730", "title": "Congenital Absence of Left Atrial Appendage.", "journal": ["Journal of atrial fibrillation", "J Atr Fibrillation"]}
