As TAVR use increases, spurred by technological advances in valve design and patient preferences for the less-invasive procedure, studies have provided data supporting the efficacy and safety of TAVR. Recently, TAVR has expanded to intermediate-risk patients, increasing the potential patient population. Although emerging evidence supports its use in lower-risk patients, some adverse events may limit its adoption in a wider patient population. These include stroke, paravalvular leak, valve durability, valve thrombosis, and need for pacemaker replacement. Ongoing clinical trials are expected to provide answers.", "doi": "10.3949/ccjm.84.s4.03", "title": "Expanding indications for TAVR: The preferred procedure in intermediate-risk patients?", "journal": ["Cleveland Clinic journal of medicine", "Cleve Clin J Med"]}
