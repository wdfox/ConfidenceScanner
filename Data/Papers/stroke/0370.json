The current proof-of-concept study was designed to determine whether serum VILIP-1 levels increase post-injury in a well-characterized rat unilateral cortical contusion model.Lateral flow devices (LFDs) rapidly (<\u00a020\u00a0min) detected trace serum levels (pg/mL) of VILIP-1 in a small input sample volume (10\u00a0\u00b5L). Temporal profiles of serum levels at baseline and post-injury were measured in male Sprague Dawley rats subjected to very mild-, mild unilateral-cortical contusion, or na\u00efve surgery and in male Sprague Dawley rats following a diffuse TBI or sham surgery.Mean serum levels were significantly elevated by 0.5\u00a0h post-injury and remained so throughout the temporal profile compared with baseline in very mild and mild unilateral contusions but not in na\u00efve surgeries. Serum levels were also elevated in a small cohort of animals subjected to a diffuse TBI injury.Overall, the current study demonstrates that the novel LFD is a reliable and rapid point-of-care diagnostic for the detection and quantification of serum levels of UB-VILIP-1 in a clinically relevant time frame.", "doi": "10.1080/02699052.2017.1418907", "title": "A novel method for the rapid detection of post-translationally modified visinin-like protein 1 in rat models of brain injury.", "journal": ["Brain injury", "Brain Inj"]}
