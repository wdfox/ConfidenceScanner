Herein, we present a rare case of migrainous infarct without aura. The diagnosis was challenging due to lack of risk factors. The patient was unique in not having any other comorbidities.The case is of a 21-year-old female presenting with right-sided hemiplegia and facial drooping. She had had an index presentation of throbbing headaches for the past 2 years, typical of a migraine but not preceded by any aura symptoms. However, in the current episode, the pain became excessively severe and accompanied by right-sided hemiplegia and facial drooping. A full investigation workup using MRI revealed evidence of infarct in the left temporoparietal and basal ganglion region.Our case highlights the need to evaluate silent ischemic stroke in case of prolonged headache with a history of migraine as well as the need for precaution to avoid the use of triptans or opioids in such a case. It also highlights the conditions that need to be excluded before labeling it as a migrainous infarct.", "doi": "10.1159/000481281", "title": "Case Report: Migrainous Infarct without Aura.", "journal": ["Case reports in neurology", "Case Rep Neurol"]}
