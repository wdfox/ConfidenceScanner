PAS was measured preoperatively, early post-implant, and at long-term follow-up (1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months post-implant). PAS was also measured at the occurrence of adverse events in patients who developed thrombotic complications. Data on patient demographics, medical history, antithrombotic therapy, and coagulation parameters were also analysed. Over a median follow-up of 602 (234-942) days, PAS values did not increase over time in the overall population (P = 0.15). However, PAS measured at event was 15-fold higher in the six patients (9%) who suffered pump thrombosis (n = 2) or ischaemic stroke (n = 4) vs. the rest of the population [6.67% (5.59%-11.98%) vs. 0.45% (0.33%-0.75%); P = 0.012], despite comparable coagulation profile. Pre-implant PAS values were 4.5-fold higher in these patients [1.90% (1.24%-3.17%) vs. 0.42% (0.32%-0.72%); P = 0.006]. Neither preoperative variables nor the type of the pump or the antiplatelet strategy were associated with a higher risk of complications.Thrombotic events are associated with altered PAS values. Moreover, baseline elevated PAS values in patients who developed thrombotic events suggest patient-specific tendency to post-implant thromboembolic complications. Prospectively, systematic monitoring of PAS might guide the development of refined patient-tailored antithrombotic strategies and the technological improvement of LVAD design.", "doi": "10.1002/ejhf.1113", "title": "Platelet activation is a preoperative risk factor for the development of thromboembolic complications in patients with continuous-flow left ventricular assist device.", "journal": ["European journal of heart failure", "Eur.
