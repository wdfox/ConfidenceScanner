Lariat procedure involves percutaneous catheter based epicardial ligation of the LAA with a suture via an endo-epicardial hybrid approach. It offers the advantage of not leaving behind a focus for thrombus formation or embolization. Similar to surgical ligation of the left atrial appendage, Lariat ligation is limited by leaks in a small percentage of patients. The incidence of leaks is variable and can be seen in the immediate post procedure period or during follow up. The electrical and mechanical implications of leaks are still under debate. In this review, we discuss the incidence, pathophysiology, clinical implications and methods of closure of leaks after Lariat. In the end, we present a case of a Lariat leak closed with an Amplatzer septal occluder.", "doi": "10.4022/jafib.1725", "title": "Leaks after left atrial appendage ligation with Lariat device: Incidence, pathophysiology, clinical implications and methods of closure- A case based discussion.", "journal": ["Journal of atrial fibrillation", "J Atr Fibrillation"]}
