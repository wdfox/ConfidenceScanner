After 20 years (mean follow up 97 \u00b1 82 months; range 1 to 369 months) no prosthesis-related major bleeding or thromboembolic events had been observed; the 20-year survival was 94 \u00b1 6% in the Bentall group, and 100% in the David group (p = 0.32). Freedom from reintervention for aortic valve dysfunction was 100% in the Bentall group, and 75 \u00b1 13% in the David group (p = 0.04). This inter-group difference became relevant after the first eight-year period of follow-up, and was mainly associated with a particular familiar genetic phenotype involving three out of four reoperated patients. Freedom from all-cause death, myocardial infarction, stroke, prosthetic valve-related complications, and reintervention on any aortic segment was 69 \u00b1 12% in the Bentall group, and 67 \u00b1 14% in the David group (p = 0.33).The Bentall and David operations are both associated with satisfactory long-term results in MFS patients. The low rate of valve prosthesis-related complications suggested that the Bentall operation would continue to be a standard surgical treatment. The reimplantation technique, adopted for less-dilated aortas, provides satisfactory freedom from reoperation. Careful attention should be paid to the reimplantation technique in patients affected by a serious familiar genetic phenotype.", "doi": null, "title": "Long-Term Results of Aortic Root Surgery in Marfan Syndrome Patients: A Single-Center Experience.", "journal": ["The Journal of heart valve disease", "J.
