Twenty-one procedures were elective and 3 were urgent. Eighteen bare metal stents (2 stents in one patient) and 7 covered stents were used. All procedures were effective (CoA gradient reduced < 20 mm Hg), despite 2 migrations of bare metal stents. Mean gradient was reduced from 50.6 \u00b115.3 to 6.8 \u00b16.5 mm Hg (p < 0.001) and mean lumen diameter of stenosed aorta increased from 5.5 \u00b12.5 to 14.9 \u00b15.2 mm (p < 0.001). One special case is discussed - a 49-year-old man with end staged heart failure and severe CoA, who underwent a rescue procedure with a bare metal stent. One serious complication - stroke of the central nervous system - was observed in a 53-year-old woman during covered stent implantation (symptoms resolved during rehabilitation process).Stent implantation of native coarctation of the aorta is also a safe procedure in the eldest patients and is associated with persistent relief of aortic obstruction.", "doi": "10.5114/aic.2017.71611", "title": "Native aortic coarctation stenting in patients \u2265 46 years old.", "journal": ["Postepy w kardiologii interwencyjnej = Advances in interventional cardiology", "Postepy Kardiol Interwencyjnej"]}
