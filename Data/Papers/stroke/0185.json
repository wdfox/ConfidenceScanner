Limited data is available regarding the performance of TAVI in patients with native aortic valve regurgitation (NAVR).Methods\u2004and\u2004Results:We performed a systematic review from 2002 to 2016. The primary outcome was device success as per VARC-2 criteria. Secondary endpoints included procedural complications, and 30-day and 1-year mortality rates. A total of 175 patients were included from 31 studies. Device success was reported in 86.3% of patients - with device failure driven by moderate aortic regurgitation (AR \u22653+) and/or need for a second device. Procedural complications were rare, with no procedural deaths, myocardial infarctions or annular ruptures reported. Procedural safety was acceptable with a low 30-day incidence of stroke (1.5%). The 30-day and 1-year overall mortality rates were 9.6% and 20.0% (cardiovascular death, 3.8% and 10.1%, respectively). Patients receiving 2nd-generation valves demonstrated similar safety profiles with greater device success compared with 1st-generation valves (96.2% vs. 78.4%). This was driven by the higher incidence of second-valve implantation (23.4% vs. 1.7%) and significant paravalvular leak (8.3% vs. 0.0%).TAVI demonstrates acceptable safety and efficacy in high-risk patients with severe NAVR. Second-generation valves may afford a similar safety profile with improved device success. Dedicated studies are needed to definitively establish the efficacy of TAVI in this population.", "doi": "10.1253/circj.CJ-17-0672", "title": "Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) for Native Aortic Valve Regurgitation\u3000- A Systematic Review.", "journal": ["Circulation journal : official journal of the Japanese Circulation Society", "Circ.
