We present a case of a 69-year-old male patient with a history of stroke, who developed ACS of the thigh after elective THA while using therapeutic low molecular weight heparin as bridging for regular oral anticoagulation. ACS pathogenesis, diagnostic tools, treatment and relevant literature are discussed. The patient's ACS was recognized in time and treated by operative decompression with fasciotomy of the anterior compartment. Follow-up did not show any neurological deficit or soft-tissue damage.", "doi": "10.5312/wjo.v8.i12.964", "title": "Acute compartment syndrome of the thigh following hip replacement by anterior approach in a patient using oral anticoagulants.", "journal": ["World journal of orthopedics", "World J Orthop"]}
