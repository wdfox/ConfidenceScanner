In this study, a cerebral infarction model of ischemia/reperfusion injury received electroacupuncture at GV26 (15 Hz and 1 mA, continuous wave [biphasic pulses], for 5 minutes). Electroacupuncture effectively promoted regional cerebral blood flow on the infarct and non-infarct sides, increased infarct lesions, lectin, and number of blood vessels, upregulated von Willebrand factor and cell proliferation marker Ki67 expression, and diminished neurological severity score. These findings confirm that electroacupuncture at GV26 promotes establishment of collateral circulation and angiogenesis, and improves neurological function.", "doi": "10.4103/1673-5374.221156", "title": "Electroacupuncture improves neurovascular unit reconstruction by promoting collateral circulation and angiogenesis.", "journal": ["Neural regeneration research", "Neural Regen Res"]}
