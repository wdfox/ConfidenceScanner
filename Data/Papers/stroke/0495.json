Altering the cellular response to excitotoxic insults by modulating the downstream effects of NMDAR activation represents a promising therapeutic approach. For example, \u03b17 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (\u03b17 nAChRs) signaling has been shown to be able to change NMDA-induced neurotoxicity in some models. However, both neuroprotective and neurotoxic effects have been reported. In this study, we examined the effect of co-activation of \u03b17 nAChRs on NMDA-mediated cell death in rat organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHSCs). Our results show that \u03b17 nAChR stimulation did not significantly influence NMDA-induced excitotoxic cell damage as measured by propidium iodide uptake. However, treatment of OHSCs with the \u03b17 nAChR agonist choline alone induced an increase in the propidium iodide signal. Both the \u03b17 nAChR antagonist methyllycaconitine (MLA) and the NMDAR antagonist (RS)-3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP) were able to block this effect in the dentate gyrus and hippocampal subfield CA3.", "doi": "10.1007/s12640-017-9854-2", "title": "Effects of \u03b17 Nicotinic Receptor Activation on Cell Survival in Rat Organotypic Hippocampal Slice Cultures.", "journal": ["Neurotoxicity research", "Neurotox Res"]}
