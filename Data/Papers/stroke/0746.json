This study explored the relationship between EPVS and poststroke depression (PSD).A total of 725 patients with acute ischemic stroke were recruited from the Stroke Unit of a university-affiliated hospital in Hong Kong. PSD was defined as a Geriatric Depression Scale score of \u2265 7 assessed at three months after stroke. The extent of EPVS in the basal ganglia (BG) and the centrum semiovale (CS) was assessed on axial T2 weighted magnetic resonance imaging using a validated scale. Patients' EPVS status was categorized as either mild or moderate to severe degree. The association between EPVS and PSD was examined with logistic regression.One hundred and fifty-three (21.1%) of the study sample had PSD three month after stroke. 55.6% of the study sample were classified as having a minor stroke. The median scores of CS- and BG-EPVS were 1 (1-2) and 1 (0-2), respectively. After adjusting for demographic, clinical and imaging characteristics in multivariate logistic regression analyses, the CS-EPVS continuous score remained an independent predictor of PSD [odds ratio (OR) = 1.27; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.03-1.57]. After dichotomized, moderate to severe CS-EPVS was independently associated with PSD with an OR of 1.68 (95%CI = 1.10-2.57).The diagnosis of PSD was based on GDS score rather than a standardized clinical examination. The study favored the patients with milder stroke.CS-EPVS were associated with PSD identified at three months after mild to moderate acute ischemic stroke.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jad.2017.11.080", "title": "Enlarged perivascular spaces in the centrum semiovale are associated with poststroke depression: A 3-month prospective study.", "journal": ["Journal of affective disorders", "J Affect Disord"]}
