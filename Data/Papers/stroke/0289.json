This study aimed to assess the prevalence of depression; its correlates, and predictors among patients with stroke in Jordan.A cross-sectional, descriptive correlation design was used among 198 patients with stroke admitted to 9 hospitals all over Jordan. Depression was assessed using the validated hospital depression subscale (HDS) of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale.Study patients (mean age 56.62 years [SD\u2009=\u200914.2], 53% were males) experienced high prevalence of depression (76%); of these, 51.6% were categorized as higher depression category (a case of depression; HDS\u2009=\u200911-21). Factors that correspondingly predicted higher depression categories were low level of education (odds ratio [OR]\u2009=\u20093.347, 95% confidence interval [CI]\u2009=\u20092.920-23.949, P\u2009<\u2009.001), having a preparatory level of education (OR\u2009=\u20098.363, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.24-9.034, P\u2009=\u2009.017), having comorbid chronic diseases (OR\u2009=\u2009.401, 95% CI\u2009=\u2009.190-.847), being a smoker (OR\u2009=\u20092.488, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.105-5.604, P\u2009=\u2009.028), patients who reported inability to perform daily activities by themselves (OR\u2009=\u20093.688, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.746-7.790, P\u2009=\u2009.001), and patients with comorbid dysphasia (OR\u2009=\u200912.884, 95% CI\u2009=\u20094.846-34.25, P\u2009<\u2009.001).Post-stroke depression is a significant health problem among Jordanian patients with stroke and warrants serious attention. Clinicians need to consider these important predictors when assessing and managing depression among patients at risk.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2017.11.027", "title": "Post-Stroke Depression in Jordan: Prevalence Correlates and Predictors.", "journal": ["Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association", "J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis"]}
