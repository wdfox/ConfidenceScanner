Recent methods used for localization of lacunar infarcts are affected by high inter-rater variability. We used a novel algorithm-driven method that provided quantitative assessment of the distance of the lacunar infarct from the origins of the lenticulostriate arteries.We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients who presented with lacunar infarcts between 2007 and 2011. Diffusion-weighted imaging and magnetic resonance angiography were used to manually mark the infarct lesion and the ipsilateral origins of lenticulostriate arteries. A 3-dimensional distance formula computed the distance between the infarct and the arterial region of interest. All distances were adjusted for brain volumes. Agreement testing using 2 blinded assessors was used to determine reproducibility of this method.One hundred and ten patients were included in our study, with a median age of 72 years (interquartile range 58-81); 67 (61%) were male and 33 (30%) had hypertension and other vascular risk factors including hypercholesterolemia 45 (41%), smoking 33 (30%), diabetes 24 (22%), ischemic heart disease 18 (16%), and atrial fibrillation 9 (8%). The agreement test for 33 patients demonstrated an intraclass correlation of .89 and Lin's correlation coefficient of .89 (95% confidence interval .816-.963). The median distance for the study cohort was 24.5\u2009mm, with shorter median distances of 13.7\u2009mm observed in patients with atrial fibrillation (P value\u2009<\u2009.005).Our study used a novel method to calculate a distance measurement, which has high inter-rater correlation.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2017.09.040", "title": "An Objective Measurement of Lacunar Infarct Location from the Middle Cerebral Artery Stem.", "journal": ["Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association", "J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis"]}
