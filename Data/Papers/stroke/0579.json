The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of AVR plus ascending aorta replacement (AAR) in patients with severe AS and a heavily calcified ascending aorta.From 2004 to 2014, a total of 32 patients with severe AS and extensive aortic calcification underwent concomitant first-time AVR and AAR (AVR + AAR). The mean patient age was 74\u00b17 (range, 59-87) years, and 7 (22%) patients were octogenarians. The mean logistic EuroSCORE was 21.4%\u00b119.0% (range, 3.3-68.2%). Arterial cannulae were placed at the ascending aorta (n=26, 81%), aortic arch (n=5, 16%), or axillary artery (n=1, 3%). The aorta was not clamped, and circulatory arrest was used in all patients. One-to-many (1:n) propensity score matching between the study population (AVR + AAR, n=29) and control group (isolated AVR for severe AS, n=433) was performed.There was no early mortality in the study population. Postoperative neurologic complications included a minor stroke, which resolved without sequelae at discharge, and a transient ischemic attack. The 5-year survival rate was 83%\u00b19%. In the propensity score-matched comparison, 5-year survival was not significantly different between groups; 81%\u00b110% in the AVR + AAR group vs. 87%\u00b12% in the isolated AVR group (P=0.950).Surgical AVR with AAR in AS patients with calcified ascending aortas led to acceptable early and late outcomes. Although the applications for TAVI are growing, a surgical approach may be an alternative option for relatively younger patients with severely calcified aorta.", "doi": "10.21037/jtd.2017.10.100", "title": "Replacement of calcified ascending aorta in patients undergoing aortic valve replacement.", "journal": ["Journal of thoracic disease", "J Thorac Dis"]}
