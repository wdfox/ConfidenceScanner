The study was approved by our centre's ethics committee.Our final sample included 124 patients; mean age was 71.30\u00b111.99 years. In the QoL study, the EuroQol-5D dimensions in which participants presented most problems were anxiety/depression (66.7%) and pain/discomfort (62.2%). We found significant inter-sex differences in the dimensions of mobility and usual activities (P=.016 and P=.005, respectively). Women also achieved substantially poorer EuroQoL-5D index values than men (0.45\u00b10.45 vs. 0.65\u00b10.38; P=.013). QoL was found to be associated with dependence for the activities of daily living (r=0.326; P=.001) and depressed mood (r=-0.514; P<.0001). According to the predictive model for the EQ-5D index, 72% of the score on QoL items is explained by functional status, dependence for the activities of daily living (basic and instrumental), and depressed mood. Being married, in contrast, seems to be a protective factor.Stroke survivors have poor long-term QoL; this is more marked in women than in men, especially in the dimensions of mobility and usual activities.", "doi": "10.1016/j.nrl.2017.10.002", "title": "Sex differences in long-term quality of life after stroke: Influence of mood and functional status.", "journal": ["Neurologia (Barcelona, Spain)", "Neurologia"]}
