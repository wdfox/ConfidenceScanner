This study aimed to evaluate the impact of admission estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) levels on short-term (1-month) and long-term (1-year) mortality in patients with acute ischemic stroke.From the Taiwan Stroke Registry data, we classified ischemic stroke patients, identified from April 2006 to December 2015, into 5 groups by eGFR at admission: \u2265 90, 60-89, 30-59, 15-29, and <15\u00a0mL/min/1.73\u00a0m2 or on dialysis. Risks of 1-month mortality and 1-year mortality after ischemic stroke were investigated by the eGFR level.Among 52,732 ischemic stroke patients, 1480 died within one month. The 1-month mortality rate was over 5-fold greater in patients with eGFR <15\u00a0mL/min/1.73\u00a0m2 or dialysis than in patients with eGFR \u226590\u00a0mL/min/1.73\u00a0m2 (2.88 versus 0.56 per 1000 person-days). The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1-month mortality increased from 1.31 (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.08-1.59) for patients with eGFR 60-89\u00a0mL/min/1.73\u00a0m2 to 2.33 (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.80-3.02) for patients with eGFR\u00a0<\u00a015\u00a0mL/min/1.73\u00a0m2 or on dialysis. 3226 patients died within one year. The adjusted HR of mortality increased from 1.38 (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.21-1.59) for patients with eGFR 60-89\u00a0mL/min/1.73\u00a0m2 to 2.60 (95% CI 2.18-3.10) for patients with eGFR\u00a0<\u00a015\u00a0mL/min/1.73\u00a0m2 or on dialysis, compared to patients with eGFR\u00a0\u2265\u00a090\u00a0mL/min/1.73\u00a0m2.After acute ischemic stroke, patients with reduced eGFR are at elevated risks of short-term and long-term deaths in a graded relationship.", "doi": "10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2017.11.029", "title": "Renal function is associated with 1-month and 1-year mortality in patients with ischemic stroke.", "journal": ["Atherosclerosis", "Atherosclerosis"]}
