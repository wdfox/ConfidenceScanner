The following parameters were examined at 6h and 24h after pMCAO: neurological deficit, infarct volume, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, cerebral microvessel structure, brain microcirculation (TPLSM imaging), vasoactive factors and adhesion molecules.TXL improved neurological deficits, reduced infarct volume, attenuated BBB disruption, protected cerebral microvessel\u00a0structure, increased cerebral capillary flow velocity and volume flux, and inhibited leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions at 6h or 24h after pMCAO. The therapeutic efficacy was exerted in a dose-dependent manner. Further study revealed that TXL (high dose) regulated the expression of PGI2, TXA2 and ET-1, and suppressed ICAM-1 and P-selectin.TXL alleviates cerebral microcirculatory disturbances against ischemic injury by modulating endothelial function and inhibiting leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions. These effects are associated with regulating the expression of PGI2, TXA2 and ET-1, and suppressing ICAM-1 and P-selectin expression. This article is protected by copyright.
