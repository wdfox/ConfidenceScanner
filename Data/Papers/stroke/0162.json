We aimed to investigate whether, compared to COCAB, OPCAB is associated with better operative outcomes in octogenarians by analyzing the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) databases 2003-2011.Of the 134,117 discharge records from 797 hospitals analyzed of patients aged \u226580 years undergoing first time isolated CABG from 2003 to 2011, 70.9% (n=95,057) had COCAB and the remaining 29.1% (n=39,060) received OPCAB. Hospital and patient-level covariates were used to adjust the effect of OPCAB on operative outcomes.COCAB and OPCAB were comparable in terms of operative mortality (5.5% vs. 5.2% respectively, P=0.30). However, rate of stroke was significantly lower in the OPCAB (2.4% vs. 1.8% respectively, P=0.004) and this result was confirmed after full adjustment (OR 0.72; 95% CI: 0.58-0.91; P=0.005). OPCAB was associated with lower risk of wound infection (OR 0.61; 95% CI: 0.47-0.78; P=0.0001) and atrial fibrillation (OR 0.88; 95% CI: 0.82-0.94; P=0.0004). No differences were observed in terms of bleeding, sepsis, need for tracheostomy and haemodialysis. OPCAB was associated with a marginal trend towards lower costs but did not reduce hospital-stay length.In the NIS 2003-2011, compared to COCAB, OPCAB was associated with lower risk of stroke and atrial fibrillation in octogenarians. OPCAB might represent a valid option to reduce procedure-specific morbidity in this high-risk subgroup, in particular in subjects at higher risk of cerebrovascular events.", "doi": "10.21037/jtd.2017.11.10", "title": "Off- vs. on-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery on hospital outcomes in 134,117 octogenarians.", "journal": ["Journal of thoracic disease", "J Thorac Dis"]}
