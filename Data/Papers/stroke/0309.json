Apart from stroke risk stratification and management of anticoagulation, physicians managing this group of patients also need to determine an optimal strategy in terms of rate or rhythm control. With new techniques of catheter ablation to maintain patients in sinus rhythm, patients with atrial fibrillation now have more options for treatment, on top of pharmacological methods. This paper aims to review the current evidence for rate and rhythm control in both general patients and subgroups of interest commonly encountered in clinical practices such as obesity, heart failure and thyroid disease.", "doi": null, "title": "Rate or Rhythm Control of Atrial Fibrillation - Pearls for the Internist.", "journal": ["Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore", "Ann.
