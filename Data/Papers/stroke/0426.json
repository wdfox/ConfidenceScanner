Pregnant women do not respond to the passive leg-raising maneuver secondary to mechanical obstruction of the inferior vena cava by the gravid uterus. Our objective was to evaluate if administration of a fluid bolus increases baseline stroke volume (SV) among healthy pregnant patients during the third trimester.\u2003Healthy pregnant women who underwent elective term cesarean sections were included. A noninvasive cardiac output monitor was used to measure hemodynamic variables at baseline and after administration of a 500-mL crystalloid bolus.\u2003Forty-five women were included in the study. Fluid administration was associated with a statistically significant increase in SV from a baseline value of 71\u2009\u00b1\u200911 to 90\u2009\u00b1\u200919 mL (95% confidence interval [CI]: 13.67-21.49; p\u2009<\u20090.01) and a significant decrease in maternal heart rate from a baseline of 87\u2009\u00b1\u20099 beats per minute to 83\u2009\u00b1\u20098 after the fluid bolus (95% CI: -6.81 to -2.78; p\u2009=\u20090.03). No changes in peripheral vascular resistances or any other measured hemodynamic parameters were noted with volume expansion.\u2003In healthy term pregnancy, the heart operates in the ascending portion of the Starling's curve, rendering it fluid responsive.", "doi": "10.1055/s-0037-1615788", "title": "Stroke Volume Recruitability during the Third Trimester of Pregnancy.", "journal": ["American journal of perinatology", "Am J Perinatol"]}
