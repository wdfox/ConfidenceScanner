Statin use varies and past studies suggest low rates of real-world goal attainment. This study describes LDL-C goal attainment among atherosclerotic CV disease (ASCVD) patients with various utilization patterns of moderate- or high-intensity statins in routine care.This retrospective cohort study used electronic medical records data from the QuintilesIMS\u00ae Disease Analyzer (>\u20092\u00a0million individuals annually) to identify ASCVD (coronary atherosclerosis, stable/unstable angina, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, aneurysm, peripheral artery disease) patients on moderate-/high-intensity statin in Germany. Proportion of patients with LDL-C\u2009<\u200970\u00a0mg/dL was determined using the lowest LDL-C value for each patient (index) in 2012, 2013, and 2014, while on statin. Treatment patterns were assessed for patients with at least 1\u00a0year of post-index follow-up. Results were stratified by year and treatment pattern [no change, switch, dose up-/down-titration, discontinuation (\u2265\u200990\u00a0day gap)].In >\u200914,000 patients assessed in each year (mean age 71 years, 35% female, 8-12% taking high-intensity statins), approximately 80% had LDL-C\u2009\u2265\u200970\u00a0mg/dL. Treatment patterns were assessed for most (88-93%) patients. Approximately 79-81% of patients made no change to statin regimens, 1% switched statins, 14-16% discontinued; 1% of moderate-intensity patients up-titrated, and 3% of all patients down-titrated. LDL-C goal attainment in these treatment pattern groups was 20, 16-24, 17, 11-14, and 17-19%, respectively.Majority of ASCVD patients had LDL-C\u2009\u2265\u200970\u00a0mg/dL while on moderate-/high-intensity statins. Despite low LDL-C goal attainment, few patients changed their treatment regimens.", "doi": "10.1007/s00392-017-1193-z", "title": "Treatment patterns and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goal attainment among patients receiving high- or moderate-intensity statins.", "journal": ["Clinical research in cardiology : official journal of the German Cardiac Society", "Clin Res Cardiol"]}
