A structured search of the literature was performed in the PubMed database up to September 26, 2016, using predetermined keywords. Epidemiologic studies evaluating the risk for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs; i.e., stroke, acute myocardial infarction [MI], heart failure, coronary heart disease) were included according to different rates of chocolate intake. The software ProMeta 3 was used to perform the meta-analysis. The systematic review identified 16 eligible studies. The majority of the studies showed a protective effect of chocolate intake compared with unexposed individuals. The overall risk ratio (effect size [ES]) of CVD for the highest versus the lowest category of chocolate consumption was 0.77 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71-0.84; P\u00a0=\u00a00.000) with a moderate heterogeneity. The risk related to subgroups of CVD and in particular, the risk for MI was further analyzed: ES\u00a0=\u00a00.78 (95% CI, 0.64-0.94; P\u00a0=\u00a00.009) without statistical heterogeneity (I2\u00a0=\u00a046.56%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.13). Moreover, the analysis performed based on sex found an ES\u00a0=\u00a00.85 (95% CI, 0.77-0.95; P\u00a0=\u00a00.003) for women, with a very low grade of heterogeneity (I2\u00a0=\u00a062.21%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.005). The results of the meta-analysis showed a potential protective effect of moderate consumption of chocolate on cardiovascular risk, especially for women, and against MI for both sexes.", "doi": "10.1016/j.nut.2017.09.006", "title": "Can chocolate consumption reduce cardio-cerebrovascular risk?
