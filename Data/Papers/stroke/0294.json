We revisited this issue.Subjects consisted of 30 prospectively-enrolled ALS patients on whom both needle EMG and RNS were conducted in the same trapezius muscle. Fasciculation potentials (FPs) were identified off-line from the restored 3-min signal. Firing rate of FPs (FR-FP) per minute was calculated from the total count of FPs of different origins. Correlations between FR-FP, decremental percentage (Decr%) and the amplitude of the initial compound muscle action potential (CMAPamp) in RNS were investigated.There was no correlation between FR-FP and Decr% (r\u202f=\u202f0.03) or between FR-FP and CMAPamp (r\u202f=\u202f0.04). A significant negative correlation was observed between CMAPamp and Decr% (r\u202f=\u202f-0.56, P\u202f<\u202f.005).FPs are not correlated with the decremental response in RNS.The underlying mechanism for FPs and decremental responses in ALS must be different and unrelated to each other.", "doi": "10.1016/j.clinph.2017.11.007", "title": "Fasciculation potentials and decremental responses in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.", "journal": ["Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "Clin Neurophysiol"]}
