A sample of 128 consecutive patients with acute stroke, admitted to Department of Neurology from April to October in 2016, completed the FOIS. The interrater reliability, criterion validity, discriminant validity, cross validation, and the sensitivity of FOIS scale were evaluated. Results showed that rater agreements were excellent for FOIS (Kw = 0.881, p &lt; 0.001). A highly negative correlation between FOIS and WST (water swallow test) was detected (r = -0.937, p &lt; 0.001). There was significant difference for FOIS level of patients with different evaluation outcomes (\u03c7<sup>2</sup> = 126.551, p &lt; 0.001). The FOIS evaluation results were significantly correlated with two physiological measures of swallowing. The Chinese version of the FOIS score is a reliable scale for evaluating the level of oral feeding function in patients with acute stroke.", "doi": null, "title": "Validation of the Chinese Version of the Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS) Score in the Assessment of Acute Stroke Patients with Dysphagia.", "journal": ["Studies in health technology and informatics", "Stud Health Technol Inform"]}
