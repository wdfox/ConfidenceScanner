Limb dystonias vary more widely in the pattern of dystonic movement and involved muscles than cervical dystonia or blepharospasm. The large variation in how healthy individuals perform skilled hand movements, the large number of muscles in the hand and forearm, and the presence of compensatory actions in patients with dystonia add to the complexity of choosing muscles for injection. In this article, we discuss approaches to selecting upper and lower extremity muscles for chemodenervation treatment of limb dystonia.", "doi": "10.3390/toxins10010020", "title": "Muscle Selection for Focal Limb Dystonia.", "journal": ["Toxins", "Toxins (Basel)"]}
