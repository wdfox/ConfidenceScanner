The mean age of the patients was 44.7\u2009\u00b1\u200917.4 years and the majority (60%) were men. Haematological and biochemical laboratory abnormalities included anaemia (97.1%), leucocytosis (54.3%), hyperkalaemia (68.6%), severe metabolic acidosis (51.4%), hepatic dysfunction (74.3%), haemolysis (91.4%) and rhabdomyolysis (62.9%). The main complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and encephalopathy in four (11.4%) patients each; gastrointestinal bleeding, hypertension and panniculitis in two (5.7%) patients each and one (2.9%) patient each developed intra-abdominal bleeding, stroke and polyserositis. Twenty-nine (83%) patients required dialysis. Ten (29%) patients died. A higher white blood cell count (P\u2009=\u20090.05) and the complications of ARDS (P\u2009=\u20090.004) and encephalopathy (P\u2009=\u20090.004) were associated with mortality. The kidney functions normalized at 5.5\u2009\u00b1\u20092.6 weeks in patients who survived. Kidney biopsy was done in 13 patients. The predominant lesion was acute tubular necrosis (ATN) with or without pigmented granular cast in 10 (77%) patients. In four (30.8%) patients, the kidney biopsy showed severe ATN and in the other six (46.2%), the kidney biopsy showed features of ATN associated with mild to moderate acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). In three (23%) patients the histopathological examination revealed only moderate AIN and these patients were treated with a short course of steroids.AKI due to multiple Hymenoptera stings is severe and is associated with high mortality. On renal histology, ATN and AIN are common.", "doi": "10.1093/ckj/sfx010", "title": "Acute kidney injury due to multiple Hymenoptera stings-a clinicopathological study.", "journal": ["Clinical kidney journal", "Clin Kidney J"]}
