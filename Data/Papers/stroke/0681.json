This report illustrates a case of MELAS syndrome with hypothyroidism and psychiatric disorders, which is different from the common clinical manifestations of MELAS syndrome, such as exercise intolerance, migraine-like headaches, hearing loss and seizures etc. There are considerable interests in the possibility that mitochondrial dysfunction may play a role in the pathogenesis of endocrine dysfunctions and psychiatric disorders in MELAS syndrome.", "doi": "10.1016/j.ensci.2016.11.005", "title": "Adult-onset of mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome with hypothyroidism and psychiatric disorders.", "journal": ["eNeurologicalSci", "eNeurologicalSci"]}
