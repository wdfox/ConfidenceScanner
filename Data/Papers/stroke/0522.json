There is evidence to suggest LVOT ellipticity and recommend 3D LVOT area (LVOTCSA ) adoption in aortic stenosis. We sought to evaluate if the same concept applies to supra-annular aortic prosthesis comparing SV and EOA derived from LVOTD (EOAD ) and from LVOTCSA (EOACSA ). EOA computed from SVV (EAOV ) accuracy was evaluated in this setting. Patient-prosthesis mismatch (PPM) was compared among different EOA computations.A consecutive series of 202 patients (aged 81\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0years, 43% males) underwent St.Jude Trifecta aortic valve replacement (AVR) and were followed up with echocardiography at one-year (335\u00a0\u00b1\u00a031\u00a0days). All measurements followed the EACVI or ASE guidelines, 3D X-plane modality was used to compute SVv and measure LVOTCSA ; SV was calculated from LVOTD (SVD ) and LVOTCSA (SVCSA ). PPM was indexed EOA <0.65\u00a0cm\u00b2/m\u00b2.LVOT showed a significant ellipticity index (1.17\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0.27), independent of prosthesis size. EOAD (1.70\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.55\u00a0cm\u00b2) was less than EOACSA (1.95\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.62\u00a0cm\u00b2) (P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001). SVV was significantly lower than SVD and SVCSA . Bland-Altman analysis showed a significant correlation between SVV and SVD or SVCSA although with large bias and imprecision. The correlations improved reducing bias and imprecision when LVOT time-velocity integral was <20\u00a0cm. PPM incidence was higher in EOAV (15.6%) compared to EOAD (P\u00a0=\u00a0.04) or EOACSA (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001).In supra-annular AVR, LVOT retains its elliptical shape and LVOTCSA yielded larger prosthesis EOA with lower PPM incidence. PPM may be overestimated by EOAV .", "doi": "10.1111/echo.13778", "title": "Left ventricular outflow tract shape after aortic valve replacement with St. Jude Trifecta prosthesis.", "journal": ["Echocardiography (Mount Kisco, N.Y.)", "Echocardiography"]}
