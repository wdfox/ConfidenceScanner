However, the limitations of this method are often neglected or overlooked. One of the prerequisites for PPV and SVV evaluation, in addition to intermittent positive pressure ventilation, is a \"regular heart rhythm,\" which may be an ambiguous term. We present a case where, despite a regular (paced) rhythm, atrioventricular dissociation was present and resulted in marked PPV elevation, which subsequently disappeared once sinus rhythm returned. Our case indicates that PPV and SVV should be interpreted with caution when atrioventricular dissociation is present.", "doi": "10.1155/2017/7647069", "title": "Cyclic Nonrespiratory Pulse Pressure Oscillations Caused by Atrioventricular Dissociation.", "journal": ["Case reports in critical care", "Case Rep Crit Care"]}
