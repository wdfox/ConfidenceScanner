HRQoL was assessed using the EuroQol five-dimension questionnaire (EQ-5D).Stroke survivors with dementia were 5.60\u00a0times more likely to have mobility problems, 12.20\u00a0times to have self-care problems, 16.61\u00a0times to have problems in usual activities, 4.31\u00a0times to have pain/discomfort, and 3.28\u00a0times to have anxiety/depression than stroke survivors with normal cognitive function. Stroke survivors with mild cognitive dysfunction (MCD) were 2.57\u00a0times more likely to have mobility problems, 3.17\u00a0times to have self-care problems, 3.31\u00a0times to have problems in usual activities, 2.11\u00a0times to have pain/discomfort, and 2.35\u00a0times to have anxiety/depression than those with normal cognitive function. Both dementia (b = -15.13, p < .001) and MCD (b = -6.24, p < .001) significantly contributed to lower EQ-5D VAS; both dementia (b = -.15, p < .001) and MCD (b = -.10, p < .001) significantly contributed to lower EQ-5D index.Dementia and MCD strongly predicted worse overall and specific HRQoL dimensions, especially self-care and usual activities for older stroke survivors.", "doi": "10.1080/13607863.2017.1414148", "title": "Cognitive dysfunction predicts worse health-related quality of life for older stroke survivors: a nationwide population-based survey in Taiwan.", "journal": ["Aging & mental health", "Aging Ment Health"]}
