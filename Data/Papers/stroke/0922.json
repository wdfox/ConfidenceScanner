Until now, there have not been any reported cases of an acute ischaemic event (stroke) as the result of a HBOT-associated oxygen toxicity seizure. We report an event in which a seizure and stroke occurred together and consider that the stroke may have been caused by seizure-induced demand ischaemia. This challenges the generally held view that oxygen toxicity seizures in the clinical hyperbaric setting are benign. A discussion of the literature on the subject of seizure-induced brain injury is included. Risk factors for cerebrovascular disease should be taken into consideration in determining treatment pressures for HBOT, as reducing pressure reduces seizure risk.", "doi": null, "title": "Hyperbaric oxygen-associated seizure leading to stroke.", "journal": ["Diving and hyperbaric medicine", "Diving Hyperb Med"]}
