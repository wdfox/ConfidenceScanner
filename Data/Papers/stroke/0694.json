In this study, we mainly studied the role of lncRNA-RMST in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-induced mouse brain injury. We showed that RMST expression level was significantly up-regulated in oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-treated primary hippocampal neuron, MCAO-induced injured brain, and the plasma of patients with ischemic stroke. RMST silencing protected against MCAO-induced ischemic brain injury in\u00a0vivo and OGD-induced primary hippocampal neuron injury in\u00a0vitro. Intracerebroventricular injection of RMST shRNA significantly decreased brain RMST expression, reduced brain infarct size, and improved neurological function. Collectively, this study provides evidence that lncRNA is involved in the pathogenesis of ischemic brain injury, and suggests a promising approach of RMST inhibition in treating ischemic stroke.", "doi": "10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.12.087", "title": "Long non-coding RNA RMST silencing protects against middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-induced ischemic stroke.", "journal": ["Biochemical and biophysical research communications", "Biochem.
