It is unknown whether anosognosia of neglect varies for different types of daily activities. The objective is to examine the frequency of anosognosia of neglect for items on the Catherine Bergego Scale (CBS) and to determine the level of agreement between participant/assessor item ratings and total scores. Secondary analysis of data was carried out. We conducted descriptive analyses and interrater reliability analyses (Cohen's kappa) to determine the level of agreement between assessor and participant item ratings. A paired t test was conducted to compare assessor and participant total scores. The frequency of anosognosia among items varied (29.2%-83.3%) and Kappa statistics ranged from -0.07 (no agreement) to 0.23 (fair agreement) for item ratings. There was a significant difference- t(36) = 3.02, p \u2264 .01)-between assessor ( M = 8.0, SD = 5.2) and participant-rated ( M = 5.3, SD = 4.5) total CBS scores. Anosognosia is prevalent among those with neglect. Findings highlight the importance of assessing for anosognosia.", "doi": "10.1177/1539449217747586", "title": "Examining Anosognosia of Neglect.", "journal": ["OTJR : occupation, participation and health", "OTJR (Thorofare N J)"]}
