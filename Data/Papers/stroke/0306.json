The non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) fibrosis score (NFS) has been developed to identify liver fibrosis in patients with NAFLD. It remains to be determined whether NFS is associated with cardiovascular prognosis in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). We calculated NFS in 516 patients with CHF admitted to our hospital. The clinical endpoints were deaths due to progressive HF, myocardial infarction, stroke, and sudden cardiac death, and rehospitalization for worsening HF. There were 173 cardiovascular events noted during a median follow-up of 464\u00a0days. Patients with cardiovascular events showed a higher NFS as compared with those without. We divided the patients into four groups according to quartiles of NFS. The proportion of New York Heart Association functional class III/IV and serum brain natriuretic peptide levels were increased with increasing NFS. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that cardiovascular event rate was increased with increasing NFS in patients with CHF. In multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, NFS was independently associated with cardiovascular events after adjustment for confounding factors. Elevated NFS was associated with unfavorable outcomes in patients with CHF. Liver fibrosis assessed by NFS may provide valuable prognostic information in patients with CHF.", "doi": "10.1007/s00380-017-1113-1", "title": "The impact of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis score on cardiac prognosis in patients with chronic heart failure.", "journal": ["Heart and vessels", "Heart Vessels"]}
