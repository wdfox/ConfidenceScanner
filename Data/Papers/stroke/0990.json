Patients were followed for a mean of 45.5\u2009\u00b1\u200926.5 months (range 3-96 months).All patients successfully underwent the one-stage procedure. No early deaths were recorded. The mean aortic cross-clamp and cardiopulmonary bypass times were 71\u2009\u00b1\u200923 and 113\u2009\u00b1\u200937\u2009mins, respectively. Re-exploration for bleeding was performed on one patient (3.6%). The average post-operative hospital stay was 15.9\u2009\u00b1\u20094.9 days and the average operation time was 5.2\u2009h. No paraplegia or stroke was observed. The blood pressure gradient of the upper and lower extremities significantly decreased (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Systolic blood pressure decreased from 158\u2009\u00b1\u200936\u2009mmHg pre-operatively to 121\u2009\u00b1\u200918\u2009mmHg post-operatively. No deaths or significant gradients between the upper and lower extremities occurred during follow-up. No death and complications of bypass grafts occurred during follow-up.Ascending-to-abdominal aortic bypass and concomitant aortic valve procedures are a suitable therapeutic option for severe aortic coarctation combined with aortic valve pathology in adult patients.", "doi": "10.1111/jocs.13505", "title": "One-stage ascending-to-abdominal aortic bypass with concomitant aortic valve procedures for aortic coarctation combined with aortic valve pathology in adult patients.", "journal": ["Journal of cardiac surgery", "J Card Surg"]}
