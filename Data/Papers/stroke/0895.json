Design Prospective analysis on 17,102 men and women (mean age 53\u2009\u00b1\u200911) free from cardiovascular disease at time of enrolment in the Moli-sani cohort (2005-2010). Methods HRQL was assessed by the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey. Hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated using multivariable Cox-proportional hazard models. Results At the end of follow-up (median 4.2 years), 237 new events occurred (coronary heart disease n\u2009=\u2009197, cerebrovascular disease n\u2009=\u200942). In a multivariable model adjusted for socioeconomic factors, chronic disease and health-related behaviours, both mental and physical HRQL were inversely associated with the risk of the composite outcome (hazard ratio\u2009=\u20090.57; 0.39-0.84 and hazard ratio\u2009=\u20090.62; 0.40-0.94, respectively; highest vs. lowest quartile). Further adjustment for C-reactive protein marginally modified the association with physical HRQL (hazard ratio\u2009=\u20090.67; 0.43-1.02). Similar findings were obtained when only CHD events were analysed (hazard ratio\u2009=\u20090.63; 0.41-0.96 for highest versus lowest mental HRQL) although results with physical HRQL were no longer significant (hazard ratio\u2009=\u20090.65; 0.40-1.04 for highest versus lowest quartile). Associations with incident cerebrovascular disease showed a trend toward protection (hazard ratio\u2009=\u20090.50; 0.22-1.17 and hazard ratio\u2009=\u20090.51; 0.22-1.23 for highest versus lowest tertile of mental and physical HRQL, respectively). Conclusions HRQL is an independent predictor of composite CHD/cerebrovascular outcomes in an adult population. The magnitude of the association was not affected either by socioeconomic factors, health conditions or health-related behaviours. Improvement of quality of life may be a major factor in targeting appropriate prevention strategies for cardiovascular health.", "doi": "10.1177/2047487317748452", "title": "Health-related quality of life and risk of composite coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular events in the Moli-sani study cohort.", "journal": ["European journal of preventive cardiology", "Eur J Prev Cardiol"]}
