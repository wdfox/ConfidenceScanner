Neuroprotective pharmacological modalities are urgently needed to address this burgeoning population. Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) conjugation has been established as an endogenous neuroprotective response, and we have discovered several classes of small molecules that enhance SUMO conjugation. Herein we describe the hit to lead campaign that enabled the discovery of 3 diverse classes of drug-like SUMOylation activators. Optimized compounds were ultimately validated in cell-based models of neuronal loss and provide a foundation for establishing systemically active SUMO activators to treat degenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and stroke.", "doi": "10.1016/j.bmcl.2017.12.028", "title": "Small molecule SUMOylation activators are novel neuroprotective agents.", "journal": ["Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters", "Bioorg.
