Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) can be a manifestation of central nervous system (CNS) involvement in these diseases. Furthermore, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a potential complication of these necrotizing vasculitides. We describe a case of AAV who presented with acute ischemic stroke and developed multiple ICHs after administration of IV tPA. We propose that patients with AAV are more prone to develop hemorrhage in the presence of IV tPA and discuss the possible underlying pathogenesis. We suggest that AAV should be considered a contraindication for administration of IV tPA.", "doi": "10.1016/j.ensci.2017.08.004", "title": "Intracerebral hemorrhage after IV tPA for stroke as early symptom of ANCA-associated vasculitis.", "journal": ["eNeurologicalSci", "eNeurologicalSci"]}
