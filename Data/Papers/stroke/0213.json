All the cases in the active stage underwent glucocorticoid therapy. Four cases developed complications, including cardiac dysfunction combined with preeclampsia in two cases, preeclampsia in one case, and stroke in one case. Eleven patients successfully delivered (nine cases of full-term delivery and two cases of premature delivery); one patient had late miscarriage; one patient had missed abortion. All the parturients survived and delivered 11 neonates (nine full-term neonates and two premature neonates) and one low-birth-weight neonate; no neonatal asphyxia or death occurred.Patients with P-TA can have better maternal and child outcomes through timely diagnosis and treatment, dynamic monitoring, or timely pregnancy termination.", "doi": "10.5603/GP.a2017.0117", "title": "Clinical analysis: 13 cases of pregnancy complicated with Takayasu arteritis.", "journal": ["Ginekologia polska", "Ginekol.
