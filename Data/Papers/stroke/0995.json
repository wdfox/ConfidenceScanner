The risk of suffering a\u00a0thromboembolic complication depends on the accompanying cardiac risk factors and the patient's age. For patients who have an increased risk, which is now classified using the CHA2DS2-VASc score, initiation of long-term oral anticoagulation is the first-line treatment. In AF, thrombi arise in the left atrial appendage. The present review will summarize the basic pathophysiology of thrombogenesis in AF and will provide the molecular basis of a\u00a0process called prothrombotic endocardial remodeling. Despite oral anticoagulation being a central component of therapy, the present results can be used to support concomitant therapy with statins, angiotensin\u00a0II blockers, etc. to inhibit atrial thromogenesis.", "doi": "10.1007/s00399-017-0543-x", "title": "Atrial thrombogenesis in atrial fibrillation : Results from atrial fibrillation models and AF-patients.", "journal": ["Herzschrittmachertherapie & Elektrophysiologie", "Herzschrittmacherther Elektrophysiol"]}
