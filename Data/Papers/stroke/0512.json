Techniques involved commissural figure-of-8 suspension sutures (n\u00a0= 63 [6.2%]), cusp repair with commissuroplasty (n\u00a0=\u00a0481 [48%]), debridement (n\u00a0= 174 [17%]), free-margin plication (n\u00a0= 271 [27%]) or resection (n\u00a0= 75) or both, or annulus repair with resuspension (n\u00a0= 230 [23%]), root\u00a0reimplantation (n\u00a0= 252 [25%]), or remodeling (n\u00a0=\u00a035\u00a0[3.5%]).Planned repair was aborted for replacement in 115 patients (10%); risk factors included greater severity of aortic regurgitation (AR; p\u00a0= 0.0002) and valve calcification (p < 0.0001). In-hospital outcomes for the remaining 1,009 patients included death (12 [1.2%]), stroke (13 [1.3%]), and reoperation for valve dysfunction (14 [1.4%]). Freedom from aortic valve reoperation at 1, 5, and 10 years was 97%, 93%, and 90%, respectively. Figure-of-8 suspension sutures, valve resuspension, and root repair and replacement were least likely to require reoperation; cusp repair with commissural sutures, plication, and commissuroplasty was most likely (p < 0.05). Survival at 1, 5, and 10 years was 96%, 92%, and 83%. Immediate postoperative AR grade was none-mild (94%), moderate (5%), and severe (1%). At 10 years after repair, AR grade was none (20%), mild (33%), moderate (26%), and severe (21%). Patients undergoing root procedures were less likely to have higher-grade postoperative AR (p < 0.0001).Valve repair is effective and durable for treating aortic valve dysfunction. Greater severity of AR preoperatively is associated with higher likelihood of repair failure. Commissural figure-of-8 suspension sutures and repair with annular support have the best long-term durability.", "doi": "10.1016/j.athoracsur.2017.09.019", "title": "Durability of Aortic Valve Cusp Repair With and Without Annular Support.", "journal": ["The Annals of thoracic surgery", "Ann.
