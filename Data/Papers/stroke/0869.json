We aimed to characterise these processes during routine CABG surgery to inform the diagnosis of type 5 myocardial infarction.We assessed 87 patients with stable coronary artery disease who underwent elective CABG surgery. Myocardial inflammation, injury and infarction were assessed using plasma inflammatory biomarkers, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) using both late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and ultrasmall superparamagnetic particles of iron oxide (USPIO).Systemic humoral inflammatory biomarkers (myeloperoxidase, interleukin-6, interleukin-8 and c-reactive protein) increased in the post-operative period with C-reactive protein concentrations plateauing by 48\u00a0h (median area under the curve (AUC) 7530 [interquartile range (IQR) 6088 to 9027] mg/L/48\u00a0h). USPIO-defined cellular myocardial inflammation ranged from normal to those associated with type 1 myocardial infarction (median 80.2 [IQR 67.4 to 104.8] /s). Plasma hs-cTnI concentrations rose by \u226550-fold from baseline and exceeded 10-fold the upper limit of normal in all patients. Two distinct patterns of peak cTnI release were observed at 6 and 24\u00a0h. After CABG surgery, new LGE was seen in 20% (n\u2009=\u200918) of patients although clinical peri-operative type 5 myocardial infarction was diagnosed in only 9% (n\u2009=\u20098). LGE was associated with the delayed 24-h peak in hs-cTnI and its magnitude correlated with AUC plasma hs-cTnI concentrations (r\u2009=\u20090.33, p\u2009<\u20090.01) but not systemic inflammation, myocardial inflammation or bypass time.Patients undergoing CABG surgery invariably have plasma hs-cTnI concentrations >10-fold the 99th centile upper limit of normal that is not attributable to inflammatory or ischemic injury alone. Peri-operative type 5 myocardial infarction is often unrecognised and is associated with a delayed 24-h peak in plasma hs-cTnI concentrations.", "doi": "10.1186/s13019-017-0681-6", "title": "Myocardial inflammation, injury and infarction during on-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery.", "journal": ["Journal of cardiothoracic surgery", "J Cardiothorac Surg"]}
