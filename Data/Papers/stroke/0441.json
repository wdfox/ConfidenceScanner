Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi's) suppress angiotensin II (ANG II) concentrations, whereas angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor blockers (ARBs) block the binding of ANG II to AT1 receptors. ACEi's and ARBs are both effective antihypertensive agents and produce similar risk reductions for stroke, a blood pressure-dependent phenomenon. ACEi's also reduce the risk for myocardial infarction (MI) and all-cause mortality in high-risk hypertensive patients as well as in people with diabetes, vascular disease and congestive heart failure. ARBs, in contrast, do not reduce the risk for MI or death in randomized clinical trials when assessed vs. placebo. Systematic reviews of ARBs that include meta-analyses or metaregression analyses confirm that ARBs lack the cardiovascular-protective effects of ACEi's. Practice guidelines, especially those for high-risk patients, such as those with diabetes mellitus, should reflect the evidence that ACEi's and ARBs have divergent cardiovascular effects: ACEi's reduce mortality, whereas ARBs do not. ACEi's should remain the preferred RAAS inhibitor for patients at high risk.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jcjd.2017.09.011", "title": "The Divergent Cardiovascular Effects of ACE Inhibitors and ARBs in Patient With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.", "journal": ["Canadian journal of diabetes", "Can J Diabetes"]}
