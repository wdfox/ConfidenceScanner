It has been anecdotally noted that depressive symptoms do not limit motor recovery in patients who undergo Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT), an efficacious intervention for chronic poststroke hemiparesis. Here we analyze depressive symptom and motor scores from 40 participants who received CIMT in 2 previously published studies.Adults more than 1-year after stroke with mild to moderate upper-extremity hemiparesis completed the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale and Motor Activity Log (MAL) before and after CIMT. We used regression analysis to test whether Zung scores predicted response to CIMT and paired t tests to test whether depressive symptoms changed from pre- to posttreatment.Pretreatment Zung score did not predict outcome on the MAL Arm Use scale, \u0394R2 (1, 30) = 0.004, p = .19, after controlling for pretreatment MAL scores. Additionally, participants had a small but statistically significant decrease in Zung score, t(39) = 3.0, p = .005, mean change = -3.6.These results suggest that depressive symptoms do not significantly limit motor recovery in patients treated with CIMT for chronic poststroke hemiparesis. Additionally, treatment with CIMT may improve depressive symptoms.
