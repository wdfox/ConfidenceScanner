Increasing efforts have focused on pharmacological hypothermia as a treatment option for stroke. Previously, we showed that activation of a thermoregulatory ion channel, transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), by dihydrocapsaicin (DHC) produces reliable hypothermia. In this study, we investigate the effects of TRPV1-mediated hypothermia by DHC on long-term ischemic stroke injury and functional outcome. Hypothermia initiated at 3.5\u2009hours after stroke significantly reduced primary cortical injury. Interestingly, hypothermia by DHC also significantly reduced secondary thalamic injury, as DHC-treated stroke mice exhibited 53% smaller thalamic lesion size. DHC-treated stroke mice further demonstrated decreased neuronal loss and astrogliosis in the thalamus and less thalamic fiber loss by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Importantly, a single 8\u2009hour treatment of hypothermia by DHC after stroke provided long-term improvement in functional outcome, as DHC-treated mice exhibited improved behavioral recovery at one month post-stroke. These findings indicate that TRPV1-mediated hypothermia is effective in reducing both primary cortical injury and remote secondary thalamic injury, and a single treatment can produce persistent effects on functional recovery. These data highlight the therapeutic potential for TRPV1 agonism for stroke treatment.", "doi": "10.1038/s41598-017-17548-y", "title": "TRPV1-mediated Pharmacological Hypothermia Promotes Improved Functional Recovery Following Ischemic Stroke.", "journal": ["Scientific reports", "Sci Rep"]}
