We addressed their diagnostic and prognostic role in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and transient ischemic attack (TIA).Nested within a prospective cohort study, we compared levels of serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) drawn within 24 h from symptom onset in patients with AIS or TIA. Patients without magnetic resonance imaging on admission were excluded. We assessed whether sNfL was associated with: (i) clinical severity on admission, (ii) diagnosis of AIS vs. TIA, (iii) infarct size on admission magnetic resonance diffusion-weighted imaging (MR-DWI) and (iv) functional outcome at 3 months.We analyzed 504 patients with AIS and 111 patients with TIA. On admission, higher National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores were associated with higher sNfL: NIHSS score < 7, 13.1 pg/mL [interquartile range (IQR), 5.3-27.8]; NIHSS score 7-15, 16.7 pg/mL (IQR, 7.4-34.9); and NIHSS score > 15, 21.0 pg/mL (IQR, 9.3-40.4) (P = 0.01). Compared with AIS, patients with TIA had lower sNfL levels [9.0 pg/mL (95% confidence interval, 4.0-19.0) vs. 16.0 pg/mL (95% confidence interval, 7.3-34.4), P < 0.001], also after adjusting for age and NIHSS score (P = 0.006). Among patients with AIS, infarct size on admission MR-DWI was not associated with sNfL, either in univariate analysis (P = 0.15) or after adjusting for age and NIHSS score on admission (P = 0.56). Functional outcome 3 months after stroke was not associated with sNfL after adjusting for established predictors.In conclusion, among patients admitted within 24 h of AIS or TIA onset, admission sNfL levels were associated with clinical severity on admission and TIA diagnosis, but not with infarct size on MR-DWI acquired on admission or functional outcome at 3 months.", "doi": "10.1111/ene.13554", "title": "Serum neurofilament light chain in patients with acute cerebrovascular events.", "journal": ["European journal of neurology", "Eur.
