Only 5 PAPS patients who underwent PCI and stenting were found, and they were compared with 15 non-antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) patients. A history of MI and stroke was noticeable in PAPS patients despite a lower frequency of traditional cardiovascular risk factors than in control subjects. The occurrence of MACEs both in the hospital and in the long term was similar between groups, and no deaths were registered during follow-up. Although the median time to present MACEs was shorter in PAPS patients (29 vs. 84 months), and the hazard ratio was above the unit, its 95% confidence interval encompassed the unit (hazard ratio, 1.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.22-10.04; P = 0.60), and thus, it was not significant. Primary antiphospholipid syndrome does not seem to increase the incidence of MACEs after PCI and stenting in patients with MI.", "doi": "10.1097/RHU.0000000000000651", "title": "The Impact of Primary Antiphospholipid Syndrome on Long-term Cardiovascular Outcomes After Percutaneous Coronary Intervention and Stenting in Patients With Myocardial Infarction.", "journal": ["Journal of clinical rheumatology : practical reports on rheumatic & musculoskeletal diseases", "J Clin Rheumatol"]}
