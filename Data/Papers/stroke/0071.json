External carotid artery (ECA) thrombosis is observed during CAS follow-up, but it often remains asymptomatic or, at worst, results in jaw claudication. We report here a case of late occlusion of the ECA after CAS with symptoms of acute homolateral facial ischemia as well as pain, cyanosis, tongue numbness, and skin coldness. The patient was submitted to local thrombolysis and balloon angioplasty with regression of symptoms after recanalization. With this report, we add a caveat about blockage of the ECA ostium during CAS.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jvscit.2016.12.004", "title": "Acute hemifacial ischemia as a late complication of carotid stenting.", "journal": ["Journal of vascular surgery cases and innovative techniques", "J Vasc Surg Cases Innov Tech"]}
