Transient changes are not usually expected to be present in postictal MRI studies because of their rarity. Here, we present a unique case of peri-ictal MRI findings located in the occipital lobe, present in a 34-year-old female with recurrent occipital seizures occurring twice in four years. MRI changes completely resolved after both episodes with no residual focal damage. The peri-ictal occipital changes on MRI in this patient are unique because they have been captured on more than one occasion. Peri-ictal MRI findings are a known phenomenon with unknown pathophysiology, although attempts have been made to understand these findings. Though the MRI findings and presentation appear to be stroke-like or PRES-like, seizures should be kept in the differential for better treatment outcomes.", "doi": "10.1155/2017/6061879", "title": "Recurrent Occipital Seizures with Transient MRI Changes.", "journal": ["Case reports in neurological medicine", "Case Rep Neurol Med"]}
