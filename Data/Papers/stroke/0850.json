We investigated which procedural processes during cryoballoon procedures carried a risk.Forty paroxysmal atrial fibrillation patients underwent pulmonary vein isolation using second-generation cryoballoons with single 28-mm balloon 3-minute freeze techniques. Microembolic signals (MESs) were monitored by transcranial Doppler throughout all procedures. Brain magnetic resonance imaging was obtained pre- and post-procedure in 34 patients (85.0%). Of 158 pulmonary veins, 152 (96.2%) were isolated using cryoablation, and 6 required touch-up radiofrequency ablation. A mean of 5.0\u00b11.2 cryoballoon applications was applied, and the left atrial dwell time was 76.7\u00b122.4 minutes. The total MES counts/procedures were 522 (426-626). Left atrial access and Flexcath sheath insertion generated 25 (11-44) and 34 (24-53) MESs. Using radiofrequency ablation for transseptal access increased the MES count during transseptal punctures. During cryoapplications, MES counts were greatest during first applications (117 [81-157]), especially after balloon stretch/deflations (43 [21-81]). Pre- and post-pulmonary vein potential mapping with Lasso catheters generated 57 (21-88) and 61 (36-88) MESs. Reinsertion of once withdrawn cryoballoons and subsequent applications produced 205 (156-310) MESs. Touch-up ablation generated 32 (19-62) MESs, whereas electric cardioversion generated no MESs. SCEs and silent cerebral lesions were detected in 11 (32.3%) and 4 (11.7%) patients, respectively. The patients with SCEs were older than those without; however, there were no significant factors associated with SCEs.A significant number of MESs and SCE/silent cerebral lesion occurrences were observed during second-generation cryoballoon ablation procedures. MESs were recorded during a variety of steps throughout the procedure; however, the majority occurred during phases with a high probability of gaseous emboli.", "doi": "10.1161/CIRCEP.117.005612", "title": "Thromboembolic Risks of the Procedural Process in Second-Generation Cryoballoon Ablation Procedures: Analysis From Real-Time Transcranial Doppler Monitoring.", "journal": ["Circulation.
