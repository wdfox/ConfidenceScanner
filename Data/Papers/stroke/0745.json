The aim of this study was to examine the prognostic significance of DIC in patients with HS using a nationwide registry.Data regarding HS were obtained and analyzed from three prospective, observational, multicenter HS registries (HSRs): 2010, 2012, and 2014. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify independent predictors of hospital death. DIC was diagnosed according to the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine (JAAM) diagnostic criteria, with a total score\u22654 implying a DIC diagnosis.In total, 705 (median age, 68years; 501 men) were included in this study. Hospital mortality was 7.1% (50 patients). Multiple regression analysis revealed that hospital mortality was significantly associated with presence of DIC (odds ratio [OR], 2.16; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-4.27; p=0.028). Mortality worsened as the DIC score increased, and increased remarkably to approximately 10% when the DIC score was 2.Presence of DIC was an independent prognostic factor of hospital mortality in patients with HS.
