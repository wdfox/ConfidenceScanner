The experimental group performed EMST using a portable EMST device, while the placebo group performed EMST using a sham EMST device with no loading. The intervention was performed 5 days per week for 4weeks, in five sets of 5 breaths through the device for a total of 25 breaths per day. Both groups underwent conventional dysphagia treatment for 30 minutes/day, 5 days/week, for 4 weeks. Videofluoroscopic dysphagia scale (VDS) and penetration-aspiration scale (PAS) based on a videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) were assessed to analyze the oropharyngeal swallowing function.The experimental group showed more improvement in pharyngeal phase of the VDS (p\u200a=\u200a0.018 and 0.006, respectively) and PAS compared to the placebo group (p\u200a=\u200a0.014).We suggest that EMST could improve the effects of dysphagia observed in post-stroke elderly patients based on swallowing function.", "doi": "10.3233/NRE-172192", "title": "Effects of resistance expiratory muscle strength training in elderly patients with dysphagic stroke.", "journal": ["NeuroRehabilitation", "NeuroRehabilitation"]}
