This study sought to determine the relationship between the AF pattern and the severity and brain volume of infarction in an AF population including transient ischaemic attack (TIA) patients.This was a retrospective observational study. We studied 161 consecutive patients who were admitted to our stroke care unit with cardiogenic embolism or TIA related to non-valvular AF (age 79\u2009\u00b1\u20099.5, 78 females, and 87 PAF patients). We evaluated the differences in severity and infarct volume between the types of AF. Additionally, we divided the patients into three groups according to severe stroke (n\u2009=\u200938), TIA (n\u2009=\u200928), and those who were neither (stroke, n\u2009=\u200995) for the assessment of the predictors of severe stroke and TIA. Persistent or permanent atrial fibrillation patients with acute cardiogenic stroke or TIA had worse peak National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores [PAF median 4 (range 3-14), PeAF 17 (5.8-25); P\u2009<\u20090.0001] and worse NIHSS scores at discharge [PAF 2.0 (1-7), PeAF 11 (3-22); P\u2009<\u20090.0001]. Their infarct brain volume assessed by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging was also larger [PAF 4.4 (1.1-32)\u2009mL, PeAF 64 (6.9-170)\u2009mL; P\u2009<\u20090.0001]. Multivariate analysis of severe stroke vs. non-severe stroke patients showed that having PeAF was the only independent predictor of severe stroke [odds ratio (OR) 4.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.91-10.2; P\u2009=\u20090.0003]. Comparison of TIA vs. non-TIA patients showed that PeAF (OR 0.120, 95% CI 0.0230-0.444; P\u2009=\u20090.0008) and anticoagulant use (OR 8.24, 95% CI 2.15-40.8; P\u2009=\u20090.0018) were independent predictors of TIA.Cardiogenic emboli due to non-valvular PeAF are associated with a worse acute clinical course and greater volume of infarction than those due to PAF.", "doi": "10.1093/europace/eux346", "title": "Atrial fibrillation type matters: greater infarct volume and worse neurological defects seen in acute cardiogenic cerebral embolism due to persistent or permanent rather than paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.", "journal": ["Europace : European pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac electrophysiology : journal of the working groups on cardiac pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac cellular electrophysiology of the European Society of Cardiology", "Europace"]}
