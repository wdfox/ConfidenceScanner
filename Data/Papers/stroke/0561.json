Neurological examination revealed that he was alert, but did not appropriately respond to verbal questions and commands. Detailed examination revealed that he could correctly respond to written commands. His speech was almost fluent, showing no paraphasia and normal articulation. His written sentences were legible. Pure tone audiometry showed that his auditory acuity was relatively preserved. His brainstem auditory evoked potential components from I to V were recorded bilaterally with normal latency. Cerebral CT demonstrated fresh bleeding in the left putamen and an old haemorrhage on the opposite side. He was treated by antihypertensive therapy and rehabilitation. Although there remained mild sensory deficit on his right extremities and he felt a slight noise during conversation, he had little difficulty with verbal communication when he was transferred to another hospital on day 38.", "doi": "10.1136/bcr-2017-222535", "title": "Auditory agnosia caused by bilateral putamen haemorrhage.", "journal": ["BMJ case reports", "BMJ Case Rep"]}
