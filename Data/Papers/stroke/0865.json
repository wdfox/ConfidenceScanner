This study examined long-term influence of concomitant full Cox maze (CM) and mitral valve procedures on freedom from atrial arrhythmia and stroke.This sample comprised patients who underwent CM with a mitral valve procedure (N\u00a0=\u00a0473). Data on rhythm, medication status, and clinical events captured according to Heart Rhythm Society guidelines at 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24\u00a0months and yearly thereafter up to 7\u00a0years.Mean age was 65\u00a0years, mean left atrium size was 5.3\u00a0cm, and 15% had paroxysmal AF. Perioperative stroke occurred in 2 patients (0.4%) and operative mortality was 2.7% (n\u00a0=\u00a013). Return to sinus rhythm regardless of antiarrhythmic drugs at 1, 5, and 7\u00a0years was 90%, 80%, and 66%. Sinus rhythm off antiarrhythmic drugs at 1, 5, and 7\u00a0years was 83%, 69%, and 55%. Freedom from embolic stroke at 7\u00a0years was 96.6% (0.4 strokes per 100 patient-years) with a majority of patients off anticoagulation medication. Greater odds of atrial arrhythmia recurrence during 7\u00a0years was associated with longer AF duration (odds ratio [OR], 1.07; P\u00a0=\u00a0.001), whereas lower odds were associated with cryothermal energy only (OR, 0.64; P\u00a0=\u00a0.045) and greater surgeon experience (OR, 0.98; P\u00a0=\u00a0.025).This study suggests that the addition of CM to mitral valve procedures, even with a high degree of complexity, did not increase operative risk. In long-term follow-up, the CM procedure demonstrated acceptable rhythm success, reduced AF burden, and remarkably low stroke rate. Individual surgeon experience and training may notably influence long-term surgical ablation for AF success.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jtcvs.2017.09.147", "title": "Long-term outcome following concomitant mitral valve surgery and Cox maze procedure for atrial fibrillation.", "journal": ["The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery", "J.
