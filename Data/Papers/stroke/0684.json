Study-specific HRs with 95% CIs were aggregated for all-cause mortality, major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE), and other cardiovascular events at time points of 30 days, 1\u2009year and 3 years and beyond.Six RCTs comprising 4700 patients were included. There were no significant differences in risk of all-cause mortality in pooled analysis of relevant trials at 30 days (0.61, 95%\u2009CI 0.27 to 1.36), 1\u2009year (0.66, 95%\u2009CI 0.42 to 1.04), and 3 years and beyond (1.04, 95%\u2009CI 0.81 to 1.33), comparing PCI with CABG. There was no significant difference in the risk of MACCE at 30 days (0.72, 95%\u2009CI 0.51 to 1.03) and 1\u2009year (1.16, 95%\u2009CI 0.94 to 1.44); however, PCI was associated with a higher risk of MACCE compared with CABG during longer-term follow-up (1.27, 95%\u2009CI 1.12 to 1.44). Composite outcome of death, stroke or myocardial infarction was lower with PCI at 30 days (0.67, 95%\u2009CI 0.49 to 0.92). Repeat revascularisation was increased at 1\u2009year and at 3 years and beyond for PCI.All-cause mortality rates are not significantly different between PCI and CABG at short-term and long-term follow-up. However, PCI is associated with a reduction in the risk of major cardiovascular outcomes at short-term follow-up in patients with LMCA stenosis; but at long term, MACCE rate is increased for PCI.", "doi": "10.1136/openhrt-2017-000638", "title": "All-cause mortality and major cardiovascular outcomes comparing percutaneous coronary angioplasty versus coronary artery bypass grafting in the treatment of unprotected left main stenosis: a meta-analysis of short-term and long-term randomised trials.", "journal": ["Open heart", "Open Heart"]}
