This study aimed to explore the role of NLRP3 in the delayed rtPA-induced HT and its association with the neutrophil recruitment.Rats were subjected to thromboembolic focal cerebral ischemia and delayed rtPA treatment at 4\u202fh after ischemia to mimic HT. NLRP3 short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) were administered 72\u202fh before ischemia. Additionally, rabbit anti-rat neutrophil serum (inducing neutropenia) was administered before cerebral ischemia. The infarct volume, edema volume, neurological deficit, hemorrhages, blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity and brain neutrophil recruitment were evaluated at 24\u202fh after cerebral ischemia.Our results demonstrated that delayed rtPA treatment at 4\u202fh after ischemia promoted the expression of NLRP3 in neurons, microglia and endothelial cells, degradation of BBB components, and HT. NLRP3 knockdown significantly attenuated NLRP3 expression, BBB disruption, and HT. It also improved neurological functions and reduced neutrophil recruitment. Rabbit anti-rat neutrophil serum, like NLRP3 shRNA, reduced hemorrhage score and hemorrhage volumes after rtPA treatment. Furthermore, the anti-rat neutrophil serum combined with NLRP3 shRNA didn't further increase the protective effect on HT compared to rabbit anti-rat neutrophil serum used alone.Together, our data suggest that NLRP3 inhibition can reduce neutrophil recruitment, which may contribute to the inhibitory effect on HT.", "doi": "10.1016/j.brainresbull.2017.12.009", "title": "Suppression of NLRP3 attenuates hemorrhagic transformation after delayed rtPA treatment in thromboembolic stroke rats: Involvement of neutrophil recruitment.", "journal": ["Brain research bulletin", "Brain Res.
