The genotype IL-1(+) is associated with higher rates of inflammation than IL-1(-) genotype. Targeting IL-1\u03b2 was recently shown to decrease CVD events independent of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels.The objective of the study is to assess the modulatory effect of IL-1 genotypes on risk mediated by Lp(a) METHODS: We assessed whether IL-1 genotypes modulate the effect of Lp(a) on major adverse cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke/transient ischemic attack) and angiographically determined coronary artery disease (CAD). IL-1 genotypes and Lp(a) were measured in 603 patients without diabetes mellitus undergoing angiography. Major adverse cardiovascular events and CAD were assessed over a median of 45\u00a0months.In multivariable-adjusted analysis, Lp(a) was associated with major adverse cardiovascular events (hazard ratio [HR] [95% confidence interval {CI}]: 2.95 [1.16-7.54], P\u00a0=\u00a0.023) and CAD (odds ratio [OR] [95% CI]: 1.84\u00a0[1.12-3.03], P\u00a0=\u00a0.016) comparing quartile 4 vs quartile 1. In Cox regression analysis, IL-1(+) patients with Lp(a) above the median (>9.2\u00a0mg/dL) had a worse event-free cumulative survival (HR [95% CI]: 3.59 [1.07-12.03], P\u00a0=\u00a0.039) compared to IL-1(-) patients with Lp(a) below the median. In IL-1(+) patients aged \u226460\u00a0years, Lp(a) was also associated with angiographically determined CAD (OR [95% CI]: 2.90 [1.07-7.86], P\u00a0=\u00a0.036) comparing quartile 4 vs quartile 1 but not IL-1(-) patients.Proinflammatory IL-1(+) genotypes modulate the risk of Lp(a) long-term CVD events and CAD. These data suggest that the dual genetic contributions of elevated Lp(a) levels and IL-1(+) genotypes may identify younger subjects at particularly high risk for CVD events.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jacl.2017.12.004", "title": "Interleukin-1 genotypes modulate the long-term effect of lipoprotein(a) on cardiovascular events: The Ioannina Study.", "journal": ["Journal of clinical lipidology", "J Clin Lipidol"]}
