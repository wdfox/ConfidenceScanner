To prevent this dangerous situation, we designed a wearable heat-stroke-detection device (WHDD) with early notification ability. First, we used several physical sensors, such as galvanic skin response (GSR), heart beat, and body temperature, to acquire medical data from exercising people. In addition, we designed risk evaluation functional components that were based on fuzzy theory to detect the features of heat stroke for users. If a dangerous situation is detected, then the device will activate the alert function to remind the user to respond adequately to avoid heat stroke.", "doi": "10.3390/s18010017", "title": "Design and Development of a Wearable Device for Heat Stroke Detection.", "journal": ["Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "Sensors (Basel)"]}
