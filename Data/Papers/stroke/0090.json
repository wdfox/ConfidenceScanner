Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores >17 and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) were used separately to screen and diagnose IPSD at 3, 6, and 9 months post-stroke. Once IPSD was diagnosed, follow-up activities were terminated.High levels of SUA (odds ratio [OR]=2.08, P<0.01) and Tbil (OR=2.31, P<0.01) in the first 3 months post-stroke and low levels of SUA (OR=2.05, P=0.03) and Tbil (OR=2.79, P<0.01) from 3 to 6 months post-stroke were identified as risk factors for major IPSD. At 3 months, patients with SUA levels \u2265406.5 \u03bcmol/L (males with SUA levels of \u2265409.5 \u03bcmol/L and females with SUA levels \u2265385.5 \u03bcmol/L) and Tbil levels \u226523.65 \u03bcmol/L were more likely to develop major IPSD. At 6 months, both SUA (area under curve [AUC]=0.625, P=0.005, cutoff =194.0 \u03bcmol/L) and Tbil (AUC=0.681, P=0.004, cutoff =6.75 \u03bcmol/L) had minor diagnostic values (AUC<0.700), although SUA levels \u2264214.5 \u03bcmol/L (AUC=0.756, P=0.001) in female patients had a good diagnostic value (AUC=0.722, P=0.006) for major IPSD. At 9 months, major IPSD showed no statistical relationship with either SUA (\u03c72=2.33, P=0.13) or Tbil (\u03c72=0.41, P=0.84).Higher levels of SUA and Tbil on admission were closely related to the occurrence of major IPSD within 3 months of stroke. Lower levels of these two biomarkers on admission were characteristic for the occurrence of major IPSD between 3 and 6 months post-stroke, while 6 months after stroke, there was no relationship between major IPSD and these two biomarkers.", "doi": "10.2147/NDT.S149712", "title": "Changes of serum uric acid and total bilirubin in elderly patients with major postischemic stroke depression.", "journal": ["Neuropsychiatric disease and treatment", "Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat"]}
