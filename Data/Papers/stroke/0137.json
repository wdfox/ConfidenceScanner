In this study, we investigated injury of the STT in patients with CPSP following cerebral infarction, using DTT. Five patients with CPSP following cerebral infarction and eight age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects were recruited for this study. STT was examined using DTT. Among DTT parameters of the affected STT, fractional anisotropy and tract volume were decreased by more than two standard deviations in two patients (patients 1 and 2) and three patients (patients 3, 4, and 5), respectively, compared with those of the control subjects, while mean diffusivity value was increased by more than two standard deviations in one patient (patient 2). Regarding DTT configuration, all affected STTs passed through adjacent part of the infarct and three STTs showed narrowing. These findings suggest that injury of the STT might be a pathogenetic etiology of CPSP in patients with cerebral infarction.", "doi": "10.4103/1673-5374.221159", "title": "Central post-stroke pain due to injury of the spinothalamic tract in patients with cerebral infarction: a diffusion tensor tractography imaging study.", "journal": ["Neural regeneration research", "Neural Regen Res"]}
