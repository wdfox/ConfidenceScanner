Mean age in our sample was 69\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08 years; 63% of patients were men. The incidence of stroke in patients aged 80 and older was 5.1%. Five patients (31%) underwent emergency surgery. By type of cardiac surgery, 7% of patients underwent mitral valve surgery, 6.5% combined surgery, 3% aortic valve surgery, and 2.24% coronary surgery. Most cases of stroke (44%) were due to embolism, followed by hypoperfusion (25%). Stroke occurred within 2 days of surgery in 69% of cases. The mean NIHSS score in our sample of stroke patients was 9; code stroke was activated in 10 cases (62%); one patient (14%) underwent thrombectomy. Most patients progressed favourably: 13 (80%) scored\u22642 on the modified Rankin Scale at 3 months. None of the patients died during the postoperative hospital stay.In our setting, strokes occurring after cardiac surgery are usually small and have a good long-term prognosis. Most of them occur within 2 days, and they are mostly embolic in origin. The incidence of stroke in patients aged 80 and older and undergoing cardiac surgery is twice as high as that of the general population.", "doi": "10.1016/j.nrl.2017.10.004", "title": "Incidence and etiological mechanism of stroke in cardiac surgery.", "journal": ["Neurologia (Barcelona, Spain)", "Neurologia"]}
