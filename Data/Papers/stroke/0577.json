Most had pre-discharge mRS scores of 4/5. Factors (odds ratios; 95% confidence intervals) associated with CH discharge included age (1.07; 1.05-1.10), incontinence (11.5; 7.13-19.25), dysphagia (2.13; 1.39-3.29), severe weakness (1.93; 1.28-2.92), pneumonia (1.68; 1.13-2.50), urinary tract infection (UTI) (1.70; 1.04-2.75) and depression (1.65; 1.00-2.72). In a subgroup of all patients with a pre-discharge mRS of 4/5, age (1.04; 1.02-1.06), incontinence (4.87; 2.39-11.02), UTI (2.0; 1.09-3.71) and pneumonia (1.59; 1.02-2.50) were the only factors associated with CH discharge.Potentially modifiable variables like incontinence, UTI and pneumonia were associated with CH discharge, particularly in the severely disabled.", "doi": "10.1177/0269215517748715", "title": "Using population-based routinely collected data from the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme to investigate factors associated with discharge to care home after rehabilitation.", "journal": ["Clinical rehabilitation", "Clin Rehabil"]}
