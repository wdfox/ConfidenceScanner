However, previous studies suggest that some patients with UOS may benefit from reperfusion. Several imaging modalities have been suggested to select patients for intervention, but the optimal imaging criteria are still controversial. Herein we present a series of four cases using 10-point CT-ASPECTS to support our decision of reperfusion therapy. We decided based on history, symptoms, and the 10-point CT-ASPECTS alone. Each patient's history suggested that the stroke just took place. All four patients had apparent clinical symptoms, with 10-point CT-ASPECTS. All of them had a reduction in their NIHSS after the reperfusion therapy. 10-point CT-ASPECTS could be used to support the presumption that the stroke just happens in patients with UOS. Further study is warranted to elucidate the value of CT-ASPECTS for UOS patients.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jfma.2017.12.002", "title": "10-Point CT-ASPECTS-based reperfusion therapy for unknown onset stroke.", "journal": ["Journal of the Formosan Medical Association = Taiwan yi zhi", "J.
