In the female group, none of the analyzed risk factors were associated with a higher risk of periprocedural incident, while in men, only hypercholesterolemia was a significant predictor of perioperative stroke (TC > 240 vs 240 vs 200-240: OR = 6.59; 95% CI: 1.12-38.97; p = 0.0375).In men, hypercholesterolemia significantly increased the risk of perioperative stroke or death, while in females, none of the analyzed factors were determined as the predictors of the incident. The fact that plaque type VI by AHA was significantly more frequent in women and men more frequently were suffering from ischemic heart disease and peripheral artery occlusive disease appeared not to influence the outcome of CEA.", "doi": null, "title": "Gender-related risk factors for perioperative stroke after carotid endarterectomy in symptomatic patients.", "journal": ["Advances in clinical and experimental medicine : official organ Wroclaw Medical University", "Adv Clin Exp Med"]}
