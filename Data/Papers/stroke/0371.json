Patients were matched 1:1 or age, gender, functional level at admission, injury severity and length of stay with inpatients who completed rehabilitation before cranioplasty. Main outcome measures include FIMTM (Functional Independence Measure) and FIMTM efficiency [(FIMTM discharge - FIMTMadmission)/number of days in rehabilitation]. To examine within and between group differences, analyses included paired and independent t-tests, Pearson correlations and chi-square analyses.Twenty-six individuals (13 from the cranioplasty group and 13 from the comparison group) were analysed. FIMTM efficiency increased following cranioplasty [0.29 to 0.61; t(12)\u00a0=\u00a0-2.77, p\u00a0=\u00a00.017]. The mean FIMTM efficiency for the cranioplasty group was below that of the comparison group prior to cranioplasty [0.28\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.37 and 0.39\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.32, p\u00a0=\u00a0.41], but increased following cranioplasty [0.61\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.71 and 0.39\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.32, p\u00a0=\u00a0.32]. An improvement in FIMTM efficiency following cranioplasty was more commonly seen among individuals with less severe brain injuries (75%, \u03c72\u00a0=\u00a03.8, df\u00a0=\u00a01, p\u00a0=\u00a00.053).Rate of recovery increased following cranioplasty and exceeded that of the comparison group suggesting that cranioplasty may contribute to improvement.", "doi": "10.1080/02699052.2017.1419283", "title": "The therapeutic value of cranioplasty in individuals with brain injury.", "journal": ["Brain injury", "Brain Inj"]}
