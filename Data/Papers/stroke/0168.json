Since MAP is dependent on cardiac function, optimization of cardiac output might be a valuable hemodynamic goal in order to optimize cerebral perfusion (CP).Cerebral perfusion was assessed by transcranial color-coded duplex and transcranial perfusion sonography in 10 patients with acute large hemispheric stroke. Time-to-peak (TTP) values of defined regions of interest (ROI) within the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory were assessed bilaterally in addition to mean flow velocities of the MCA. Via semi-invasive advanced hemodynamic monitoring systemic hemodynamic parameters were assessed, including MAP and cardiac index (CI). Patients received sonographic follow-up after optimizing CI.TTP values of the deeply located ROIs of the non-affected as well as the affected hemisphere correlated highly significantly with CI (in affected side r\u2009=\u2009-0.827, p\u2009=\u20090.002; and in non-affected side r\u2009=\u2009-0.908, p\u2009<\u20090.0001). This demonstrates dependence of CP on CI, while correlation with MAP was not detected. Neither CI nor MAP revealed significant correlation with MCA velocity.", "doi": "10.3389/fneur.2017.00706", "title": "Paradigm Change?
