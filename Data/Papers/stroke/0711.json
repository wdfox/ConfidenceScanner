Patients were classified into within-time-window group (ONT \u2264 4.5 h) and beyond-time-window group (ONT>4.5 h). Good and poor outcome were defined as modified Rankin scale (mRS) \u2264 2 or >2 at 3 months, respectively. The maximal infarct volume was analyzed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.Among 587 patients (465 cases were within-time-window, 122 cases were beyond-time-window), baseline core volume was 15(2-46)mL,and 324 (55.2%) patients achieved good outcome. Compared with the good-outcome group, the baseline core volume was larger in the poor-outcome group (32 mL vs 5 mL,Z=-9.766,P<0.01). After adjusting age, ONT, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and atrial fibrillation, baseline infarct core volume independently predicted poor outcome (OR=1.014, 95% CI:1.008-1.020, P<0.01). The ROC curve analysis showed that the maximal infarct core volume for achieving good outcome in the within-time-window group and beyond-time-window group were 152 mL and 71mL, respectively. The maximal infarct volume to benefit from IVT diminished with the increasing delayed ONT of every 30 min (\u03c1=-0.691, P<0.05).The maximal infarct volume to benefit from thrombolysis is larger in patients treated within time window than those beyond the time window, and that volume diminishes with ONT delay.", "doi": null, "title": "[Maximal infarct volume to benefit from intravenous thrombolysis and its relation with onset to treatment time].", "journal": ["Zhejiang da xue xue bao.
