This is characterized by sustained vertigo, horizontal or horizontal rotatory jerk nystagmus, and unsteady stance and gait. In the acute situation it is crucial to differentiate patients with a\u00a0peripheral vestibular disorder from those with a\u00a0central disease. A\u00a0number of recent studies have shown that a\u00a0structured clinical examination enables a\u00a0reliable differential diagnosis of central or peripheral disorders. Such an examination includes the head impulse test, an alternating cover test to detect a\u00a0skew deviation of the eyes, and observation of nystagmus in different positions of gaze and using Frenzel goggles. This examination is more sensitive for the detection of brainstem stroke than magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), at least within 48\u2009h after symptom onset. As these facts are still little known, in practice there is an overuse of cost-intensive imaging with computed tomography and MRI, and a\u00a0number of patient brainstem strokes in the vertebrobasilar circulation may be missed. This paper describes the relevant studies on this topic.", "doi": "10.1007/s00115-017-0461-5", "title": "[Acute vestibular syndrome : Clinical examination outperforms MRI in the detection of central lesions].", "journal": ["Der Nervenarzt", "Nervenarzt"]}
