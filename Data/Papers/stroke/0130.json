The authors aimed to identify independent predictors for hospital mortality in redo mitral valve surgery as possible future selection criteria for TM-VIVoR.Retrospective multicenter registry.Tertiary university and community hospitals.Two-hundred and sixty patients (out of 920 enrolled) who are potentially candidates for TM-VIVoR undergoing redo-surgery.Redo mitral surgery.Regression analyzes and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves identified independent predictors of death. Patients potentially candidates for TM-VIVoR reported significant hospital mortality (9.2%; EuroSCORE II: 13.2 \u00b1 13.1, Society of Thoracic Surgeons [STS] score: 6.2 \u00b1 3.1) and major morbidity (3.8% acute myocardial infarction, 5% stroke, 16.9% perioperative respiratory failure, 16.5% acute renal insufficiency, 25% massive transfusions). EuroSCORE II (odds ration [OR] 1.06; confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.10; p = 0.005), STS score (OR 1.58; CI 1.27-1.97; p = 0.001), age at surgery (OR 1.05; CI 1.00-1.15; p = 0.05), preoperative dialysis (OR 2.5; CI 1.8-12.6; p = 0.042), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <30% (OR 4.8; CI 1.12-37.1; p = 0.021), severe pulmonary hypertension (OR 7.5; CI 1.9-29.4; p = 0.003), and previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) (OR 11.8; CI 1.7-36.9; p = 0.002) were independent predictors of hospital mortality. ROC analyses reported good prediction for EuroSCORE II (AUC: 0.76; cut-off value: >13.1; 70.8% sensitivity and 68.2% specificity) and better prediction for STS score (AUC: 0.81; cut-off value: 7.4; 75.0% sensitivity and 66.2% specificity). Quintiles stratification identified EuroSCORE II \u226518.7 (5th quintile, observed mortality: 19.3%) and STS score >9.1 as strong predictors of death within each risk-categorization (OR 5.9 and 12.1, respectively).High EuroSCORE II and STS scores, advanced age at surgery, LVEF <30%, previous CABG, severe pulmonary hypertension or preoperative dialysis might represent in the future preferred indications for TM-VIVoR in the redo-mitral surgery scenario.", "doi": "10.1053/j.jvca.2017.09.039", "title": "Hospital Outcome and Risk Indices of Mortality in Potential Candidates for Transcatheter Procedures: Results From a European Registry.", "journal": ["Journal of cardiothoracic and vascular anesthesia", "J.
