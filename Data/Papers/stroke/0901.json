It is strongly characterized by the activation of microglia which can be visualized using position emission tomography (PET). Traditionally, translocator protein 18\u00a0kDa (TSPO) has been the preferred target for imaging the inflammatory progression of the microglial component. TSPO is expressed in the outer mitochondrial membrane and present in very low concentrations in the healthy human brain, but is markedly upregulated in response to brain injury and inflammation. Due to its value as a marker of microglial activation and subsequent utility for evaluating neuroinflammation in CNS disorders, several classes of TSPO radioligands have been developed and evaluated. However, the application of these second-generation TSPO radiotracers has been subject to several limiting factors, including a polymorphism that affects TSPO binding. This review focuses on recent developments in TSPO imaging, as well as current limitations and suggestions for future directions from a medical imaging perspective.", "doi": "10.1007/s13139-017-0475-8", "title": "Recent Progress in the Development of TSPO PET Ligands for Neuroinflammation Imaging in Neurological Diseases.", "journal": ["Nuclear medicine and molecular imaging", "Nucl Med Mol Imaging"]}
