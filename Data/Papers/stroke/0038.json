We investigated autonomic cardiovascular control, as well as the separate effects of cooling, hypothermia and rewarming on hemodynamic function, aiming to provide knowledge of the pathophysiology causing such complications in these patients.A rat model designed for circulatory studies during cooling, hypothermia (15{degree sign}C) and rewarming was used. Spectral analysis of diastolic arterial pressure and heart rate allowed assessment of the autonomic nervous system. Hemodynamic variables were monitored using a conductance catheter in the left ventricle and a pressure transducer connected to the left femoral artery.Sympathetic cardiovascular control was reduced after rewarming. Stroke volume (SV) increased during cooling, but decreased during stable hypothermia and did not normalize during rewarming. Despite autonomic dysfunction, total peripheral resistance increased during cooling and did not normalize after rewarming.The present data show that sympathetic cardiovascular control is reduced by hypothermia and rewarming. A simultaneous systolic dysfunction is seen in rewarmed animals, caused by reduced filling of the left ventricle and impaired contractile function, in presence of normal diastolic function. These findings show that dysfunction of the efferent sympathetic nervous system could be instrumental in development of rewarming shock.", "doi": "10.1152/japplphysiol.00317.2017", "title": "Effects of hypothermia and rewarming on cardiovascular autonomic control in vivo.", "journal": ["Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)", "J.
