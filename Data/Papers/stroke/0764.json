Two independent and prospectively collected patient validation cohorts were used: (a) referral cohort-prospectively referred emergency department and general practitioner patients ( N = 877); and (b) SpecTRA cohort-participants recruited as part of the SpecTRA biomarker project ( N = 545). Outcome measure consisted of imaging-confirmed clinical diagnosis of mild stroke/transient ischemic attack. Results showed that our clinical prediction rule demonstrated significantly higher accuracy than the ABCD2 score for both the referral cohort (70.5% vs 59.0%; p < 0.001) and SpecTRA cohort (72.8% vs 68.3%; p = 0.028). We discuss the potential of our clinical prediction rule to replace the use of the ABCD2 score in the triage of transient ischemic attack clinic referrals.", "doi": "10.1177/1460458217747111", "title": "Validation of a multivariate clinical prediction model for the diagnosis of mild stroke/transient ischemic attack in physician first-contact patient settings.", "journal": ["Health informatics journal", "Health Informatics J"]}
