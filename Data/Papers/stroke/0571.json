In this retrospective cohort study using the National Inpatient Sample 2011 to 2014, we included a total of 2,820 TAVI and 4,054 SAVR procedures, representative of 14,039 TAVI and 19,835 SAVR procedures nationally. Co-primary outcomes were in-hospital mortality, acute kidney injury (AKI), dialysis-requiring AKI, and postoperative stroke. In multivariate analysis, TAVI was associated with a lower in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR] 0.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.32 to 0.69, p\u2009<\u20090.001), rates of AKI (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.22, p\u2009<\u20090.001), dialysis-requiring AKI (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.44, p\u2009<\u20090.001), and postoperative stroke (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.53, p\u2009<\u20090.001) compared with SAVR. In 1001 propensity-matched pairs of TAVI and SAVR procedures, TAVI was associated with lower in-hospital mortality (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.99, p\u2009=\u20090.047) rates of AKI (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.46, p\u2009<\u20090.001), dialysis-requiring AKI (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.81, p\u2009<\u20090.001), postoperative stroke (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.98, p\u2009=\u20090.045), significantly shorter length of stay (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.42, p\u2009<\u20090.001), and nonsignificant difference in cost (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.26, p\u2009=\u20090.57) compared with SAVR. In conclusion, TAVI may be a preferable approach to SAVR in patients with severe aortic stenosis in the setting of chronic kidney disease.", "doi": "10.1016/j.amjcard.2017.10.029", "title": "Comparison of Outcomes of Transcatheter Versus Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease.", "journal": ["The American journal of cardiology", "Am.
