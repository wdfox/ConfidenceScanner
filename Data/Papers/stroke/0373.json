The major challenge in such population is the balance between the benefit of reduced stroke and coronary ischemic events, against the risk of increased bleeding complications. Thus, both thrombotic and bleeding risk assessments should be included into clinical decision-making process for such patients. Currently, there is limited evidence based on randomized trials with adequate power to show the superiority of any strategy in the beneficial profile of safety and efficacy, thus limited recommendations are provided by clinical guidelines. Given the recent advancement in this field, our review provided an overview of the available risk stratification schemes for stroke and bleeding risk for AF patients, discussed the multiple questions in the optimal regimens of oral antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy, and summarized evidence and recommendations related to long-term antithrombotic therapy for AF patients receiving stent implications.", "doi": "10.2174/1381612824666171227215246", "title": "Antithrombotic strategies in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.", "journal": ["Current pharmaceutical design", "Curr.
