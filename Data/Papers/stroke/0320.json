This study aims to estimate the long-term risk of stroke recurrence and functional outcome in patients with migrainous infarction. In our study, 15 patients with migrainous infarction were followed for up to 7.5 years (12-240 months). For each patient, clinical and imaging data were reviewed. Disability after migrainous Infarction was assessed with modified Rankin Score. Mean age was 34.8 (\u00b1\u202f11.1)\u202fyears. At the end of the follow-up 80% of the patients had favorable prognosis, 47% recovered completely and no patient died or had stroke recurrence. Our series also confirmed a low frequency of the traditional risk factors and the reduction of migraine frequency after migrainous infarction. This study has clinical implications and public health relevance, since our case series confirms a low frequency, low recurrence rate, and good functional outcome for patients with migrainous infarction.", "doi": "10.1016/j.clineuro.2017.12.008", "title": "Long-term follow-up of patients with migrainous infarction.", "journal": ["Clinical neurology and neurosurgery", "Clin Neurol Neurosurg"]}
