Here, we further determined the optimal daily dosage and total duration of intensive speech-language therapy.Individuals with chronic aphasia more than 1\u2009year post-stroke received Intensive Language-Action Therapy in a randomised, parallel-group, blinded-assessment, controlled trial. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two outpatient groups who engaged in either highly-intensive practice (Group I: 4\u2009hours daily) or moderately-intensive practice (Group II: 2\u2009hours daily). Both groups went through an initial waiting period and two successive training intervals. Each phase lasted 2\u2009weeks. Co-primary endpoints were defined after each training interval.Thirty patients-15 per group-completed the study. A primary outcome measure (Aachen Aphasia Test) revealed no gains in language performance after the waiting period, but indicated significant progress after each training interval (gradual 2-week t-score change [CI]: 1.7 [\u00b10.4]; 0.6 [\u00b10.5]), independent of the intensity level applied (4-week change in Group I: 2.4 [\u00b11.2]; in Group II: 2.2 [\u00b10.8]). A secondary outcome measure (Action Communication Test) confirmed these findings in the waiting period and in the first training interval. In the second training interval, however, only patients with moderately-intensive practice continued to make progress (Time-by-Group interaction: P=0.009, \u03b72=0.13).Our results suggest no added value from more than 2\u2009hours of daily speech-language therapy within 4\u2009weeks. Instead, these results demonstrate that even a small 2-week increase in treatment duration contributes substantially to recovery from chronic post-stroke aphasia.", "doi": "10.1136/jnnp-2017-315962", "title": "Efficacy of intensive aphasia therapy in patients with chronic stroke: a randomised controlled trial.", "journal": ["Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry", "J.
