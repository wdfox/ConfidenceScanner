Clinical and echocardiographic outcomes were assessed at baseline, discharge, and 30\u00a0days. Major events were adjudicated by an independent clinical events committee. Echocardiograms and computed tomography scans were reviewed by core laboratories. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality at 30\u00a0days.Between March 25, 2015 and July 5, 2016, 203 patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis and increased surgical risk, as determined by the heart team, were treated by transfemoral THV implantation (age 82.7 \u00b1 5.5 years, 67.5% female, 68.0% New York Heart Association functional class III/IV). At 30\u00a0days, mortality was 1%, disabling stroke occurred in 2.5% of patients, and New York Heart Association functional class I/II was observed in 93.0% of patients. Effective orifice area increased from 0.71 \u00b1 0.20\u00a0cm2 to 1.88 \u00b1 0.43\u00a0cm2 (p\u00a0< 0.001). Mean aortic transvalvular gradient decreased from 40.5 \u00b1 13.2\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg to 7.2 \u00b1 2.8\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg at 30\u00a0days post-procedure (p\u00a0< 0.001). Paravalvular aortic regurgitation at 30\u00a0days was moderate or higher in 0.6% of patients. A new permanent pacemaker was implanted in 4.5% of patients receiving the THV (4.9% for patients at risk).The herein described THV is safe and effective at 30\u00a0days with low mortality, significant improvements in hemodynamic outcomes, and low incidence of adverse events. Of particular interest is the low incidence of\u00a0permanent\u00a0pacemaker implantations.
