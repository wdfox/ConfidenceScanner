Significant coronary artery disease (CAD) is present in 40% to 75% of patients undergoing TAVR. However, when to treat the concomitant coronary artery lesions is controversial.This is a systematic review comparing concomitant PCI and TAVR versus staged PCI and TAVR. The OVID database was systematically searched for studies reporting PCI in patients undergoing TAVR. A random effects model was used to calculate the pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals.Four observational studies and a total of 209 patients were included in this analysis. Overall 30-day mortality was similar between concomitant PCI and TAVR versus staged PCI and TAVR [OR: 1.47 (0.47-4.62); P\u200a=\u200a.51], renal failure was not significantly different between both groups [OR: 3.22 (0.61-17.12); P\u200a=\u200a.17], periprocedural myocardial infarction was not different between the 2 groups [OR: 1.44 (0.12-16.94); P\u200a=\u200a.77], life-threatening bleeding did not differ between both groups [OR: 0.45 (0.11-1.87); P\u200a=\u200a.27], and major stroke also was not significantly different [OR: 3.41 (0.16-74.2); P\u200a=\u200a.44].These data did not show a significant difference in short-term outcomes between concomitant PCI and TAVR versus staged PCI and TAVR.", "doi": "10.1097/MD.0000000000008919", "title": "The safety of concomitant transcatheter aortic valve replacement and percutaneous coronary intervention: A systematic review and meta-analysis.", "journal": ["Medicine", "Medicine (Baltimore)"]}
