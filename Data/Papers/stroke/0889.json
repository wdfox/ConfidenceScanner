Outcome measures included major adverse cardiac/cerebrovascular events (MACCE; all-cause death, myocardial infarction, repeat revascularization, stent thrombosis, or stroke/transient ischemic attack) and bleeding events at 12-month follow-up.Out of 925 AF patients enrolled in AFCAS registry, 195 (21.1%) were \u226580 years. Mean age was 82.9 \u00b1 2.6 years; 41.5% were women; 32.3% had diabetes mellitus. Compared with patients aged <80 years, there were more females among the octogenarians (P < 0.001). Compared with younger patients, octogenarians smoked and had dyslipidemia less often, and presented more frequently with acute coronary syndrome. The frequency and duration of antithrombotic regimens prescribed at discharge were comparable. At 12-month follow-up, overall MACCE rate was higher in octogenarians compared with younger patients (27.7% vs 20.1%, P = 0.02). The rate of acute myocardial infarction was higher in octogenarians (9.2% vs 4.9%, P = 0.02), but the rates of all bleeds and BARC >2 bleeds were similar (P = 0.13, P = 0.29, respectively).In real-world patients with AF undergoing PCI, patients aged \u226580 years had higher incidence of MACCE at 12-month follow-up compared with younger patients, although they received comparable antithrombotic treatment.
