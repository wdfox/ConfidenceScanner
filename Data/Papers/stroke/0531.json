Classic presentation includes livedo reticularis, vasculitis, and stroke. However, the phenotype and disease severity are variable. We present a 5-year-old female who presented with features that mimicked autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) in the absence of classic features of DADA2. Exome sequencing identified a novel homozygous splicing variant in ADA2 c.882-2A\u00a0>\u00a0G. Patient responded to anti- tumor necrosis factor medication and is in complete remission. Hematologists should be aware of various hematological presentations of DADA2, including ALPS-like disorder, that might lack vasculitis and livedo reticularis to prevent delay in initiating optimal therapy.", "doi": "10.1002/pbc.26912", "title": "Deficiency of ADA2 mimicking autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome in the absence of livedo reticularis and vasculitis.", "journal": ["Pediatric blood & cancer", "Pediatr Blood Cancer"]}
