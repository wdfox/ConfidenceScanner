The 3-minute test may be a solution with positive initial findings. This investigation examined whether a modified 3-minute test (12\u2009\u00d7\u200925\u2005m) could assess CS and supra-CS distance capacity (D') in swimmers. A series of 12\u2009\u00d7\u200925\u2005m intervals were completed unpaced at maximal effort, interspersed with 5\u2005s rest periods. The model speed\u2009=\u2009aebt\u2009+\u2009c was fitted to the data and integrated to calculate D'. The slowest two of the last four efforts were averaged to calculate CS. To assess reliability, 15 highly trained swimmers (9 females, 6 males) completed the 12\u2009\u00d7\u200925\u2005m twice within 72\u2005h. Four measures were deemed reliable: peak velocity (0.01\u2005m\u2005s-1; 0.5%, typical error and % coefficient of variation), CS (0.02\u2005m\u2005s-1; 1.2%), D' (1.22\u2005m; 5.7%) and drop off % (0.70% points; 4.5%). To assess criterion validity, 21 swimmers (9 from reliability, 12 other) completed two competition races within 2 weeks of a 12\u2009\u00d7\u200925\u2005m in the same stroke. Traditional CS and D' measures were calculated from competition performances (TT method). TT CS and 12\u2009\u00d7\u200925\u2005m CS were highly correlated (adj. R2\u2009=\u20090.92, p\u2009<\u2009.001). D' values were moderately correlated (adj. R2\u2009=\u20090.60, p\u2009<\u2009.01). Two TTs may have been too few to estimate D' accurately. The 12\u2009\u00d7\u200925\u2005m all-out swimming test is a reliable method for assessing CS and D' in swimmers, however, the validity of D' requires further investigation.", "doi": "10.1080/17461391.2017.1413138", "title": "Reliability and validity of a modified 3-minute all-out swimming test in elite swimmers.", "journal": ["European journal of sport science", "Eur J Sport Sci"]}
