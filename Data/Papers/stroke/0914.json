This was robust to changes in most structural assumptions and across different subgroups of patients. Probability sensitivity analysis results showed that the probability that LCZ696 is cost-effective at a \u20ac50,000 per QALY threshold is 99.8%, with a population expected value of perfect information of \u20ac297,128. On including indirect medical costs of life-years gained, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was \u20ac26,491 per QALY gained, and LCZ696 was 99.46% cost effective at \u20ac50,000 per QALY, with a population expected value of perfect information of \u20ac2,849,647.LCZ696 is cost effective compared with enalapril under the former and current Dutch guidelines. However, the (monetary) consequences of making a wrong decision were considerably different in both scenarios.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jval.2017.05.013", "title": "Cost Effectiveness of the Angiotensin Receptor Neprilysin Inhibitor Sacubitril/Valsartan for Patients with Chronic Heart Failure and Reduced Ejection Fraction in the Netherlands: A Country Adaptation Analysis Under the Former and Current Dutch Pharmacoeconomic Guidelines.", "journal": ["Value in health : the journal of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research", "Value Health"]}
