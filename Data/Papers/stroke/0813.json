However, it was found that acrolein (CH2=CH-CHO) is more toxic than ROS, and is mainly produced from spermine (SPM), one of the polyamines, rather than from unsaturated fatty acids. Significant amounts of SPM are present normally as SPM-ribosome complexes, and contribute to protein synthesis. However, SPM was released from ribosomes due to the degradation of ribosomal RNA by \u00b7OH or the binding of Ca2+ to ribosomes, and acrolein was produced from free SPM by polyamine oxidases, particularly by SPM oxidase. Acrolein inactivated several proteins such as GAPDH (glycelaldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), and also stimulated MMP-9 (matrix metalloproteinase-9) activity. Acrolein-conjugated GAPDH translocated to nucleus, and caused apoptosis like nitrosylated GAPDH. Through acrolein conjugation with several proteins, acrolein causes tissue damage during brain stroke, dementia, renal failure, and primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome. Thus, development of acrolein scavengers with less side effects is very important to maintain QOL (quality of life) of elderly people.", "doi": "10.1007/s00726-017-2527-x", "title": "Acrolein toxicity at advanced age: present and future.", "journal": ["Amino acids", "Amino Acids"]}
