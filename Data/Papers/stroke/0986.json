In this study, we investigated the potential association of IS-relevant genetic risk factors with cardioembolic stroke (CES) in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients with low CHA2DS2-VaSc score. Genotyping was performed using the GenomeLab SNPstream genotyping platform for five IS-relevant SNPs (MMP-9 C1562T, ALOX5AP SG13S114A/T, MTHFR 677\u2009C/T, FGB 455\u2009G/A, and eNOS G298A) in 479 AF patients with CES and 580 age and sex-matched AF patients without CES. The multivariate analysis adjusted for potential confounders and demonstrated that FGB 455\u2009G/A was independently associated with increased risk of CES in AF patients and the significance remained after Bonferroni correction in the additive, dominant, and recessive models with ORs of 1.548 (95% CI: 1.251-1.915, P\u2009=\u20090.001), 1.588 (95% CI: (1.226-2.057, P\u2009=\u20090.003), and 2.394 (95% CI: 1.357-4.223, P\u2009=\u20090.015), respectively. Plasma fibrinogen levels were significantly higher in patients with the A allele compared with patients with genotype of GG (3.29\u2009\u00b1\u20090.38\u2009mg/dl vs. 2.87\u2009\u00b1\u20090.18\u2009mg/dl, P\u2009<\u20090.001). We found for the first time that the A allele of FGB 455\u2009G/A was a risk factor for CES in AF patients, probably by elevating the level of plasma fibrinogen.", "doi": "10.1038/s41598-017-17537-1", "title": "The \u03b2-fibrinogen gene 455G/A polymorphism associated with cardioembolic stroke in atrial fibrillation with low CHA2DS2-VaSc score.", "journal": ["Scientific reports", "Sci Rep"]}
