We hypothesize that these patients can experience a microembolic genesis of cochleovestibular dysfunction, with a peripheral vestibular syndrome and simultaneous cochlear signs. Hence, we report the first case in literature associating PFO and acute transitory audiovestibular loss, which occurred in a male who had had an ischemic mesencephalic stroke several months ago. The patient's history and duration of the current event of less than 24 hours following complete functional recovery without any damage highlight the vascular cause in cochleovestibular dysfunction and support the existence of a clinical entity that could be named \"cochleovestibular transient ischemic attack\".", "doi": "10.5152/iao.2017.4519", "title": "Cochleovestibular Transient Ischemic Attack as a Manifestation of Patent Foramen Ovale.", "journal": ["The journal of international advanced otology", "J Int Adv Otol"]}
