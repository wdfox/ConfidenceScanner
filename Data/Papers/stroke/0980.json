Cheap and easy-to-use tools have been created to identify sleep quality and sleep disturbances in patients after stroke. This study described the scores of the sleep apnea screening questionnaire - STOP-BANG - in patients after a stroke, and correlated the findings with sleep quality measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The scores of the STOP-BANG and PSQI were 4.3 \u00b1 1.8 and 76 \u00b1 3.9, respectively. The STOP-BANG scores were higher in poor sleepers (4.5 \u00b1 1.6 versus 3.5 \u00b1 1.9; p = 0.032). Logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of subjective sleep quality (PSQI) and the STOP-BANG as a predictor of poor quality sleep, with a relative risk of 1.6, controlled for age and sex. This study indicated that sleep quality was largely influenced by sleep breathing problems, which were well identified by the STOP-BANG, especially in younger stroke patients.", "doi": "10.1590/0004-282X20170137", "title": "The critical influence of nocturnal breathing complaints on the quality of sleep after stroke: the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and STOP-BANG.", "journal": ["Arquivos de neuro-psiquiatria", "Arq Neuropsiquiatr"]}
