He had been treated with warfarin and PT-INR on admission was 2.0. MRI of the head revealed an acute ischemic stroke involving the cerebellum and left occipital lobe. Because transesophageal cardiac echography showed a thrombus in the left atrial appendage, anticoagulant treatment with warfarin and heparin was initiated. The thrombus was enlarging; therefore, we changed the anticoagulant therapy to apixaban with heparin on day 11. On day 17, a hemorrhagic cerebral infarction occurred. After the hemorrhage diminished, we treated him with warfarin aiming for a PT-INR between 3 and 4. The thrombus gradually shrank and disappeared on day 110. Finally, a thoracoscopic left atrial appendectomy was performed as a secondary prevention, with no recurrence till date.", "doi": "10.5692/clinicalneurol.cn-001065", "title": "[A case of cardiogenic embolism, which occurred under appropriate warfarin use, treated with thoracoscopic left atrial appendectomy].", "journal": ["Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology", "Rinsho Shinkeigaku"]}
