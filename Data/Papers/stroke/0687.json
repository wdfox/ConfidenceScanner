We present an unusual case of spontaneous hemopericardium and tamponade in an 87-year-old man with atrial fibrillation who was taking one such agent, dabigatran, as thromboprophylaxis. Our case highlights both a rare bleeding complication of dabigatran use and the effectiveness of idarucizumab, its newly approved reversal agent. Especially in elderly patients, we recommend that clinicians evaluate risk factors, closely monitor patient status, and consider alternatives to the newer anticoagulants when the risk of bleeding is high.", "doi": "10.14503/THIJ-16-6073", "title": "Dabigatran-Induced Spontaneous Hemopericardium and Cardiac Tamponade.", "journal": ["Texas Heart Institute journal", "Tex Heart Inst J"]}
