The patients were examined in respect of demographic features and aortic arch anatomic structure characteristics. All demographic characteristics, DSA, carotid, and vertebral artery stent results were recorded.The patients comprised 60.1% males and 39.9% females with a mean age of 58.25 years. Type 2 aortic arch was found in 175 (60.7%) patients, Type 2 aortic arch in 99 (34.3%) patients, and Type 3 aortic arch in 14 (4.8%) patients. The right carotid artery stenosis rate was found to be higher in patients with Type 2 aortic arch (P=0.013). When the patients were evaluated according to the presence of a bovine arch, there was no significant difference in terms of age, carotid, and vertebral artery lesions (P>0.05).The aortic arch and its branching properties were not found to have a direct effect on increased risk of cerebrovascular disease or stenting rates. This study can be considered to raise awareness for new studies to demonstrate the effect of aortic arch anatomic differences on cerebrovascular diseases.", "doi": "10.2147/NDT.S152194", "title": "The effect of demographic features on aortic arch anatomy and its role in the etiology of cerebrovascular disease.", "journal": ["Neuropsychiatric disease and treatment", "Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat"]}
