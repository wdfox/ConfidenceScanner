The patient were stratified into low, intermediate, and high SYNTAX score groups [\u226422 (n=36), 22-33 (n=42), and \u226533 (n=76)].The mean SYNTAX score was 31\u00b111. Patient demographics and comorbidity were comparable in each group. The prevalence of severe atherosclerosis (Grade \u2265III) in the ascending aorta was 17.5% (n=27) in the whole population and was different in each group with higher prevalence in higher score groups (8.3% vs. 9.5% vs. 26.3%, P=0.018). After adjusting for age, sex and other relevant comorbidity, SYNTAX score remained a predictor of severe atherosclerosis [adjusted OR 1.63, 95% CI: 1.01-2.62, P=0.046 (per 10 point increase); adjusted OR 5.20, 95% CI: 1.15-23.5, P=0.032 (high vs. low score)].SYNTAX score was associated with the severity of atherosclerosis in the ascending aorta. Patients with high scores have a 5 times higher chance of severe disease compared to patients with low scores and should warrant preoperative and intraoperative comprehensive assessment of the ascending aorta.", "doi": "10.21037/jtd.2017.09.17", "title": "SYNTAX score may predict the severity of atherosclerosis of the ascending aorta.", "journal": ["Journal of thoracic disease", "J Thorac Dis"]}
