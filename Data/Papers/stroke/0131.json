Methods: A total of 7 017 participants who completed the carotid sonography examination between 2010 and 2011 were selected from the stroke and the elderly prospective cohort Kailuan study. The participants of stroke cohort received health examination between 2006 and 2007, and participants of elderly cohort received health examination between 2010 and 2011. All participants were divided into plaque group (3 285 cases) and without plaque group (3 732 cases) according to with or without carotid artery plaque.The all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events were compared between the 2 groups. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to identify the association of carotid artery plaque with all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events. Results: (1) There were 4 297 male (61.2%) and 2 720 female (38.8%) in this cohort and participants were (58.1\u00b111.8) years old. Age, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, rates of male, smoking, drinking, history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus were higher in the plaque group than in the without plaque group, and high density lipoprotein cholesterol was lower in the plaque group than in the without plaque group (all P<0.01) at baseline. (2) During a follow-up period of (4.92\u00b10.59) years, the incidence rates of all-cause mortality in the plaque group and without plaque group were 5.5% (180/3 285) and 1.5% (57/3 732) ,respectively (P<0.01) .The incidence rates of cardiovascular events in the plaque group and without plaque group were 3.8% (124/3 285) and 1.4% (52/3 732) , respectively (P<0.01) . (3) Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that carotid plaque was an independent risk factor of all-cause mortality (HR=1.667, 95%CI 1.160-2.395, P<0.01) and cardiovascular events (HR=1.942, 95%CI 1.312-2.876, P<0.01) after adjusting for age, sex, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose, body mass index, total cholesterol,low density lipoprotein cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, drinking, history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, and use of lipid-regulating drugs. Conclusion: Carotid plaque is an independent risk factor of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events.
