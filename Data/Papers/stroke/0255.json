Activated platelets are surrogate markers for DCI occurrence and are reliably represented by mean platelet volume (MPV) to platelet count (PLT) ratio. If validated as a predictor of DCI, the ratio will allow clinicians to use it as a readily available tool in patient management.Retrospective analysis of aSAH patient database at a tertiary care hospital. MPV:PLT ratio was defined as (MPV\u00a0value(fL)PLT\u00a0per\u00a01000\u2217100). Nonlinear regression estimated differences in the ratio's pattern of change over time between those with or without DCI. Receiver operating characteristic curve determined optimal threshold of rise in MPV:PLT ratio to predict DCI.Average age of the cohort (n\u00a0= 169) was 53.0 \u00b1 13.0 years, and 38 patients (22.5%) developed DCI. Nonlinear regression analysis detected a transition of rising and declining MPV:PLT ratio at 3 days after aSAH. Rate of rise in MPV:PLT ratio was 0.5 units/day (95% confidence interval 0.3-0.7) in patients developing DCI as compared with 0.2 units/day (95% confidence interval 0.1-0.3) in those without DCI (P\u00a0= 0.0004). Receiver operating characteristic analysis determined a threshold of 0.33 units/day rise in MPV:PLT predicted DCI with 89.5% sensitivity and 90.8% specificity. Patients who died demonstrated a steeper rise during the first 3 days (0.29 units/day) than those who were discharged home (0.21 units/day) (P\u00a0= 0.004).Trend of MPV:PLT ratio after aSAH predicts DCI.
