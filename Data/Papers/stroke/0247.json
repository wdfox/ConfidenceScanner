To target the issue, a novel emerging acoustic technology, namely ''Quartz Crystal Microbalance with Dissipation'' (QCM-D) has been applied, while the acoustic assays namely ''activated Partial Thromboplastin Time'' (aPTT) and ''Prothrombinase complex-induced Clotting Test'' (PiCT) have been compared with the standard methods in parallel. Both techniques have been applied to 300 samples, including 220 plasma samples of patients suffering coagulation disorders and 80 plasma samples of non-patients. In comparison, the coagulation times of the acoustic aPTT and PiCT yielded an excellent correlation with the standard methods with in analytical standard deviation limits. Finally, the acoustic aPTT assay is the ''gold standard'' for a dose administration of the new oral anticoagulant, where the \u0394f/\u0394\u0393 ratio of the acoustic assay demonstrates that dabigatran with FEIBA 50 combination could be a safe remedy to avoid the deaths in clinics.", "doi": "10.1016/j.bios.2017.12.043", "title": "QCM-D surpassing clinical standard for the dose administration of new oral anticoagulant in the patient of coagulation disorders.", "journal": ["Biosensors & bioelectronics", "Biosens Bioelectron"]}
