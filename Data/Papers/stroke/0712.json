Collateral scores were assessed based on CTP and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) images, respectively. And DSA-CS or CTP-CS 3-4 was defined as good collateral vessels. Good clinical outcome was defined as a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) \u2264 2 at 3 months after stroke. The binary logistic regression model was used to analyze the correlation between the collateral score and clinical outcome, and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to analyze the value of DSA-CS and CTP-CS in predicting the clinical outcome.Among 40 patients, 33 (82.5%) acquired recanalization and 16 (40.0%) got good outcome. Compared with poor outcome group, the collateral score (all P<0.05) and the rate of good collateral vessels were higher in good outcome group (all P<0.01). After adjust baseline National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and onset to recanalization time (ORT), good collateral vessels were independent factor of good outcome (CTP-CS:OR=48.404, 95% CI:1.373-1706.585, P<0.05; DSA-CS:OR=34.651, 95% CI:1.147-1047.018, P<0.05). Collateral scores based on CTP and DSA had good consistency (\u03ba=0.697, P<0.01), and ROC curve showed that the predictive value of CTP-CS and DSA-CS were comparable (both AUC=0.726, 95%CI:0.559-0.893, P<0.05).CTP-CS can predict the clinical outcome of patients with anterior circulation ischemic stroke after thrombectomy.", "doi": null, "title": "[Collateral score based on CT perfusion can predict the prognosis of patients with anterior circulation ischemic stroke after thrombectomy].", "journal": ["Zhejiang da xue xue bao.
