This study aimed to explore the epidemiological association between O\u2083 and risk of ischemic stroke. Ischemic stroke related health data and air pollution data were obtained from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention and Environmental Monitoring Center in Changzhou between 2015 and 2016, respectively. The associations between the short-term exposure to O\u2083 and daily ischemic stroke onsets and deaths were examined based on time-series generalized additive Poisson model. During the study period, daily ischemic stroke onsets and deaths decreased 0.340% (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.559% to -0.120%) and 0.697% (95% CI -1.103% to -0.290%) with an interquartile range (IQR) (41.1 \u00b5g/m\u00b3) increase in levels of ambient O\u2083, respectively. The protective effects of O\u2083 were more significant in men and elders and in the cool season than those in women and young people and in the warm season, respectively. The negative association was independent of PM2.5, PM10, SO\u2082, NO\u2082 or CO exposure. Acute O\u2083 exposure was associated with decreased risk of ischemic stroke. These findings will help provide new insights into the relationship between ischemic stroke and ambient O\u2083 concentrations.", "doi": "10.3390/ijerph14121610", "title": "Protective Effects of Ambient Ozone on Incidence and Outcomes of Ischemic Stroke in Changzhou, China: A Time-Series Study.", "journal": ["International journal of environmental research and public health", "Int J Environ Res Public Health"]}
