In addition, accumulation of amyloid-\u03b2 and neurofibrillary tangles as in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease has been found in the DLB brain. Glial cytoplasmic inclusions are an MSA-specific type of inclusion found in oligodendrocytes and mainly comprise \u03b1-SYN. FK506-binding protein (FKBP) 12 is a member of the immunophilin family with peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity that promotes protein folding and is believed to act as a chaperone protein. Previous in vitro work indicated that FKBP12 accelerated \u03b1-SYN aggregation more than other peptidyl-prolyl isomerases. The enzymatic activity of FKBP12 increases the formation of \u03b1-SYN fibrils at subnanomolar concentrations. In this study, we found that FKBP12 colocalized with \u03b1-SYN in LBs and neurites in PD and DLB brains. Furthermore, FKBP12-immunopositive neurofibrillary tangles colocalized with phosphorylated tau in DLB and FKBP12-immunopositive glial cytoplasmic inclusions colocalized with \u03b1-SYN in MSA. These findings suggest that FKBP12 is linked to the accumulation of \u03b1-SYN and phosphorylated tau protein in \u03b1-synucleinopathies. FKBP12 may play important roles in the pathogenesis of \u03b1-synucleinopathies through its strong aggregation function. Thus, FKBP12 could be an important drug target for \u03b1-synucleinopathies.", "doi": "10.1016/j.brainres.2017.12.012", "title": "FKBP12-immunopositive inclusions in patients with \u03b1-synucleinopathies.", "journal": ["Brain research", "Brain Res."]}
