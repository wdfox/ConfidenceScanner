The objective of this secondary analysis is to investigate the impact of DCM on multifaceted caregivers' burden dimensions by differentiating between objective and subjective burden.A sample of n = 317 dyads of caregivers and community-dwelling people with dementia (PwD) participated in a general practitioner-based, cluster-randomized intervention trial (Identifier:NCT01401582) with two arms and comprehensive data assessment at baseline and 12-month follow-up. Data provided by the caregiver included an inventory with 88 items in 20 different dimensions.Caregivers in the intervention 'DCM' group showed decreased caregiver burden, especially in caregivers' objective burden due to caring (i.e. emotional support), caregivers' subjective burden due to behavior change (i.e. cognition, aggression and resistance, depression, late symptoms) and caregivers' subjective burden due to perceived conflicts between needs and responsibilities to care (i.e. financial losses) compared to caregivers in the control 'care as usual' group, which showed significant increased caregiver burden after 12 months.Our findings support evidence for the effectiveness of DCM to lower family dementia caregivers' burden in multifaceted dimensions.", "doi": "10.1080/13607863.2017.1399341", "title": "Supporting family dementia caregivers: testing the efficacy of dementia care management on multifaceted caregivers' burden.", "journal": ["Aging & mental health", "Aging Ment Health"]}
