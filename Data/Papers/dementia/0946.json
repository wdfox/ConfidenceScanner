Recent studies on abnormal repeat proteins, especially in age-dependent neurodegenerative diseases caused by nucleotide repeat expansion, have highlighted or identified two forms of unconventional translation initiation: usage of AUG-like sites (near cognates) or repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation. We discuss how repeat proteins may differ due to not just unconventional initiation, but also ribosomal frameshifting and/or imperfect repeat DNA replication, expansion, and repair, and we highlight how research on translation of repeats may uncover insights into the biology of translation and its contribution to disease.", "doi": "10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.042", "title": "Rethinking Unconventional Translation in Neurodegeneration.", "journal": ["Cell", "Cell"]}
