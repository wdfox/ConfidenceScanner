For low-income older adults, assistance with such activities, also known as long-term services and supports (LTSS), can also come from Medicaid. These sources of support will be increasingly inadequate as the population ages.To examine the extent of paid and unpaid personal care assistance used by community-residing people who require LTSS; and to analyze how this differs by demographics and the economic status of Medicare beneficiaries.Descriptive analyses of the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS), 2015.Medicare beneficiaries needing LTSS rely predominantly on unpaid care. Hours of unpaid care are not substantially lower when paid care is also received. Findings suggest that public financing of LTSS would not replace but rather supplement the contribution of family and unpaid caregivers to support individuals living independently in the community.", "doi": null, "title": "Use of Paid and Unpaid Personal Help by Medicare Beneficiaries Needing Long-Term Services and Supports.", "journal": ["Issue brief (Commonwealth Fund)", "Issue Brief (Commonw Fund)"]}
