The GFET sensors were fabricated on Si/SiO\u2082 substrate using photolithography with evaporated chromium and sputtered gold contacts. GFET channels were functionalised with a linker molecule to an immobile anti-hCG antibody on the surface of graphene. The binding reaction of the antibody with varying concentration levels of hCG antigen demonstrated the limit of detection of the GFET sensors to be below 1 pg/mL using four-probe electrical measurements. We also show that annealing can significantly improve the carrier transport properties of GFETs and shift the Dirac point (Fermi level) with reduced p-doping in back-gated measurements. The developed GFET biosensors are generic and could find applications in a broad range of medical diagnostics in addition to cancer, such as neurodegenerative (Alzheimer's and Parkinson's ) and cardiovascular disorders.", "doi": "10.3390/diagnostics8010005", "journal": ["Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)", "Diagnostics (Basel)"], "date": "2018-01-18_23:41:10"}
