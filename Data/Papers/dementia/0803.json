Friendships may retain more reciprocal balance than caregiver relationships, which often become one-sided. This qualitative study investigates the meaning that friendship has for people with dementia, and how reciprocity relates to positive social identity. Individuals experiencing dementia were recruited from programs sponsored by a Midwest chapter of The Alzheimer's Association. In a face-to-face, one-time interview, participants were asked to share their perceptions about reciprocal friendship. Participants included 10 individuals who were primarily White, averaged 76 years old, with at least some college education. The data were analyzed using a phenomenological approach that revealed five themes of reciprocal friendship: recognizing the importance of longevity in friendship, helping one another is a normal part of friendship, feeling \"alive\" through the give and take in friendship, knowing somebody is there for them, and seeking security through friendship.", "doi": "10.1177/1471301217742503", "title": "Perceptions of reciprocity in friendship by community dwelling people with mild to moderate dementia.", "journal": ["Dementia (London, England)", "Dementia (London)"]}
