Unfortunately, the aetiology of AD is not completely studied but different factors are associated with the development of AD such as among others low level of acetylcholine, aggregation of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2), hyperphosphorylated tau protein, oxidative stress, and inflammation. The study encompass organic syntheses of 2,3-dihydro-1H-cyclopenta[b]quinoline with 5,6-dichloronicotinic acid and suitable linkers derivatives as multifunctional agents for AD treatment. Afterwards self-induced amyloid beta aggregation, inhibition studies of acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase and molecular docking studies were performed. The results showed that 3b compound exhibited the best acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity, with IC50 value of 0.052\u2009\u00b5M which is lower compared to references. Besides, all synthesised compounds showed good butyrylcholinesterase inhibitory activity with IC50 values from 0.071 to 0.797\u2009\u00b5M. Compound 3b exhibited strong A\u03b21-42 aggregation inhibitory effect with 25.7% at 5\u2009\u00b5M to 92.8% at 100\u2009\u00b5M as well as good anti-inflammatory effect. Thus, new compounds could create new perspectives for further development as a multi-target-directed agent for AD treatment.", "doi": "10.1080/14756366.2017.1406485", "title": "New cyclopentaquinoline hybrids with multifunctional capacities for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.", "journal": ["Journal of enzyme inhibition and medicinal chemistry", "J Enzyme Inhib Med Chem"]}
