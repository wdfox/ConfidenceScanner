We investigated reference region differences between SVaD and Alzheimer's disease (AD) using Centiloid scores. In 57 [C-11] Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) positive (+) AD and 23 PiB (+) SVaD patients, we assessed standardized PiB uptake and Centiloid scores in disease-specific cortical regions, with several reference regions: cerebellar gray (CG), whole cerebellum (WC), WC with brainstem (WC\u2009+\u2009B), pons, and white matter (WM). We calculated disease group differences from young controls (YC) and YC variance according to reference region. SVaD patients showed large effect sizes (Cohen's d\u2009>\u20090.8) using all reference regions. WM and pons showed larger YC variances than other regions. Findings were similar for AD patients. CG, WC, and WC\u2009+\u2009B, but not WM or pons, are reliable reference regions for amyloid imaging analysis in SVaD.", "doi": "10.1038/s41598-017-16236-1", "title": "Centiloid method evaluation for amyloid PET of subcortical vascular dementia.", "journal": ["Scientific reports", "Sci Rep"]}
