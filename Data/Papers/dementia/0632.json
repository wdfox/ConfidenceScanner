Primarily, scientific efforts have focused on the dyshomeostasis between production and clearance of A\u03b242. This imbalance may result from mutations either in genes for the substrate, i.e., amyloid precursor protein or in genes encoding presenilin, the enzyme of the reaction that generates A\u03b242. Currently, it is supposed that soluble oligomers of amyloid beta (A\u03b2Os) and not fibrillar A\u03b242 within neuritic plaques may be the toxic factors acting on a very early stage of AD, perhaps even initiating pathological cascade. For example, soluble A\u03b2Os isolated from AD patients' brains reduced number of synapses, inhibited long-term potentiation, and enhanced long-term synaptic depression in brain regions responsible for memory in animal models of AD. Concentrations of A\u03b2Os in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of AD patients are often reported higher than in non-demented controls, and show a negative correlation with mini-mental state examination scores. Furthermore, increased A\u03b242/oligomer ratio in the CSF of AD/MCI patients indicated that the presence of soluble A\u03b2Os in CSF may be linked to lowering of natively measured monomeric A\u03b242 by epitopes masking, and hence, concentrations of A\u03b2Os in the CSF are postulated to as useful AD biomarkers.", "doi": "10.1007/s00702-017-1820-x", "title": "Amyloid \u03b2 oligomers (A\u03b2Os) in Alzheimer's disease.", "journal": ["Journal of neural transmission (Vienna, Austria : 1996)", "J Neural Transm (Vienna)"]}
