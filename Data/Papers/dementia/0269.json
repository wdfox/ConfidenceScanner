Pooled outcomes as mean difference or odds ratio values with 95% confidence interval were reported. The network estimates with confidence and predictive intervals for all pairwise relative effects was evaluated. Optimal intervention was ranked by benefit-risk ratio based on the surface under the cumulative ranking curve. Eleven eligible RCTs from 9 literatures, including 5141 patients and 5 interventions were included. The quality of evidence was rated low in comparisons. For efficacy, in terms of Mini-Mental State Examination, aducanumab and solanezumab are significantly effective than placebo. For safety, in terms of Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormalities (ARIA), bapineuzumab and aducanumab are significantly worse than placebo.
