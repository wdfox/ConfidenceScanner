This critical review aims to guide clinicians through the use of performance validity tests (PVTs) from test selection and administration through test interpretation and feedback.Recommended cutoffs and relevant test operating characteristics are presented. Other important issues to consider during test selection, administration, interpretation, and feedback are discussed including order effects, coaching, impact on test data, and methods to combine measures and improve predictive power. When interpreting performance validity measures, neuropsychologists must use particular caution in cases of dementia, low intelligence, English as a second language/minority cultures, or low education.PVTs provide valuable information regarding response bias and, under the right circumstances, can provide excellent evidence of response bias. Only after consideration of the entire clinical picture, including validity test performance, can concrete determinations regarding the validity of test data be made.", "doi": "10.1080/13854046.2017.1406146", "title": "Performance validity testing in neuropsychology: a clinical guide, critical review, and update on a rapidly evolving literature.", "journal": ["The Clinical neuropsychologist", "Clin Neuropsychol"]}
