In the pathogenesis of VaD, OS is associated with risk factors that include increased age, hypertension, and stroke. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases (NOXs) are a molecular source of reactive oxygen species (ROS). According to recent studies, inhibition of NOX activity can reduce cognitive impairment in animal models of VaD. In this article, we review the evidence linking cognitive impairment with NOX-dependent OS, including the vascular NOX and non-vascular NOX systems, in VaD.", "doi": "10.3390/ijms18112500", "title": "A Mini-Review of the NADPH oxidases in Vascular Dementia: Correlation with NOXs and Risk Factors for VaD.", "journal": ["International journal of molecular sciences", "Int J Mol Sci"]}
