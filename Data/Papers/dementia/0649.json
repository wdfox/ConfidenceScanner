This makes it unlikely that a single biomarker (e.g. an EEG signal) can be a valid and reliable diagnostic tool in clinical practice. Researchers should be very aware of this heterogeneity, as striving for uniform biomarkers would otherwise result in a considerable waste of research effort. In clinical practice, the delineation of delirium syndrome from dementia and coma using these DSM-5 criteria remains challenging. We state that patient outcomes can probably be improved most by interprofessional, personalised management and the monitoring of vulnerable patients during their individual disease trajectories.", "doi": null, "title": "[Heterogeneity of delirium cannot be captured by a simple diagnostic instrument].", "journal": ["Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde", "Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd"]}
