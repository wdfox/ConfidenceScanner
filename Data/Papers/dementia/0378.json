However, these therapies are rarely tested in human CSF before clinical trials because of the lack of sensitive methods that enable the measurement of aggregate-induced toxicity at low concentrations. We have developed highly sensitive single vesicle and single-cell-based assays that detect the Ca2+ influx caused by the CSF of individuals affected with AD and healthy controls, and we have found comparable effects for both types of samples. We also show that an extracellular chaperone clusterin; a nanobody specific to the amyloid-\u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2); and bapineuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody raised against A\u03b2, could all reduce the Ca2+ influx caused by synthetic A\u03b2 oligomers but are less effective in CSF. These assays could be used to characterize potential therapeutic agents in CSF before clinical trials.", "doi": "10.1016/j.celrep.2017.11.057", "title": "Inhibiting the Ca2+ Influx Induced by Human CSF.", "journal": ["Cell reports", "Cell Rep"]}
