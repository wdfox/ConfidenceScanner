This study aimed at analysing the effects of clinical pharmacists' interventions on use of PIMs, risk of emergency department visits, and time to institutionalization. Furthermore, a descriptive analysis was conducted of circumstances associated with drug-related readmissions. This is a secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled intervention study conducted in two hospitals in Northern Sweden. The study included patients (n = 460) 65 years or older with dementia or cognitive impairment. The intervention consisted of comprehensive medication reviews conducted by clinical pharmacists as part of a healthcare team. There was a larger decrease in PIMs in the intervention group compared with the control group (p = 0.011). No significant difference was found in time to first all-cause emergency department visits (HR = 0.994, 95% CI = 0.755-1.307 p = 0.963, simple Cox regression) or time to institutionalization (HR = 0.761, 95% CI = 0.409-1.416 p = 0.389, simple Cox regression) within 180 days. Common reasons for drug-related readmissions were negative effects of sedatives, opioids, antidepressants, and anticholinergic agents, resulting in confusion, falling, and sedation. Drug-related readmissions were associated with living at home, heart failure, and diabetes. Pharmacist-provided interventions were able to reduce PIMs among elderly people with dementia and cognitive impairment.", "doi": "10.3390/pharmacy6010007", "journal": ["Pharmacy (Basel, Switzerland)", "Pharmacy (Basel)"], "date": "2018-01-18_23:40:37"}
