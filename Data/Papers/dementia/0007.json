She was examined by imaging for progressive cognitive impairment and headache. Enhanced MRI findings showed multiple solid tumors on brain surface, and brain perfusion scintigraphy showed blood flow decrease in both parietal lobes. She was diagnosed with secondary dementia due to leptomeningeal metastases of breast cancer, and whole brain external irradiation was performed(30 Gy/15 Fr).
