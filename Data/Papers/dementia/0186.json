In mild cognitive impairment subjects, study-wide significant association was found with SNPs near ZNF804B for logical memory test of delayed recall scores. We found consistent expression patterns of C14orf40 and MTUS1 in carriers with risk alleles of expression SNPs and in brains of AD patients, compared with in the noncarriers and in brains of controls.Our findings for AD-related brain changes before AD provide insight about early AD-related biological processes.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jalz.2017.11.006", "title": "Genome-wide association study of Alzheimer's disease endophenotypes at prediagnosis stages.", "journal": ["Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association", "Alzheimers Dement"]}
