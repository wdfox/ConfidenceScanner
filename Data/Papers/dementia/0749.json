The exact pathophysiology of this disease remains incompletely understood and safe and effective therapies are required. AD is highly correlated with neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in brain causing neuronal loss. Nuclear factor of activated B-cells (NF-\u03baB) is involved in physiological inflammatory processes and thus representing a promising target for inflammation-based AD therapy. Phytochemicals are able to interfere with the NF-\u03baB pathway. They inhibit the phosphorylation or the ubiquitination of signaling molecules, and thus, inhibit the degradation of I\u03baB. The translocation of NF-\u03baB to the nucleus and subsequent transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines are inhibited by the actions of phytochemicals. Additionally, natural compounds preventing the interaction of NF-\u03baB can block NF-\u03baB's transcriptional activity by inhibiting its binding to target DNA. Many polyphenols including curcumin, resveratrol, pterostilbene, punicalagin, macranthoin G, salidroside, 4-O-methylhonokiol, lycopene, genistein, obovatol and gallic acid were reported as potent NF-\u03baB inhibitors for AD treatment. Several alkaloids such as galantamine, glaucocalyxin B, tetrandrine, berberine, oridonin, anatabine have been shown anti-inflammatory effects in AD models in vitro as well as in vivo. Besides, vitamins, tanshinone IIA, artemisinin, dihydroasparagusic acid, geniposide, xanthoceraside, l-theranine, 1,8-cineole and paeoniflorin were described as promising NF-\u03baB inhibitors. In conclusion, natural products from plants represent interesting candidates for AD treatment. They may qualify as promising compounds for the development of derivatives providing enhanced pharmacological features.", "doi": "10.1016/j.phrs.2017.11.030", "title": "Phytochemicals as inhibitors of NF-\u03baB for treatment of Alzheimer's disease.", "journal": ["Pharmacological research", "Pharmacol.
