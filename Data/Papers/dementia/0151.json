These claims are deeply rooted in the medicalization of death and its appeal to dignity. Drawing from ethnographic fieldwork in nursing homes for people with dementia in The Netherlands, I demonstrate how the end of life with dementia is managed through such moral frames. Specifically, I elaborate on the production of lives (not) worth living and explore how family members welcomed the death of a loved one with dementia. I argue that the welcoming of death is not an act of indifference but can be seen as a form of care.", "doi": "10.1080/07481187.2017.1396644", "title": "Moral frames for lives worth living: Managing the end of life with dementia.", "journal": ["Death studies", "Death Stud"]}
