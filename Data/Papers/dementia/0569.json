Dementia was defined as a self-reported or proxy-reported physician's diagnosis of the disease.Regular exercise and potential confounding variables were obtained via a self-report questionnaire. We generated longitudinal logistic regression models based on time-lagged generalised estimating equation to examine the causal association between exercise and dementia risk.Of the 7501 older Chinese people included in this study, 338 developed dementia during the 9-year follow-up period after excluding those who were lost to follow-up or deceased. People who regularly exercised had lower odds of developing dementia (OR=0.53, 95% CI 0.33\u2009to 0.85) than those who did not exercise regularly.Regular exercise was associated with decreased risk of dementia. Policy-makers should develop effective public health programmes and build exercise-friendly environments for the general public.", "doi": "10.1136/bmjopen-2017-017497", "title": "Association between exercise and the risk of dementia: results from a nationwide longitudinal study in China.", "journal": ["BMJ open", "BMJ Open"]}
