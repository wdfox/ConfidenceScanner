Currently, no disease-modifying treatments are available for these disorders. Previous preclinical studies demonstrate that active and passive immunizations targeting \u03b1-syn partially ameliorate behavioral deficits and \u03b1-syn accumulation; however, it is unknown whether combining humoral and cellular immunization might act synergistically to reduce inflammation and improve microglial-mediated \u03b1-syn clearance. Since combined delivery of antigen plus rapamycin (RAP) in nanoparticles is known to induce antigen-specific regulatory T cells (Tregs), we adapted this approach to \u03b1-syn using the antigen-presenting cell-targeting glucan microparticle (GP) vaccine delivery system. PDGF-\u03b1-syn transgenic (tg) male and female mice were immunized with GP-alone, GP-\u03b1-syn (active humoral immunization), GP+RAP, or GP+RAP/\u03b1-syn (combined active humoral and Treg) and analyzed using neuropathological and biochemical markers. Active immunization resulted in higher serological total IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a anti-\u03b1-syn levels. Compared with mice immunized with GP-alone or GP-\u03b1-syn, mice vaccinated with GP+RAP or GP+RAP/\u03b1-syn displayed increased numbers of CD25-, FoxP3-, and CD4-positive cells in the CNS. GP-\u03b1-syn or GP+RAP/\u03b1-syn immunizations resulted in a 30-45% reduction in \u03b1-syn accumulation, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration. Mice immunized with GP+RAP/\u03b1-syn further rescued neurons and reduced neuroinflammation. Levels of TGF-\u03b21 were increased with GP+RAP/\u03b1-syn immunization, while levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 were reduced. We conclude that the observed effects of GP+RAP/\u03b1-syn immunization support the hypothesis that cellular immunization may enhance the effects of active immunotherapy for the treatment of synucleinopathies.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT We show that a novel vaccination modality combining an antigen-presenting cell-targeting glucan particle (GP) vaccine delivery system with encapsulated antigen (\u03b1-synuclein) + rapamycin (RAP) induced both strong anti-\u03b1-synuclein antibody titers and regulatory T cells (Tregs). This vaccine, collectively termed GP+RAP/\u03b1-syn, is capable of triggering neuroprotective Treg responses in synucleinopathy models, and the combined vaccine is more effective than the humoral or cellular immunization alone. Together, these results support the further development of this multifunctional vaccine approach for the treatment of synucleinopathies, such as Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple systems atrophy.", "doi": "10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1170-17.2017", "title": "Combined Active Humoral and Cellular Immunization Approaches for the Treatment of Synucleinopathies.", "journal": ["The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "J.
