Thus, we compared the accumulation of N-terminally truncated amyloid-\u03b2 and full-length amyloid-\u03b2, depending on disease stage as well as brain area, and determined how these amyloid-\u03b2 species respectively correlate with clinicopathological features of Alzheimer's disease. To this end, the amounts of amyloid-\u03b2 species and other proteins related to amyloid-\u03b2 metabolism or Alzheimer's disease were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) or theoretically calculated in 12 brain regions, including neocortical, limbic and subcortical areas from Alzheimer's disease cases (n = 19), neurologically normal elderly without amyloid-\u03b2 accumulation (normal ageing, n = 13), and neurologically normal elderly with cortical amyloid-\u03b2 accumulation (pathological ageing, n = 15). We observed that N-terminally truncated amyloid-\u03b242 and full-length amyloid-\u03b242 accumulations distributed differently across disease stages and brain areas, while N-terminally truncated amyloid-\u03b240 and full-length amyloid-\u03b240 accumulation showed an almost identical distribution pattern. Cortical N-terminally truncated amyloid-\u03b242 accumulation was increased in Alzheimer's disease compared to pathological ageing, whereas cortical full-length amyloid-\u03b242 accumulation was comparable between Alzheimer's disease and pathological ageing. Moreover, N-terminally truncated amyloid-\u03b242 were more likely to accumulate more in specific brain areas, especially some limbic areas, while full-length amyloid-\u03b242 tended to accumulate more in several neocortical areas, including frontal cortices. Immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry analysis showed that several N-terminally truncated amyloid-\u03b242 species, represented by pyroglutamylated amyloid-\u03b211-42, were enriched in these areas, consistent with ELISA results. N-terminally truncated amyloid-\u03b242 accumulation showed significant regional association with BACE1 and neprilysin, but not PSD95 that regionally associated with full-length amyloid-\u03b242 accumulation. Interestingly, accumulations of tau and to a greater extent apolipoprotein E (apoE, encoded by APOE) were more strongly correlated with N-terminally truncated amyloid-\u03b242 accumulation than those of other amyloid-\u03b2 species across brain areas and disease stages. Consistently, immunohistochemical staining and in vitro binding assays showed that apoE co-localized and bound more strongly with pyroglutamylated amyloid-\u03b211-x fibrils than full-length amyloid-\u03b2 fibrils. Retrospective review of clinical records showed that accumulation of N-terminally truncated amyloid-\u03b242 in cortical areas was associated with disease onset, duration and cognitive scores. Collectively, N-terminally truncated amyloid-\u03b242 species have spatiotemporal accumulation patterns distinct from full-length amyloid-\u03b242, likely due to different mechanisms governing their accumulations in the brain. These truncated amyloid-\u03b2 species could play critical roles in the disease by linking other clinicopathological features of Alzheimer's disease.", "doi": "10.1093/brain/awx284", "title": "Distinct spatiotemporal accumulation of N-truncated and full-length amyloid-\u03b242 in Alzheimer's disease.", "journal": ["Brain : a journal of neurology", "Brain"]}
