One year post-evaluative survey with a subset showed outreach to an average of 15-25 community members, indicating positive reception of this new information.CPBR model is a successful education and outreach tool with Latino communities. Our Dementia Awareness Campaign was a success with the first 20 Promotoras trained; at present we plan to train additional groups in nearby communities with significant Hispanic/Latino populations.In order to get Latinos to seek early detection, we need to first educate them about dementia, win trust, and encourage treatment-seeking. Early intervention, diagnosis, and prevention will benefit from educational campaigns using the CBPR model.", "doi": "10.1080/07317115.2017.1398799", "title": "Dementia Awareness Campaign in the Latino Community: A Novel Community Engagement Pilot Training Program with Promotoras.", "journal": ["Clinical gerontologist", "Clin Gerontol"]}
