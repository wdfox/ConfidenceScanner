We aimed to determine the role of supplementary examinations, except for biomarkers, on diagnostic stability of dementia over time and to identify reversible dementias.We identified 432 patients with dementia who performed 2 clinical evaluations and the supplementary examinations recommended by the American Academy of Neurology in a follow-up period of 1 year.In this sample, 110 (24.5%) patients changed their diagnosis at 1-year follow-up for the appearance of vascular cognitive impairment than the initial diagnosis, due to the neuroimaging. Concerning the reversible dementias, depression was the major differential diagnosis, detected in 13 (81%) of the 16 patients with cognitive improvement.Therefore, regarding the supplementary examinations only neuroimaging and the depression triage were relevant for clinical practice regarding the differential diagnosis of dementia.", "doi": "10.1177/1533317517744060", "title": "The Contribution of Supplementary Tests in the Differential Diagnosis of Dementia.", "journal": ["American journal of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias", "Am J Alzheimers Dis Other Demen"]}
