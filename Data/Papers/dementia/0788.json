The role of the SLT in palliative care is difficult to define. Much is known about the clinical aspects of this role; however, little is known about the core values, beliefs and expectations of SLTs working in this sector, particularly with regard to their role in supporting patients' communication. Through a series of semi-structured interviews and a follow-up focus group, this report aimed to form a picture of the experiences and views of SLTs about their communication role in palliative care. Results suggest that SLTs are forging a self-identity in a sector that is itself constantly evolving, which causes difficulties in defining their role. Participants report that other health professionals have a poor understanding of the SLT's role. SLTs may benefit from palliative care-specific guidelines and increased interprofessional awareness of their role in order to become better integrated into the palliative care sector.", "doi": "10.12968/ijpn.2017.23.11.543", "title": "Communication disorders in palliative care: investigating the views, attitudes and beliefs of speech and language therapists.", "journal": ["International journal of palliative nursing", "Int J Palliat Nurs"]}
