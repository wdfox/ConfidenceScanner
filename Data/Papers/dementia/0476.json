Changes after the CSF tap test in stride time variability (STV, %) were our main outcome. CSF Alzheimer's disease biomarkers, cerebrovascular white matter changes assessed with brain imaging and neurodegenerative diseases with parkinsonian syndrome represented the three individual brain comorbidities.Brain comorbidities were frequently identified, NPH+ patients representing 40 patients of our sample (76.9%). NPH- patients improved their STV better in the single task (delta of STV = -58.6% \u00b1 54.3% vs. -14.1% \u00b1 62.0%; P = 0.031) and in the dual task (delta of STV =-32.2% \u00b1 33.7% vs. 6.3% \u00b1 58.4%; P = 0.028) after the CSF tap test than NPH+ patients. Amongst NPH+ individuals, only comorbid Alzheimer's disease was associated with STV increase (i.e. deterioration of gait) in the dual task [\u03b2 38.4; 95% confidence interval (5.64; 71.24); P = 0.023] after the CSF tap test, whilst it was borderline in the single task [\u03b2 35.0; 95% confidence interval (-1.97; 71.90); P = 0.063].Brain comorbidities affect gait improvement after the CSF tap test in NPH patients; this influence is driven by Alzheimer's disease-related pathology.", "doi": "10.1111/ene.13543", "title": "Brain comorbidities in normal pressure hydrocephalus.", "journal": ["European journal of neurology", "Eur.
