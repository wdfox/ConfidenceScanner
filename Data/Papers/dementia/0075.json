Research regarding family caregivers suggests normalization as a model for coping with negative emotional outcomes in caring for a person with dementia (PWD). The study aims to explore whether normalization coping mechanism exists among formal caregivers, reveal differences in its application among cross-cultural caregivers, and examine how this coping mechanism may be related to implementing person-centered care for PWDs.Content analysis of interviews with 20 formal caregivers from three cultural groups (Jews born in Israel [JI], Arabs born in Israel [AI], Russian immigrants [RI]), attending to PWDs.We extracted five normalization modes, revealing AI caregivers had substantially more utterances of normalization expressions than their colleagues.The normalization modes most commonly expressed by AI caregivers relate to the personhood of PWDs. These normalization modes may enhance formal caregivers' ability to employ person-centered care.", "doi": "10.1177/1043659617745137", "title": "\"I Treat Him as a Normal Patient\": Unveiling the Normalization Coping Strategy Among Formal Caregivers of Persons With Dementia and Its Implications for Person-Centered Care.", "journal": ["Journal of transcultural nursing : official journal of the Transcultural Nursing Society", "J Transcult Nurs"]}
