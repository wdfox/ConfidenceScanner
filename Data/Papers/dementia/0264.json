To elucidate this association in the elderly, we measured subcortical gray matter volume and correlated this with volumes to exercise habits in a community-based cohort study in Japan.Subjects without mild cognitive impairment or dementia (n\u00a0=\u00a0280, 35% male, mean age 73.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.9\u00a0years) were evaluated using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), an exercise habit questionnaire, and brain magnetic resonance imaging. Subcortical gray matter volume was compared between groups based on the presence/absence of exercise habits. The MMSE was re-administered 3\u00a0years after the baseline examination.Ninety-one subjects (32.5%) reported exercise habits (exercise group), and 189 subjects (67.5%) reported no exercise habits (non-exercise group). Volumetric analysis revealed that the volumes in the exercise group were greater in the left hippocampus (p\u00a0=\u00a00.042) and bilateral nucleus accumbens (left, p\u00a0=\u00a00.047; right, p\u00a0=\u00a00.007) compared to those of the non-exercise group. Among the 195 subjects who received a follow-up MMSE examination, the normalized intra-cranial volumes of the left nucleus accumbens (p\u00a0=\u00a00.004) and right amygdala (p\u00a0=\u00a00.014)showed significant association with a decline in the follow-up MMSE score.Subjects with exercise habits show larger subcortical gray matter volumes than subjects without exercise habits in community-dwelling elderly subjects in Japan. Specifically, the volume of the nucleus accumbens correlates with both exercise habits and cognitive preservation.", "doi": "10.1016/j.ensci.2017.03.002", "title": "Association between exercise habits and subcortical gray matter volumes in healthy elderly people: A population-based study in Japan.", "journal": ["eNeurologicalSci", "eNeurologicalSci"]}
