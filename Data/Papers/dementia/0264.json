Autonomic dysfunction in these disorders results from variable involvement of the central and peripheral autonomic networks. The major pathologic hallmark of Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies is Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites; of multiple system atrophy, oligodendroglial cytoplasmic inclusions; and of pure autonomic failure, peripheral neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions. Clinical manifestations include orthostatic hypotension, thermoregulatory dysfunction, gastrointestinal dysmotility, and urogenital dysfunction with neurogenic bladder and sexual dysfunction. Strong evidence supports isolated idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep disorder as a significant risk factor for the eventual development of synucleinopathies with autonomic and/or motor involvement. In contrast, some neurologically normal elderly individuals have Lewy-related pathology. Future work may reveal protective or vulnerability factors that allow some patients to harbor Lewy pathology without overt autonomic dysfunction. \u00a9 2018 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.", "doi": "10.1002/mds.27186", "journal": ["Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "Mov.
