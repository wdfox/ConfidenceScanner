Descriptive analysis was used to characterize the final sample (n\u2009=\u2009436). The study protocol as well as the methodological procedure to obtain the referral of research participants and data collection on the condition of people with probable dementia in Primary Health Care proved to be a valuable tool to obtain a sample of patients distributed by the full range of probable dementia in a large geographical area. Results may allocate the design of care pathways for old people with cognitive disorders to prevent, delay impairment, and/or optimize quality of life of patients.", "doi": "10.3389/fmed.2017.00197", "title": "Screening of Dementia in Portuguese Primary Care: Methodology, Assessment Tools, and Main Results.", "journal": ["Frontiers in medicine", "Front Med (Lausanne)"]}
