The OLTT required participants to recall the location of objects under free and cued recall conditions, with accuracy evaluated using distance measures (i.e., a continuous error score), and a standard recognition format. Correlations between performance and volumetric data were evaluated from a subset of 77 participants.Significant age effects were dwarfed by MCI effects across all test conditions. OLTT Cued Recall was strongly and specifically related to the volume of disease-relevant medial temporal lobe regions, generally more than traditional memory tests.The OLTT may be sensitive to early structural compromise in regions affected by Alzheimer's disease.", "doi": "10.1016/j.dadm.2017.10.007", "title": "Continuous measurement of object location memory is sensitive to effects of age and mild cognitive impairment and related to medial temporal lobe volume.", "journal": ["Alzheimer's & dementia (Amsterdam, Netherlands)", "Alzheimers Dement (Amst)"]}
