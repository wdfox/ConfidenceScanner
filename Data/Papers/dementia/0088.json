Published randomized controlled trials were comprehensively reviewed from electronic databases (Cochrane library, Embase, Pubmed, and Google scholar). Pooled outcomes as mean difference or odds ratio values with 95% confidence interval were reported. The network estimates with confidence and predictive intervals for all pairwise relative effects was evaluated. Optimal intervention was ranked by benefit-risk ratio based on the surface under the cumulative ranking curve. Eleven eligible RCTs from 9 literatures, including 5141 patients and 5 interventions were included. The quality of evidence was rated low in comparisons. For efficacy, in terms of Mini-Mental State Examination, aducanumab and solanezumab are significantly effective than placebo. For safety, in terms of Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormalities (ARIA), bapineuzumab and aducanumab are significantly worse than placebo. There were no significant differences in outcomes of Alzheimer's disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale, Disability Assessment for Dementia, Adverse Events, and mortality. Given the clinical therapeutic effects of anti-A\u03b2 immunotherapies for AD, aducanumab and solanezumab improve the cognitive function, while aducanumab and bapineuzumab may increase the risks of ARIA.", "doi": "10.1002/acn3.469", "title": "Efficacy and safety of anti-amyloid-\u03b2 immunotherapy for Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.", "journal": ["Annals of clinical and translational neurology", "Ann Clin Transl Neurol"]}
