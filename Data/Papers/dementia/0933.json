The similarity of the renal and cerebral small vessels has awakened a surge of studies suggesting that CysC plays a key role in various cerebrovascular disorders. This review focuses on four major mechanisms of CysC in a variety of cerebrovascular diseases. (1)The property of the CysC Leu-68-Gln (L68Q) variant to aggregate and the property of the wild type CysC protein to co-aggregate with Amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2); (2)The disruption of equilibrium between CysC and related cysteine proteases; (3)The function of CysC as an inflammatory inducing factor; (4)The ability of CysC to induce autophagy. The combination of these CysC properties provide a well-supported novel biomarker for cerebrovascular diseases.", "doi": "10.2174/1567202614666171116102504", "title": "Cystatin C in Cerebrovascular Disorders.", "journal": ["Current neurovascular research", "Curr Neurovasc Res"]}
