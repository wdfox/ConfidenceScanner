We hypothesized that scores from the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 (SF-36) would be higher during continuation treatment in the \"STABLE\u00a0+\u00a0PHARM\" group versus the \"PHARM\" group. The overall study design was called \"Prolonging Remission in Depressed Elderly\" (PRIDE). Remitters to the acute course of ECT were re-consented to enter a 6 month RCT of \"STABLE\u00a0+\u00a0PHARM\" versus \"PHARM\". Measures of depressive symptoms and cognitive function were completed by blind raters; SF-36 measurements were patient self-report every 4 weeks. Participants were 120 patients >60 years old. Patients with dementia, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or substance abuse were excluded. The \"PHARM\" group received venlafaxine and lithium. The \"STABLE\u00a0+\u00a0PHARM\" received the same medications, plus 4 weekly outpatient ECT sessions, with additional ECT session as needed. Participants were mostly female (61.7%) with a mean age of 70.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.2 years. \"STABLE\u00a0+\u00a0PHARM\" patients received 4.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.5 ECT sessions during Phase 2. \"STABLE\u00a0+\u00a0PHARM\" group had 7 point advantage (3.5-10.4, 95% CI) for Physical Component Score of SF-36 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), and 8.2 point advantage (4.2-12.2, 95% CI) for Mental Component Score (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Additional ECT resulted in overall net health benefit. Consideration should be given to administration of additional ECT to prevent relapse during the continuation phase of treatment of MDD.
