The previous attending physician noticed remarkable left dominant frontotemporal lobe atrophy on cranial MRI. Her dysarthria, dysphagia and the muscle weakness of her extremities worsened, and a muscle biopsy revealed mitochondrial abnormality. The mitochondrial DNA from her muscle showed multiple deletions; the previous physician therefore diagnosed the patient with mitochondrial disease. The patient resembled amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-frontotemporal dementia (ALS-FTD). No other cases of ALS-FTD with mitochondrial disease have been reported in Japan. We therefore consider the present case to be valuable.", "doi": "10.5692/clinicalneurol.cn-001071", "title": "[A case of mitochondrial disease with multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions suspected amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-frontotemporal dementia].", "journal": ["Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology", "Rinsho Shinkeigaku"]}
