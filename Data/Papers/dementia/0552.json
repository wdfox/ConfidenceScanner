The Mini-Mental State Examination, the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), and the Global Deterioration Scale results were analyzed.By comparing EOAD (n = 35) and LOAD (n = 35) patients, no significant differences were found in clinical or demographic variables, matched for sex, education, and disease severity. There were no differences between groups in total NPI frequency or severity scores. The most common NPS were irritability, apathy, anxiety, and depression. We found an association of NPI scores with disease severity and duration, which was more specific in patients with LOAD and was also associated with the presence of delusions and hallucinations.Despite subtle differences, NPS is considered important in the assessment of patients with AD, regardless of the age of onset.", "doi": "10.1177/1533317517744061", "title": "Neuropsychiatric Profile in Early Versus Late Onset Alzheimer's Disease.", "journal": ["American journal of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias", "Am J Alzheimers Dis Other Demen"]}
