We then measured the plasma levels of a panel of metabolic products of KYN pathway in an independent validation cohort including 118 PD patients, 22 Huntington's disease (HD) patients, and 37 NCs. Lower kynurenic acid (KA)/KYN ratio, higher quinolinic acid (QA) level, and QA/KA ratio were observed in PD patients compared to HD patients and NCs. PD patients at advanced stage (Hoehn-Yahr stage >\u20092) showed lower KA and KA/KYN ratio, as well as higher QA and QA/KA ratio compared to PD patients at early stage (Hoehn-Yahr stage \u2264\u20092) and NCs. Levels of KA and QA, as well as the ratios of KA/KYN and QA/KA between PD patients with and without psychiatric symptoms, dementia, or levodopa-induced dyskinesia in the advanced PD were similar.
