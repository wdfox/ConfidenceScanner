This review summarizes the features and recent progress of CCCI, mainly focusing on epidemiology, experimental research, pathophysiology, etiology, clinical manifestations, imaging presentation, diagnosis, and potential therapeutic regimens. Some research directions are briefly discussed as well.", "doi": "10.1111/cns.12780", "title": "Advances in chronic cerebral circulation insufficiency.", "journal": ["CNS neuroscience & therapeutics", "CNS Neurosci Ther"]}
