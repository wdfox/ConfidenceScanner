Lanabecestat is a brain-permeable oral inhibitor of human beta-site amyloid (A\u03b2) precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) that reduces A\u03b2 production. As a potent BACE1 inhibitor, lanabecestat significantly reduced soluble A\u03b2 species and soluble amyloid precursor proteins (sAPP\u03b2) in mouse, guinea pig, and dog in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Significant reductions in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A\u03b21-40 and A\u03b21-42 were observed in Phase 1 studies of healthy subjects and AD patients treated with lanabecestat. Three lanabecestat trials are ongoing and intended to support registration in Early AD: (1) Phase 2/3 study in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD and mild AD dementia (AMARANTH, NCT02245737); (2) Delayed-start extension study (AMARANTH-EXTENSION, NCT02972658) for patients who have completed treatment in the AMARANTH Study; and (3) Phase 3 study in mild AD dementia (DAYBREAK-ALZ, NCT02783573). This review will discuss the development of lanabecestat, results from the completed nonclinical and clinical studies, as well as describe the ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials.", "doi": "10.14283/jpad.2017.38", "title": "Development Review of the BACE1 Inhibitor Lanabecestat (AZD3293/LY3314814).", "journal": ["The journal of prevention of Alzheimer's disease", "J Prev Alzheimers Dis"]}
