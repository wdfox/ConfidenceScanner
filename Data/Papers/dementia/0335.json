We explored the possibility of therapeutic approach by repurposing of tramadol in a sporadic animal model of Alzheimer's type. Streptozocin (STZ 3\u00a0mg/kg; bilaterally) was injected to male SD rats through intracerebroventricular (ICV) route. Drug treatment was started just after streptozocin administration and continued for 3\u00a0weeks. The rats were killed on the 21st day following the last behavioral test, and cytoplasmic fractions of the hippocampus and pre-frontal cortex were prepared for the quantification of acetylcholinesterase, oxidative stress parameter, mitochondrial enzymes activity and histological examination. Tramadol (5, 10 and 20\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.) was used as a treatment drug, and memantine (10\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.) was used as a standard. Tramadol significantly attenuated behavioral, biochemical, mitochondrial and histological alterations at low (5\u00a0mg/kg) and intermediate (10\u00a0mg/kg) dose, suggesting its neuroprotective potential in ICV-STZ-treated rats. Further, the neuroprotective effect of tramadol (10\u00a0mg/kg) was comparable to memantine (10\u00a0mg/kg). In conclusion, our results indicate the effectiveness of tramadol in preventing ICV-STZ-induced cognitive impairment as well as mito-oxidative stress. Further, these findings reveal the possibility of MOR agonist as a therapeutic approach for sporadic Alzheimer disease.", "doi": "10.1007/s10787-017-0431-3", "title": "Tramadol ameliorates behavioural, biochemical, mitochondrial and histological alterations in ICV-STZ-induced sporadic dementia of Alzheimer's type in rats.", "journal": ["Inflammopharmacology", "Inflammopharmacology"]}
