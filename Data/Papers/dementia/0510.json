Previous studies suggest that reduction of apoE levels through genetic manipulation can reduce A\u03b2 pathology. However, it is not clear how reduction of apoE levels after birth would affect amyloid deposition. We utilize an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) to reduce apoE expression in the brains of APP/PS1-21 mice homozygous for the APOE-\u03b54 or APOE-\u03b53 allele. ASO treatment starting after birth led to a significant decrease in A\u03b2 pathology when assessed at 4\u00a0months. Interestingly, ASO treatment starting at the onset of amyloid deposition led to an increase in A\u03b2 plaque size and a reduction in plaque-associated neuritic dystrophy with no change in overall plaque load. These results suggest that lowering apoE levels prior to plaque deposition can strongly affect the initiation of A\u03b2 pathology while lowering apoE after A\u03b2 seeding modulates plaque size and toxicity.", "doi": "10.1016/j.neuron.2017.11.014", "title": "Age-Dependent Effects of apoE Reduction Using Antisense Oligonucleotides in a Model of \u03b2-amyloidosis.", "journal": ["Neuron", "Neuron"]}
