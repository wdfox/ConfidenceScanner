Its abnormal aggregation and accumulation in nerve tissue are said to cause neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Lewy body dementia, and multiple-system atrophy. This study (part of this study was presented at the 137th Annual Meeting of the Pharmaceutical Society of Japan) examined the effects of saffron, its constituents (crocin-1, crocin-2, crocetin, and safranal), and crocetin structural analogs (hexadecanedioic acid, norbixin, and trans, trans-muconic acid) on \u03b1S aggregation, and \u03b1S fibril dissociation. Saffron dose-dependently inhibited \u03b1S aggregation and dissociated \u03b1S fibrils by thioflavin T fluorescence assay. These effects were observed by transmission electron microscopy, which showed reduced and shortened \u03b1S fibrils. Crocin-1, crocin-2, and crocetin showed anti-aggregation and fibril dissociation effects, with crocetin being the most potent. The effects of norbixin were weaker than those of crocetin, and the other crocetin structural analogs showed no effects. These results show that saffron and its constituents (crocin-1, crocin-2, and crocetin) can be effective in preventing and treating diseases caused by abnormal \u03b1S aggregation.", "doi": "10.1007/s11418-017-1150-1", "title": "Effects of saffron\u00a0and its constituents,\u00a0crocin-1, crocin-2, and crocetin on \u03b1-synuclein fibrils.", "journal": ["Journal of natural medicines", "J Nat Med"]}
