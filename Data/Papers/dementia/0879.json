Apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4), the most prevalent genetic risk factor for AD, also increases the risk for dementia in pure synucleinopathies. We presently examined the effects of \u03b1-synuclein deficiency (\u03b1-syn-/-) and sex on apoE4-driven pathologies.AD-related, synaptic, and vascular markers were analyzed in female and male \u03b1-syn-/- and \u03b1-syn+/+ apoE4, apoE3, and apoE3/E4 mice.ApoE4 was hypolipidated, and this effect was unchanged by \u03b1-syn-/- and sex. The levels of synaptic markers were lower, and the levels of AD-related parameters were higher in female \u03b1-syn-/- apoE4 mice compared with the corresponding apoE3 mice. By comparison, apoE4 had small effects on the AD parameters of male and female \u03b1-syn+/+ apoE4 mice.Although \u03b1-syn-/- does not affect the upstream lipidation impairment of apoE4, it acts as a \"second hit\" enhancer of the subsequent apoE4-driven pathologies.", "doi": "10.1016/j.dadm.2017.08.003", "title": "The effects of apolipoprotein E genotype, \u03b1-synuclein deficiency, and sex on brain synaptic and Alzheimer's disease-related pathology.", "journal": ["Alzheimer's & dementia (Amsterdam, Netherlands)", "Alzheimers Dement (Amst)"]}
