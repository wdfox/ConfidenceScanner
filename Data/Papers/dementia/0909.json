Currently used therapeutic agents to treat CNS diseases exhibit significant efficacy. However, the inability of these drugs to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and invasiveness of the technologies to achieve localized drug delivery in disease-specific parts of the brain have thwarted pain-free and complete treatment of CNS diseases. Therefore, the safe, non-invasive, and targeted delivery of drugs to the brain using nanoparticles (NPs) is currently receiving considerable research attention. Here, we highlight advances in state-of-the-art personalized nanomedicine for the treatment of CNS diseases (with a focus on dementia), the related challenges, possible solutions, and prospects for nano-enabled personalized medicine.", "doi": "10.1016/j.drudis.2017.11.010", "title": "Personalized nanomedicine for CNS diseases.", "journal": ["Drug discovery today", "Drug Discov.
