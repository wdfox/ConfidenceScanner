Its common symptoms arise in the digestive system, however, during the infection the CNS (Central Nervous System) may also be affected.The aim of this work is to present a case report of a patient diagnosed with Whipple's disease with dominant neuropsychological and behavioural complications in the late phase.Whipple's disease is a rare disease with possible neurological and neuropsychiatric complications. Neurological disorders (eye movement disorders, myoclonus, oculoskeletal miorhythmia, progressive dementia) may develop in spite of correct pharmacological treatment. Apart from its classical symptoms, unspecified cognitive function disorders and autonomic nervous system disorders may develop. Providing right antibiotic treatment may not always lead to complete remission or prevent neuropsychiatric complications. However, early diagnosis and clinical alertnessallow to administer right treatment and improve further prognosis.", "doi": "10.12740/PP/OnlineFirst/61131", "title": "Neurological and neuropsychological complications in the course of chronic Whipple's disease - case report.", "journal": ["Psychiatria polska", "Psychiatr.
