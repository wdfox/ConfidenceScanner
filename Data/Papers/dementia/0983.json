A significant improvement in BPSD was seen with: functional analysis-based interventions (GRADE quality of evidence moderate; standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.10, 95%CI -0.20 to 0.00), music therapy (low; SMD -0.49, 95%CI -0.82 to -0.17), analgesics (low; SMD -0.24, 95%CI -0.47 to -0.01), donepezil (high; SMD -0.15 95% CI -0.29 to -0.01), galantamine (high; SMD -0.15, 95%CI -0.28 to -0.03), and antipsychotics (high; SMD -0.13, 95%CI -0.21 to -0.06). The estimate of effect size for most interventions was small.Although some pharmacological interventions had a slightly larger effect size, current evidence suggests functional analysis-based interventions should be used as first line management of BPSD whenever possible due to the lack of associated adverse events. Music therapy may also be beneficial, but further research is required as the quality of evidence to support its use is low. Cholinesterase inhibitors donepezil and galantamine should be trialled for the management of BPSD where non-pharmacological treatments have failed. Low-quality evidence suggests that assessment of pain should be conducted and a stepped analgesic approach trialled when appropriate. Antipsychotics have proven effectiveness but should be avoided where possible due to the high risk of serious adverse events and availability of safer alternatives.", "doi": "10.1017/S1041610217002344", "title": "An overview of systematic reviews of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for the treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia.", "journal": ["International psychogeriatrics", "Int Psychogeriatr"]}
