Most studies were assessed as of medium to low quality using Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD) guidance.The findings of excellent diagnostic accuracy are compromised by the methodological limitations of studies. While studies generally reported excellent diagnostic accuracy across and within different languages, optimal cut-offs even within particular language versions, varied.There is a need for future research to address these limitations through adherence to STARD guidelines. The ACE-III is particularly under-evaluated and should be a focus of future research. The variance in obtained optimal cut-offs within language versions is an issue compromising clinical utility and could be addressed in future work through use of a-priori defined thresholds.", "doi": "10.1080/13607863.2017.1411882", "title": "Systematic review of the diagnostic accuracy of the non-English versions of Addenbrooke's cognitive examination\u00a0-\u00a0revised and III.", "journal": ["Aging & mental health", "Aging Ment Health"]}
