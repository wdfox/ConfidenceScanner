However, there is still seldom information on the type of rTMS protocols that deliver the best clinical improvement in AD. Objetive: To compare the clinical response between a simple stimulation protocol on the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (lDLPFC) against a complex protocol using six regions of interest.19 participants were randomized to receive any of the protocols. The analysis of repeated measures evaluated the change.Both protocols were equally proficient at improving cognitive function, behavior and functionality after 3 weeks of treatment, and the effects were maintained for 4 weeks more without treatment.We suggest rTMS on the lDLPFC could be enough to provide a clinical response, and the underlying mechanisms should be studied.", "doi": "10.1016/j.brs.2017.12.011", "title": "Similar clinical improvement and maintenance after rTMS at 5 Hz using a simple vs. complex protocol in Alzheimer's disease.", "journal": ["Brain stimulation", "Brain Stimul"]}
