It is often underdiagnosed because of the overlapping with Alzheimer disease symptoms. We report the F-FDG and F-florbetapir dynamic PET images (early and delay phases) of an 83-year-old woman with cognitive impairment associated with visual hallucinations and parkinsonism due to probable DLB. This image highlights that the early phases of F-florbetapir may reflect regional cerebral perfusion with a pattern very similar to that of regional glucose metabolism in DLB.", "doi": "10.1097/RLU.0000000000001952", "title": "The Added Value of Dynamic 18F-Florbetapir PET in the Assessment of Dementia With Lewy Bodies.", "journal": ["Clinical nuclear medicine", "Clin Nucl Med"]}
