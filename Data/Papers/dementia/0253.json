Accumulation of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) in the brain is considered central in AD pathogenesis and its understanding crucial for developing new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Recent literature suggests that ageing may induce post translational modifications in A\u03b2, in the form of spontaneous amino acid modifications, which enhance its pathogenic properties, contributing to its aggregation.In this study, we have investigated whether the isoaspartate (IsoD-A\u03b2) and pyroglutamate (pE3-A\u03b2) modified forms of A\u03b2 are significantly associated with AD pathology or represent markers of ageing. Cerebral neocortex of 27\u00a0AD cases, 32 old controls (OC) and 11 young controls (YC) was immunostained for pE3-A\u03b2 and IsoD-A\u03b2, quantified as protein load and correlated with other A\u03b2 forms and p-TAU.
