A\u03b2 oligomers are believed to cause synapse damage resulting in the memory deficits that are characteristic of this disease. Since the loss of synaptic proteins in the brain correlates closely with the degree of dementia in Alzheimer's disease, the process of A\u03b2-induced synapse damage was investigated in cultured neurons by measuring the loss of synaptic proteins. Soluble A\u03b2 oligomers, derived from Alzheimer's-affected brains, caused the loss of cysteine string protein and synaptophysin from neurons. When applied to synaptosomes A\u03b2 oligomers increased cholesterol concentrations and caused aberrant activation of cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2). In contrast, A\u03b2 monomer preparations did not affect cholesterol concentrations or activate synaptic cPLA2, nor did they damage synapses. The A\u03b2 oligomer-induced aggregation of cellular prion proteins (PrPC) at synapses triggered the activation of cPLA2 that leads to synapse degeneration. Critically, A\u03b2 monomer preparations did not cause the aggregation of PrPC; rather they reduced the A\u03b2 oligomer-induced aggregation of PrPC. The presence of A\u03b2 monomer preparations also inhibited the A\u03b2 oligomer-induced increase in cholesterol concentrations and activation of cPLA2 in synaptosomes and protected neurons against the A\u03b2 oligomer-induced synapse damage. These results support the hypothesis that A\u03b2 monomers are neuroprotective. We hypothesise that synapse damage may result from a pathological A\u03b2 monomer:oligomer ratio rather than the total concentrations of A\u03b2 within the brain.", "doi": "10.1016/j.nbd.2017.12.007", "title": "Monomeric amyloid-\u03b2 reduced amyloid-\u03b2 oligomer-induced synapse damage in neuronal cultures.", "journal": ["Neurobiology of disease", "Neurobiol.
