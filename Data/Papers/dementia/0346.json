Increasing concentrations of A\u03b2 within the brain cause synapse degeneration and the dementia that is characteristic of AD. Here the factors that affect the release of disease-relevant forms A\u03b2 were studied in a cell model. 7PA2 cells expressing the human amyloid precursor protein released soluble A\u03b2 oligomers that caused synapse damage in cultured neurons. Supernatants from 7PA2 cells treated with the cholesterol synthesis inhibitor squalestatin contained similar concentrations of A\u03b242 to control cells but did not cause synapse damage in neuronal cultures. These supernatants contained reduced concentrations of A\u03b242 oligomers and increased concentrations of A\u03b242 monomers. Treatment of 7PA2 cells with platelet-activating factor (PAF) antagonists had similar effects; it reduced concentrations of A\u03b242 oligomers and increased concentrations of A\u03b242 monomers in cell supernatants. PAF activated cholesterol ester hydrolases (CEH), enzymes that released cholesterol from stores of cholesterol esters. Inhibition of CEH also reduced concentrations of A\u03b242 oligomers and increased concentrations of A\u03b242 monomers in cell supernatants. The A\u03b2 monomers produced by treated cells protected neurons against A\u03b2 oligomer-induced synapse damage. These studies indicate that pharmacological manipulation of cells can alter the ratio of A\u03b2 monomer:oligomer released and consequently their effects on synapses.", "doi": "10.1016/j.bbadis.2017.12.017", "title": "Cholesterol ester hydrolase inhibitors reduce the production of synaptotoxic amyloid-\u03b2 oligomers.", "journal": ["Biochimica et biophysica acta", "Biochim.
