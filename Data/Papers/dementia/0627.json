Less is known about MCI in the south of China. The study is to estimate the prevalence of MCI and its subtypes in residents aged 65year or older in community-dwelling residents of Guangzhou, China.The study was a community-based, cross-sectional study conducted in rural and urban areas of Guangzhou between April and October 2009. Eight communities were randomly selected using a cluster sampling method. Each elderly was interviewed with Montreal Cognitive Assessment, the Mini-Mental state examination, Auditory Verbal Learning Test, the Clinical Dementia Rating scale et al. MCI was classified as amnestic MCI (a-MCI) or nonamnestic MCI (na-MCI).2427 individuals were contacted, but in-person interviews were conducted with 2111 participants. 299 participants with MCI were identified. The prevalence of MCI, a-MCI and na-MCI was 14.2%, 12.2%, 2.0% respectively. The prevalence of MCI and a-MCI increased with age, decreased with education level, and was higher in rural areas than in urban areas. The difference of prevalence of MCI and a-MCI between women with men wasn't statistically significant(MCI\u03c72=1.0, OR 0.9, 95%CI=0.6-1.2; a-MCI\u03c72=1.0, OR 0.9, 95%CI=0.6-1.2), when controlling for education by logistic regression analysis.The results suggest that 14.2% of elderly individuals are affected by MCI in Guangzhou, China. And MCI was dominated by a-MCI. The prevalence of MCI and a-MCI increased with age, decreased with education level, and was higher in the rural population compared to the urban population.", "doi": "10.1016/j.archger.2017.11.003", "title": "Prevalence of mild cognitive impairment and its subtypes in community-dwelling residents aged 65 years or older in Guangzhou, China.", "journal": ["Archives of gerontology and geriatrics", "Arch Gerontol Geriatr"]}
