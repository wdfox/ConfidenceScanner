We also assessed whether relationship type (parent, other family, friend) and dementia care status (yes or no) were moderators of any racial differences.We examined 887 informal caregivers via covariate-adjusted 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 factorial ANOVAs.After covariate adjustment, there were few significant racial differences in caregiving strain, health, and service use. Dementia caregivers reported greater strain, and there were three-way interactions among relationship type, dementia care status, and race for physical strain and emotional stress.Previous findings suggesting substantial racial differences in caregiver strain, which have primarily come from convenience samples that combined care relationship types, were not replicated. Racial and ethnic differences in caregiving may be context-specific. Historical changes in caregiving should be examined in future research.", "doi": "10.1177/0898264317743611", "title": "Racial Differences in Caregiving: Variation by Relationship Type and Dementia Care Status.", "journal": ["Journal of aging and health", "J Aging Health"]}
