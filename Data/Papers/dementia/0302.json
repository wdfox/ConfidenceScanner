In this study, we investigated whether safflower yellow (SY) can improve cognitive function, decrease Amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) accumulation and overactivation of astrocytes in AD mouse model. We found that SY treatment significantly ameliorated the learning and memory deficits of APP/PS1 mice. By hematoxylin-eosin staining, we found that the neuronal loss and death in APP/PS1 mice was decreased by SY treatment. Immunohistochemical staining showed that SY treatment dramatically down-regulated A\u03b21-42 deposition and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) level in APP/PS1 mice. Biochemical analysis also showed that SY treatment reduced soluble and insoluble A\u03b21-42 level in the cortex and soluble A\u03b21-42 level in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. Moreover, we found that SY treatment decreased the expression of proteins related to generation of A\u03b2, and markedly increased expression of enzymes associated with clearance of A\u03b2 in the brain of APP/PS1 mice. These results indicate that the SY can serve as a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of AD.", "doi": "10.1016/j.biopha.2017.12.099", "journal": ["Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie", "Biomed.
