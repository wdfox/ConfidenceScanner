We conduct a process analysis to determine the status quo of such healthcare processes in the region of Darmstadt, Germany and elicit existing gaps in the information and communication exchange. We identify key processes by performing a document analysis and conducting interviews with seven different healthcare professionals. The results of a weak point analysis based on advanced event driven process chains (EPC) point out 32 information and communication gaps summarized in four categories: \"information exchange\", \"information transfer\" \"information provision\" and \"activity impulse\". Our results show further opportunities regarding the support of caring relatives and primary care physicians.", "doi": null, "title": "Information and Communication Gaps in Intersectoral Healthcare Processes for Dementia Patients.", "journal": ["Studies in health technology and informatics", "Stud Health Technol Inform"]}
