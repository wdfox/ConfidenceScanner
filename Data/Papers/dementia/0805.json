Dementia Care Mapping (DCM) is perceived to be valuable in dementia care and promising in ID-care. The aim of this study was to evaluate the process of the first use of DCM in ID-care.DCM was used among older people with ID and care-staff in 12 group homes of six organisations. We obtained data on the first use of DCM in ID-care via focus-group discussions and face-to-face interviews with: care-staff (N = 24), managers (N = 10), behavioural specialists (N = 7), DCM-ID mappers (N = 12), and DCM-trainers (N = 2). We used the RE-AIM framework for a thematic process-analysis.All available staff (94%) participated in DCM (reach). Regarding its efficacy, staff considered DCM valuable; it provided them new knowledge and skills. Participants intended to adopt DCM, by continuing and expanding its use in their organisations. DCM was implemented as intended, and strictly monitored and supported by DCM-trainers. As for maintenance, DCM was further tailored to ID-care and a version for individual ID-care settings was developed, both as standards for international use. To sustain the use of DCM in ID-care, a multidisciplinary, interorganisational learning network was established.DCM tailored to ID-care proved to be an appropriate and valuable method to support staff in their work with aging clients, and it allows for further implementation. This is a first step to obtain an evidence-based method in ID-care for older clients.", "doi": "10.1080/13607863.2017.1401582", "title": "The first use of dementia care mapping in the care for older people with intellectual disability: a process analysis according to the RE-AIM framework.", "journal": ["Aging & mental health", "Aging Ment Health"]}
