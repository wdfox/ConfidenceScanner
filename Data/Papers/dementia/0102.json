All patients carried the m.3243A>G mutation.The detailed neuropsychological assessment revealed cognitive deficits in attention, executive function, visuoperception, and -construction. There were significant correlations between these cognitive changes, lesion load in MRI, disturbances in everyday life (clinical scale), and high scores in NMDAS.Patients with MELAS syndrome showed no global neuropsychological deficit, but rather distinct cognitive deficits.", "doi": "10.1016/j.mito.2017.12.012", "title": "Cognitive impairment, clinical severity and MRI changes in MELAS syndrome.", "journal": ["Mitochondrion", "Mitochondrion"]}
