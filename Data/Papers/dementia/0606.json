[Subjects and Methods] A total of 53 patients with dementia were tested on TUG, BBS, 4MWT and GMWT with a prospective cohort methodological design. Intra-class Correlation Coefficients (ICCs) to assess relative reliability and the standard error of measurement (SEM), minimal detectable change (MDC95) and its percentage (MDC%) to analyze the absolute reliability were calculated. [Results] Inter-rater reliability (ICC(2,3)) of TUG, BBS and GMWT was 0.99 and that of 4MWT was 0.82. Inter-rater reliability was high for TUG, BBS and GMWT, with low SEM, MDC95, and MDC%. Inter-rater reliability was low for 4MWT, with high SEM, MDC95, and MDC%. Test-retest (ICC(2,3)) of TUG, BBS and GMWT was 0.96-0.99 and Test-retest (ICC(2,3)) of 4MWT was 0.85. The test-retest was high for TUG, BBS and GMWT, with low SEM, MDC95, and MDC%, but it was low for 4MWT, with high SEM, MDC95, and MDC%. [Conclusion] The relative reliability was high for all the assessment tools. The absolute reliability has a reasonable level of stability except the 4MWT.", "doi": "10.1589/jpts.29.1934", "title": "The Korean version of relative and absolute reliability of gait and balance assessment tools for patients with dementia in day care center and nursing home.", "journal": ["Journal of physical therapy science", "J Phys Ther Sci"]}
