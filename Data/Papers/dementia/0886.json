Determinants and course of cognitive function afterward are, however, unclear. We prospectively determined cognitive performance after TIA and TNA in relation to clinical diagnosis and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) results.TIA and TNA patients aged \u226545 years without prior stroke or dementia underwent comprehensive cognitive assessment and magnetic resonance imaging within 7 days after the qualifying event. Cognitive tests were repeated after 6 months. Domain-specific compound z scores based on the baseline mean and SD were calculated. Repeated-measures analysis was used to test for differences in domain-specific cognitive performance over time between DWI-positive and DWI-negative patients, as well as between TIA and TNA patients.One hundred twenty-one patients were included (mean age (SD), 64.6 years (9.2 years), 60% TIA and 40% TNA) of whom 32 (26%) had a DWI lesion. Executive function performance decreased over time (mean change in compound score -0.23; P=0.01 adjusted for age, sex, education), whereas attention improved (0.11; P=0.02), and information processing speed and episodic memory remained unchanged. Patients with a DWI lesion had worse executive function at baseline than those without a DWI lesion (compound scores -0.26 versus 0.08; P=0.048), which persisted throughout the study period (P=0.04). Clinical diagnosis (TIA or TNA) was not related to cognitive function over time.Executive function declines during the first 6 months after TIA or TNA. Patients with an initial DWI lesion have persisting worse executive function than those without.", "doi": "10.1161/STROKEAHA.117.018298", "title": "Executive Function Declines in the First 6 Months After a Transient Ischemic Attack or Transient Neurological Attack.", "journal": ["Stroke", "Stroke"]}
