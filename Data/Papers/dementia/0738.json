This provides an opportunity for interventional clinical trials to potentially delay or prevent the onset of cognitive impairment or dementia. CNP520 (a beta-site-amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme inhibitor) is in clinical development for the treatment of preclinical Alzheimer's disease under the Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative Generation Program. The Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative is a public-private partnership intended to accelerate the evaluation of Alzheimer's disease prevention therapies. The Generation Program comprises two pivotal phase II/III studies with similar designs to assess the efficacy and safety of investigational treatments in a cognitively unimpaired population at increased risk for developing Alzheimer's disease based on age and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype (i.e., presence of the APOE \u03b54 allele). The program has been designed to maximize benefit to Alzheimer's disease research. Generation Study 1 (NCT02565511) and Generation Study 2 (NCT03131453) are currently enrolling; their key features are presented here.", "doi": "10.14283/jpad.2017.37", "title": "The Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative Generation Program: Evaluating CNP520 Efficacy in the Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease.", "journal": ["The journal of prevention of Alzheimer's disease", "J Prev Alzheimers Dis"]}
