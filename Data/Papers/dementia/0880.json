Here, we assessed understanding of sinewave speech (a paradigm of degraded speech perception) and general cognitive abilities in 17 AD patients, before and following a 10 mg dose of donepezil. Relative to healthy older individuals, patients had impaired sinewave speech comprehension that was selectively ameliorated by donepezil. Our findings demonstrate impaired perception of degraded speech in AD but retained perceptual learning capacity that can be harnessed by acetylcholinesterase inhibition, with implications for designing communication interventions and acoustic environments in dementia.", "doi": "10.1002/acn3.471", "title": "Donepezil enhances understanding of degraded speech in Alzheimer's disease.", "journal": ["Annals of clinical and translational neurology", "Ann Clin Transl Neurol"]}
