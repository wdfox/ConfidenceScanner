This paper explores pharmacists' perceptions of the nature and effectiveness of pharmacy services provided, and their experiences when providing these services. Community pharmacists delivering services to care homes with dementia in Thurrock, Essex and in Medway, Kent, England were invited to participate in the study involving face-to-face interviews. Analysis of semi-structured interviews with 15 community pharmacists revealed that the main pharmaceutical service provided by the pharmacists was prescription processing, normally involving the clinical review and supply of medication into monitored dosage systems (dosette boxes) and delivery to the homes. This was coupled with advice to care homes on the appropriate storage and administration of drugs and appliances supplied, which was in line with the NHS Community Pharmacy Contractual Framework Enhanced Service for care homes. A majority of the community pharmacists interviewed acknowledged that the services they were currently commissioned to provide did not meet the pharmaceutical care needs of dementia patients in care homes, including the monitoring of the appropriateness, safety and effectiveness of drug therapy.", "doi": "10.1177/1471301217743305", "title": "Pharmaceutical care services to people living with dementia in care homes: A qualitative study of community pharmacists' perceptions.", "journal": ["Dementia (London, England)", "Dementia (London)"]}
