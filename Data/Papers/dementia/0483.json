Meta-analytic and systematic review methods sought to determine the prevalence rate of mental health disorders in older military veterans (\u226565 years).Eleven studies were eligible, and meta-analyses of veteran depression, substance abuse, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, dementia, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia were conducted.Although conducted exclusively with U.S. veterans, high prevalence rates of substance (5.7%) and alcohol use disorders (5.4%) in older veterans were found. However, the prevalence of other mental health disorders, including PTSD and depression, in older veterans was not markedly high.The rates of disorder prevalence observed indicates a need for continued awareness of mental health difficulties, particularly substance and alcohol use disorders, in older veterans. In the future studies with non-U.S. military samples using a longitudinal design are required to further understand the prevalence of mental health disorders in geriatric veterans.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jagp.2017.11.001", "title": "Prevalence of Mental Health Disorders in Elderly U.S. Military Veterans: A Meta-Analysis and Systematic Review.", "journal": ["The American journal of geriatric psychiatry : official journal of the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry", "Am J Geriatr Psychiatry"]}
