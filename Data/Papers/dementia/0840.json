Here, we applied the advantage of human iPSC-derived neurons, which offer human-specific drug responsiveness, to screen and evaluate therapeutic candidates for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using AD patient neurons with nearly 100% purity from iPSCs, we established a robust and reproducible assay for amyloid \u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2), a pathogenic molecule in AD, and screened a pharmaceutical compound library. We\u00a0acquired 27 A\u03b2-lowering screen hits, prioritized hits\u00a0by chemical structure-based clustering, and selected 6 leading compounds. Next, to maximize the anti-A\u03b2 effect, we selected a synergistic combination of bromocriptine, cromolyn, and topiramate as an anti-A\u03b2 cocktail. Finally, using neurons from familial and sporadic AD patients, we found that the cocktail showed a significant and potent anti-A\u03b2 effect on patient cells. This human iPSC-based platform promises to be useful for AD drug development.", "doi": "10.1016/j.celrep.2017.10.109", "title": "iPSC-Based Compound Screening and In\u00a0Vitro Trials Identify a Synergistic Anti-amyloid \u03b2 Combination for Alzheimer's Disease.", "journal": ["Cell reports", "Cell Rep"]}
