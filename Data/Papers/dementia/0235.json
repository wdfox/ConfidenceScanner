Here we demonstrate that the repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation of (GGGGCC) n -containing RNAs into poly-dipeptides can initiate in vivo without a 5'-cap. The primary RNA substrate for RAN translation of C9ORF72 sense repeats is shown to be the spliced first intron, following its excision from the initial pre-mRNA and transport to the cytoplasm. Cap-independent RAN translation is shown to be upregulated by various stress stimuli through phosphorylation of the \u03b1 subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF2\u03b1), the core event of an integrated stress response (ISR). Compounds inhibiting phospho-eIF2\u03b1-signaling pathways are shown to suppress RAN translation. Since the poly-dipeptides can themselves induce stress, these findings support a feedforward loop with initial repeat-mediated toxicity enhancing RAN translation and subsequent production of additional poly-dipeptides through ISR, thereby promoting progressive disease.", "doi": "10.1038/s41467-017-02495-z", "journal": ["Nature communications", "Nat Commun"], "date": "2018-01-18_23:41:30"}
