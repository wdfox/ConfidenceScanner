Ultrasound-sensitive coated microbubbles (in a targeted lipid nanoemulsion) are available. Versatile small molecule drug(s) targeting multiple pathways of Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis are known. By incorporating such drug(s) into the targeted \"lipid-coated microbubble\" [LCM]/\"nanoparticle-derived\" [ND] (or LCM/ND) nanoemulsion type, one obtains a multitasking combination therapeutic for translational medicine. This multitasking therapeutic targets cell-surface scavenger receptors (mainly class B type I), or SR-BI, making possible for various Alzheimer's-related cell types to be simultaneously searched out for localized drug treatment in vivo. Besides targeting cell-surface SR-BI, the proposed LCM/ND-nanoemulsion combination therapeutic(s) include a characteristic lipid-coated microbubble [LCM] subpopulation (i.e., a stable LCM suspension); such film-stabilized microbubbles are well known to substantially reduce the acoustic power levels needed for accomplishing temporary noninvasive (transcranial) ultrasound treatment, or sonoporation, if additionally desired for the Alzheimer's patient.", "doi": "10.1016/j.cis.2017.12.002", "title": "Nanotherapy for Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia: Targeting senile endothelium.", "journal": ["Advances in colloid and interface science", "Adv Colloid Interface Sci"]}
