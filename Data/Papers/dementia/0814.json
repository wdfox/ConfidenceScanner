In this study, 94 subjects underwent extensive dementia screening. Let-7b miRNA was found to increase in association with the progression of AD, and the increase in let-7b miRNA was mainly due to CD4+ T cells in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Additionally, let-7b was positively correlated with the expression of t-Tau and p-Tau. The inclusion of let-7b in A\u03b240-A\u03b242 or t-tau-p-tau logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic predictive models can significantly improve the diagnostic performance. Overall, let-7b has an important association with the pathology of AD and can be used as an adjunct to improve the diagnostic performance of traditional AD biomarkers.", "doi": "10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.11.122", "title": "Cerebrospinal fluid CD4+ T lymphocyte-derived miRNA-let-7b can enhances the diagnostic performance of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers.", "journal": ["Biochemical and biophysical research communications", "Biochem.
