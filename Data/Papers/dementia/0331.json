Prevalence of dementia and AD is higher in women for nearly every age group. AD is the most common cause of dementia (50%-70% of all cases). Dementia is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, disability, and dependence, and results in a considerable decrease in quality of life and survival. Around 80% of all patients with dementia are cared for by their families, which cover a mean of 87% of the total economic cost, resulting in considerable economic and health burden on caregivers and loss of quality of life. The economic impact of dementia is huge and difficult to evaluate due to the combination of direct and indirect costs. More comprehensive programmes should be developed and resources dedicated to research, prevention, early diagnosis, multidimensional treatment, and multidisciplinary management of these patients in order to reduce the health, social, and economic burden of dementia.", "doi": "10.1016/j.nrl.2017.10.005", "title": "Report by the Spanish Foundation of the Brain on the social impact of Alzheimer disease and other types of dementia.", "journal": ["Neurologia (Barcelona, Spain)", "Neurologia"]}
