However, human body can adapt relatively well to heat and cold environments and recent studies have also elucidated that particularly heat stress might be even highly beneficial for human health. Consequently, the aim of the present brief review is first to discuss general cardiovascular and other responses to acute heat stress, followed by a review of beneficial effects of Finnish sauna bathing on general and cardiovascular health and mortality as well as dementia and Alzheimer's disease risk. Plausible mechanisms that are included are improved endothelial and microvascular function, reduced blood pressure and arterial stiffness and possibly increased angiogenesis in humans, which are likely to mediate health benefits of sauna bathing. In addition to heat exposure with physiological adaptations, cold stress induced physiological responses and brown fat activation on health will also be discussed. This is important to take into consideration as sauna bathing is frequently associated with cooling periods in cold(er) environments, but their combination, however, remains poorly investigated. We finally therefore propose that possible additive effects of heat and cold stress-induced adaptations and effects on health would be worth of further investigation.", "doi": "10.1152/ajpregu.00115.2017", "title": "The effects of heat and cold on health - with special reference to Finnish Sauna bathing.", "journal": ["American journal of physiology.
