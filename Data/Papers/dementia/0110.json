The blocking activities of forty one small molecules against A\u03b2-induced mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening were evaluated by JC-1 assay which measures the change of mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m). The inhibitory activity of twenty five compounds against A\u03b2-induced mPTP opening was superior to that of the standard cyclosporin A (CsA). Six hit compounds have been identified as likely safe in regards to mitochondrial and cellular safety and subjected to assessment for their protective effect against A\u03b2-induced deterioration of ATP production and cytotoxicity. Among them, compound 7fb has been identified as a lead compound protecting neuronal cells against 67% of neurocytotoxicity and 43% of suppression of mitochondrial ATP production induced by 5\u202f\u03bcM concentrations of A\u03b2. Using CDocker algorithm, a molecular docking model presented a plausible binding mode for these compounds with cyclophilin D (CypD) receptor as a major component of mPTP. Hence, this report presents compound 7fb as a new nonpeptidyl mPTP blocker which would be promising for further development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapeutics.", "doi": "10.1016/j.ejmech.2017.12.045", "title": "Synthesis and evaluation of 2-(3-arylureido)pyridines and 2-(3-arylureido)pyrazines as potential modulators of A\u03b2-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease.", "journal": ["European journal of medicinal chemistry", "Eur J Med Chem"]}
