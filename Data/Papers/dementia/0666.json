Mitochondrion is a dynamic organelle for producing cellular energy and determining cell fates. Stress-induced translocated GSK-3\u03b2 may interact with mitochondrial proteins, including PI3K-Akt, PGC-1\u03b1, HK II, PKC\u03b5, components of respiratory chain, and subunits of mPTP. Mitochondrial pool of GSK-3\u03b2 has been implicated in mediation of mitochondrial functions. GSK-3\u03b2 exhibits the regulatory effects on mitochondrial biogenesis, mitochondrial bioenergetics, mitochondrial permeability, mitochondrial motility, and mitochondrial apoptosis. The versatile functions of GSK-3\u03b2 might be associated with its wide range of substrates. Accumulative evidence demonstrates that GSK-3\u03b2 inactivation may be potentially developed as the promising strategy in management of many diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Intensive efforts have been made for exploring GSK-3\u03b2 inhibitors. Natural products provide us a great source for screening new lead compounds in inactivation of GSK-3\u03b2. The key roles of GSK-3\u03b2 in mediation of mitochondrial functions are discussed in this review.", "doi": "10.1159/000485580", "title": "The Key Roles of GSK-3\u03b2 in Regulating Mitochondrial Activity.", "journal": ["Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology", "Cell.
