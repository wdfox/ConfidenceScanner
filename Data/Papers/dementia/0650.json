This study is based on qualitative research using 29 semi-structured interviews with family members who had previously been informal caregivers, as well as using fieldwork, all in the same nursing home. The interviews were analysed by the three steps of content analysis. The results show the identification of three main categories with nine main subcategories. The categories and subcategories in the table clarify and explain how the interviewees tended to compare the situation in Iran with that in Sweden, how they perceived the situation in Sweden and finally how they also saw the culturally profiled nursing home.", "doi": "10.1177/1471301217743835", "title": "Iranian relatives' attitudes towards culturally profiled nursing homes for individuals living with dementia.", "journal": ["Dementia (London, England)", "Dementia (London)"]}
