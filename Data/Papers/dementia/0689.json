The patients were followed yearly by mailed questionnaires, including a self-assessed modified Rankin Scale (smRS) and a subjective comparison between their present and their preoperative health condition. The replies were grouped according to the length of follow-up after surgery. Data on clinical evaluations, vascular comorbidity, and reoperations were extracted from the SHQR.On the smRS, 40% (38-41) of the patients were improved 2-6\u00a0years after surgery and around 60% reported their general health condition to be better than preoperatively. Reoperation did not influence the outcome after 2-6\u00a0years. The presence of vascular comorbidity had no negative impact on the outcome after 2-6\u00a0years, assessed as improvement on the smRS or subjective improvement of the health condition, except after 6\u00a0years when patients with hypertension and a history of stroke showed a less favorable development on the smRS.This registry-based study shows no negative impact of complications and only minor effects of vascular comorbidity on the long-term outcome in iNPH.", "doi": "10.1007/s00415-017-8680-z", "title": "Long-term effects of complications and vascular comorbidity in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: a quality registry study.", "journal": ["Journal of neurology", "J.
