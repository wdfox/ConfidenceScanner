Case 2 showed slow reaction and dementia behaviors including worse memory and the decrease of calculation and orientation ability in this patient. Case 3 is a peripheral incomplete left oculomotor nerve palsy patient. Magnetic resonance imaging findings of three patients are different. And single photon emission computed tomography showed the regional cerebral blood flow was all hypoperfused. There were some difficulties in diagnosing and treating the patients in these three cases.The clinical manifestations and imaging findings of neurosyphilis are diverse. Clinicians should pay attention to neurosyphilis. After clear diagnosis, patients would receive norm treatment in time.", "doi": "10.1080/00207454.2017.1412963", "title": "Diversity in clinical manifestations and imaging features of neurosyphilis: obstacles to the diagnosis and treatment (report of three cases).", "journal": ["The International journal of neuroscience", "Int.
