Some PLOSL-causing variants in TREM2 have also been associated with Alzheimer's disease when heterozygous. Here, we studied the PLOSLFINTYROBP deletion that covers 4 of the gene's 5 exons. We genotyped 3220 older Finns (mean age 79, range 58-104) and found 11 deletion carriers (mean age 78, range 60-94). The carrier prevalence was 0.0034 (1 in 293) that matches previous findings in younger cohorts suggesting no significant early mortality. By comparing Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores and diagnoses of dementia, we did not find any significant differences between TYROBP deletion carriers and noncarriers (all p-values >0.5). Neuropathological analysis of 2 deletion carriers (aged 89 and 94 years) demonstrated only minimal beta amyloid pathology (Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) score 0). Collectively these results suggest that heterozygous carriership of the TYROBP deletion is not a major risk factor of cognitive impairment.", "doi": "10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2017.12.008", "title": "Heterozygous TYROBP deletion (PLOSLFIN) is not a strong risk factor for cognitive impairment.", "journal": ["Neurobiology of aging", "Neurobiol.
