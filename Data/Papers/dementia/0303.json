The data account for the number of hospital admissions for one year before the data collection. Clock Drawing Test and delayed word recall were employed to measure CI.The severity of CI is one of the factors significantly associated with HA. Controlling for the level of function, the likelihood of HA increased among respondents with moderate, mild-to-moderate, and mild CI. Counterintuitively, HA was reduced when CI is severe.People with CI are at more risk of frequent HA and the severity of impairment can increase this risk subsequently. Screening for CI at admission can open up the possibility of interventions, hence reducing complications during and after hospitalization.", "doi": "10.1177/0898264317747078", "title": "The Level of Cognitive Impairment and Likelihood of Frequent Hospital Admissions.", "journal": ["Journal of aging and health", "J Aging Health"]}
