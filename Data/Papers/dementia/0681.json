Fatty acids were measured in erythrocyte cell membranes using gas chromatography. Associations between erythrocyte membrane MUFAs and SFAs and cortical A\u03b2 load were explored using adjusted multiple linear regression models and were considered significant at p \u2264 0.005 (10 comparisons) after correction for multiple testing.We found no significant associations between fatty acids and cortical A\u03b2 load using multiple linear regression adjusted for age, sex, education, cognition, PET-scan to clinical assessment interval, PET-scan to blood collection interval and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) status. The association closest to significance was that between erythrocyte membrane stearic acid and A\u03b2 (B-coefficient 0.03, 95 % CI: 0.00,0.05, p = 0.05). This association, although statistically non-significant, appeared to be stronger amongst ApoE \u03b54 carriers (B-coefficient 0.04, 95 % CI: -0.01,0.09, p = 0.08) compared to ApoE \u03b54 non-carriers (B-coefficient 0.02, 95 % CI: -0.01,0.05, p = 0.18) in age and sex stratified analysis.Future research in the form of large longitudinal observational study is needed to validate our findings, particularly regarding the potential association of stearic acid with cortical A\u03b2.", "doi": "10.1007/s12603-017-0975-3", "title": "Association of Cortical \u03b2-Amyloid with Erythrocyte Membrane Monounsaturated and Saturated Fatty Acids in Older Adults at Risk of Dementia.", "journal": ["The journal of nutrition, health & aging", "J Nutr Health Aging"]}
