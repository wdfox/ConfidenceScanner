We explored the association between tamsulosin use and dementia risk.We used Medicare data (2006-2012) to conduct a cohort study among patients aged \u226565\u00a0years and diagnosed with BPH. Men taking tamsulosin (n\u00a0=\u00a0253\u00a0136) were matched at a 1:1 ratio using propensity-scores to each of 6 comparison cohorts: patients who used no BPH-medication (n\u00a0=\u00a0180\u00a0926), and patients who used the following alternative-BPH-medications: doxazosin (n\u00a0=\u00a028\u00a0581), terazosin (n\u00a0=\u00a023\u00a0858), alfuzosin (n\u00a0=\u00a017\u00a0934), dutasteride (n\u00a0=\u00a034\u00a0027), and finasteride (n\u00a0=\u00a038\u00a0767). Assessment began following the first fill of BPH-medication to identify incident dementia by ICD-9 diagnosis codes. We estimated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dementia using Cox proportional hazard regression for each of the 6 propensity-score-matched cohort-pairs.The median follow-up period for all cohorts was 19.8\u00a0months. After propensity-score matching, the tamsulosin cohort had an incidence of dementia of 31.3/1000 person-years compared with only 25.9/1000 person-years in the no-BPH-medication cohort. The risk of dementia was significantly higher in the tamsulosin cohort, when compared with the no-BPH-medication cohort (HR [95% CI]: 1.17 [1.14, 1.21]) and each of the alternative-BPH-medication cohorts: doxazosin (1.20 [1.12, 1.28]), terazosin (1.11 [1.04, 1.19]), alfuzosin (1.12 [1.03, 1.22]), dutasteride (1.26 [1.19, 1.34]), and finasteride (1.13 [1.07, 1.19]).
