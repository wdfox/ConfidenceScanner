This led to the development and evaluation of a moderate-intensity home-based functional exercise program guided by theories from exercise science and the Strength-Based Approach. Data indicated excellent treatment adherence (99.04%) along with high levels of acceptability and feasibility in this sample (age 76.63 years (9.84); Mini Mental State Exam 18.87 (6.40)). This article informs future practice by highlighting the merits of a Strength-Based Approach in research examining exercise and physical rehabilitation to improve adherence and compliance with individuals with dementia.", "doi": "10.1177/1471301217730951", "title": "Findings from a strength-based moderate-intensity exercise interventions for individuals with dementia (innovative practice).", "journal": ["Dementia (London, England)", "Dementia (London)"]}
