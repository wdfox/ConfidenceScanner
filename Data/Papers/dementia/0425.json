Although several studies have established a role of GSK3 signaling in the nervous system, much less is known about isoform-specific functions. Here, we have examined the role of GSK3\u03b1 and GSK3\u03b2 in the developing neocortex by performing in utero electroporation with specific small interfering RNAs targeting each isoform. We found that depletion of either GSK3\u03b1 or GSK3\u03b2 commonly promoted the proliferation of neural progenitor cells in the ventricular zone, but at later stages, knocking down of each isoform resulted in distinct outcomes. In particular, the transformation of radial progenitors to intermediate progenitor cells was promoted in GSK3\u03b1-depleted cells, but markedly prevented in GSK3\u03b2-depleted cells. Moreover, knocking down of GSK3\u03b2 but not GSK3\u03b1 prevented the generation of upper-layer Cux1+ neurons. Consistent with the distinct outcomes, protein levels of c-Myc and \u03b2-catenin, well-known substrates of GSK3, were differentially affected by depletion of GSK3\u03b1 and GSK3\u03b2. Together, these results suggest that GSK3\u03b1 and GSK3\u03b2 might play distinct roles in the genesis and differentiation of neuronal lineage cells during neocortex development by differential regulation of downstream signaling pathways.", "doi": "10.3389/fnmol.2017.00391", "title": "Differential Roles of Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 Subtypes Alpha and Beta in Cortical Development.", "journal": ["Frontiers in molecular neuroscience", "Front Mol Neurosci"]}
