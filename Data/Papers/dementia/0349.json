Rats were subjected to bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) surgery and administered ligustrazine intragastrically for 6 weeks. At the end of the experiments, the hippocampal biomarkers brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1), and homocysteine (Hcy) were examined. In experiments in vitro, OGD PC12 cells were treated with ligustrazine for 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12, or 24 h. The cell-released biomarkers BDNF, MCP-1, and Hcy were examined. Microscopy, acridine orange-ethidium bromide (AO/EB) staining, and flow cytometry assays were performed to investigate apoptosis. Cleaved caspase-3, Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax), and B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) expression was examined using Western blot assays. The results showed that biomarkers, including MCP-1 and Hcy, were significantly increased in both the in vivo and in vitro models, while the BDNF level was significantly decreased compared with the sham or vehicle models. Microscopy, AO/EB staining, and flow cytometry analysis showed that severe cell damage occurred in OGD PC12 cells, and apoptosis played a major role in this environment. Further Western blot studies showed that the apoptosis-related Bax/Bcl-2 protein ratio and cleaved caspase-3 were significantly increased in the experiment. However, ligustrazine profoundly suppressed the imbalance of these biomarkers, reduced cell damage, decreased the Bax/Bcl-2, and downregulated cleaved caspase-3. Pro- and anti-apoptotic biomarkers of multiple pathways including BDNF, MCP-1, and Hcy played a joint role in triggering the activation of the mitochondria-related Bax/Bcl-2 and caspase-3 apoptosis pathway in VD. Ligustrazine attenuated VD by comprehensively regulating BDNF, MCP-1, and Hcy and inactivating the Bax/Bcl-2 and caspase-3 apoptosis pathway. Our data provide novel insight into ligustrazine, which is a promising neuroprotective agent for VD disease treatment strategies. \u00a9 IUBMB Life, 70(1):60-70, 2018.", "doi": "10.1002/iub.1704", "title": "Ligustrazine suppresses neuron apoptosis via the Bax/Bcl-2 and caspase-3 pathway in PC12 cells and in rats with vascular dementia.", "journal": ["IUBMB life", "IUBMB Life"]}
