Excessive extra cellular deposits of amyloid beta (A\u03b2) are a pathological feature of AD. A\u03b2 can cause cell death through oxidative damage; recent studies have implicated opening of mPTP as a detrimental event in AD-related mitochondrial dysfunctions. Over the past few years, natural compounds with antioxidant properties have shown promise for intervention in AD.", "doi": "10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.11.082", "title": "Perillyl alcohol alleviates amyloid-\u03b2 peptides-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and cytotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells.", "journal": ["International journal of biological macromolecules", "Int.
