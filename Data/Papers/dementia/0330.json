Oligoclonal IgG bands (OCBs) were discovered in the VE patients (Green et al., 2003). In this study we analysed the association of OCBs with clinical symptoms in 58 VE patients. Positive oligoclonal IgG are associated with a shorter duration of disease (p=0.002), older age of onset (p=0.023) and high frequency of main neurological VE symptoms such as dementia, frontal dysbasia, bulbar disorders, muscle atrophy and centrally caused pelvic disorders. Our results show that the OCBs in VE patients are associated with more severe central nervous system (CNS) damage and may cause secondary complications in the course of the disease.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jns.2017.11.030", "title": "Intrathecal synthesis of oligoclonal IgG in patients with Viliuisk encephalomyelitis: The relationship between oligoclonal bands and clinical features.", "journal": ["Journal of the neurological sciences", "J.
