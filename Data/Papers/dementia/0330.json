Alterations of some metabolic factors, such as deficiency of vitamin D, are a risk factor for cognitive deterioration.

In patients with low levels of vitamin D -11 MCI, 9 VEAD and 20 HC- lymphocyte H2O2-death, plasma A\u03b21-40 levels and cognitive status were evaluated pre- and post-vitamin D supplementation for 6 months.Lymphocytes from MCI and VEAD patients showed increased susceptibility to oxidative death at study entry. In MCI, but not VEAD patients, lymphocyte susceptibility to death and A\u03b21-40 levels plasma levels improved after 6 months of vitamin D supplementation. In addition, cognitive status on follow-up (18 months) improved in MCI patients after vitamin D supplementation.Vitamin D supplementation may be beneficial in MCI.
