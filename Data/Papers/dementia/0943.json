Cross-sectional survey interviews were conducted with 95 middle-aged and older Vietnamese Americans. Vietnamese Americans showed limited knowledge about Alzheimer's disease. Normalization of Alzheimer's disease in old age was prevalent. They lacked knowledge about treatment and cure of Alzheimer's disease. Those who reside longer in the U.S. and are more exposed to Alzheimer's disease are likely to have higher levels of Alzheimer's disease knowledge. Our study identified current Alzheimer's disease knowledge level and status, and areas of misconceptions and knowledge gaps among Vietnamese Americans, calling for urgent needs for educational outreach to improve knowledge about Alzheimer's disease among Vietnamese Americans. Information about who can be more or less knowledgeable about Alzheimer's disease can be used to strategize and tailor outreach efforts for different segments of the Vietnamese American population.", "doi": "10.1177/1471301217691616", "title": "Knowledge of Alzheimer's disease among Vietnamese Americans and correlates of their knowledge about Alzheimer's disease.", "journal": ["Dementia (London, England)", "Dementia (London)"]}
