Clinical diagnosis and prediction of neuropathological substrates are hampered by heterogeneous pictures. Diagnostic markers are key in clinical trials to differentiate FTD from other neurodegenerative dementias. In the same view, identifying the neuropathological hallmarks of the disease is key in light of future disease-modifying treatments. The aim of the present review is to unravel the progress in biomarker discovery, discussing the potential applications of available biological, imaging, and neurophysiological markers.", "doi": "10.3233/JAD-170584", "title": "Biological, Neuroimaging, and\u00a0Neurophysiological Markers in\u00a0Frontotemporal Dementia: Three\u00a0Faces\u00a0of\u00a0the Same Coin.", "journal": ["Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD", "J.
