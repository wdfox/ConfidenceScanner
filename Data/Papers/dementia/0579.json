Neurodegenerative conditions, including progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), are primarily characterized by accumulation of tau protein in the brain. Recent imaging developments for tau pathology may provide a promising tool for the assessment of diagnosis, prognosis, and progression of these neurodegenerative disorders. This review will survey PET studies to describe the recent advances in the imaging of tau pathology in PSP, CBD, and FTD.", "doi": "10.1080/09540261.2017.1396446", "title": "New advances in tau imaging in parkinsonism.", "journal": ["International review of psychiatry (Abingdon, England)", "Int Rev Psychiatry"]}
