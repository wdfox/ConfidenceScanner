In controls, quadratic and linear associations were found between cortisol and immediate recall scores (total and bias, respectively). Besides, quadratic and linear associations were observed between anxiety and delayed recognition scores (total and bias, respectively).The emotional memory of patients with Alzheimer\u00b4s disease is not related to stress markers as healthy older adults' is. Future studies that include moderating variables are needed to explain the lack of association.", "doi": "10.1017/S1041610217002642", "title": "Effects of stress on emotional memory in patients with Alzheimer's disease and in healthy elderly.", "journal": ["International psychogeriatrics", "Int Psychogeriatr"]}
