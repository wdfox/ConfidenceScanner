Deranged \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) trafficking across the blood-brain barrier is known to be a critical element in the pathogenesis of AD. In the vascular endothelial cells of hippocampus, A\u03b2 transport is mainly mediated by low-density lipoprotein-associated protein 1 (LRP1) and the receptor for advanced glycation end (RAGE) products; therefore, LRP1 and RAGE endothelial cells are potential therapeutic targets for AD. In this study, we explored the effects of Formononetin (FMN) on learning and memory improvement in APP/PS1 mice and the related mechanisms. We found that FMN significantly improved learning and memory ability by suppressing A\u03b2 production from APP processing, RAGE-dependent inflammatory signaling and promoted LRP1-dependent cerebral A\u03b2 clearance pathway. Moreover, FMN treatment alleviated ultrastructural changes in hippocampal vascular endothelial cells. In conclusion, we believe that FMN may be an efficacious and promising treatment for AD.", "doi": "10.1080/09168451.2017.1399788", "title": "Neuroprotective effect of formononetin in ameliorating learning and memory impairment in mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.", "journal": ["Bioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry", "Biosci.
