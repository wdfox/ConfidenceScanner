To examine the validity of the diagnosis, neuropsychiatrists carried out further diagnosis of dementia for all the participants. We regarded the dementia patients who received care for disability under the long-term care insurance program as having disabling dementia.Multivariable odds ratio (95% confidence interval) in single-grade increments of the activity was 2.1 (1.7-2.5) for dementia and 2.8 (2.2-3.4) for disabling dementia. The grades\u2009\u2265I and \u2265IIa were near the upper-left corner in the receiver operating characteristic curves. Setting the cut-off point at grades\u2009\u2265I or \u2265IIa yielded a higher integrated discrimination improvement, suggesting a major improvement in reducing misclassification by using these cut-off points. When we used grades\u2009\u2265I as the cut-off point, the sensitivity (95% confidence limits) was 65% (58-72%) and the specificity was 93% (91-96%) for dementia, and the corresponding values in grades\u2009\u2265IIa were 54% (47-62%) and 96% (94-97%). The corresponding values for disabling dementia were 83% (76-90%), 92% (90-95%), 73% (65-80%) and 96% (94-97%).Our findings suggest that selection of grades\u2009\u2265I or \u2265IIa as the cut-off point would reduce instances of misclassification in the identification of dementia and disabling dementia.
