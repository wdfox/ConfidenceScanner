and forecast value of stress hyperglycemia on the early vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) in stroke patients.Methods Totally 422 patients with acute non-diabetic stroke were divided into three groups according to the fasting plasma glucose level:the euglycemia group (<6.1 mmol/L),the mild stress hyperglycemia group (6.1-7.0 mmol/L),and the severe stress hyperglycemia group (\u22657.0 mmol/L).Mini-mental state examination,Alzheimer's disease rating scale cognitive subscale,and clinical dementia rating scale were used to evaluate early cognition in post-stroke patients,and patients were divided into three groups accordingly:normal cognitive function group,mild VCI group,and vascular dementia group.Correlation analysis was carried out on the level of stress hyperglycemia and the degree of VCI.Results Of these 422 patients,stress hyperglycemia was identified in 62 cases (14.7%).The risk of stress hyperglycemia was higher in patients with a high degree of education [(8.39\u00b13.85)years vs.(6.62\u00b14.39)years,P=0.037)] or a history of cardiovascular disease (45.2% vs.18.3%,P=0.001).VCI was detected in 270 patients (64.0%).Age,sex,smoking,National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score,Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score,stress hyperglycemia,and history of cardiovascular disease were related with early VCI after non-diabetic ischemic stroke (P<0.05).Multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that stress hyperglycemia was an independent risk factor for VCI in patients with non-diabetic ischemic stroke (OR=3.086,95% CI=1.065-8.929).The risks of cognitive impairment in the mild stress hyperglycemia group and the severe stress hyperglycemia group were higher than that of the euglycemia group,while it was also higher in the severe stress hyperglycemia group than in the mild stress hyperglycemia group (61.11% vs.75.00% vs.90.91%).Stress hyperglycemia was positively correlated with the high risk of early cognitive impairment in stroke patients (rs=0.185,P=0.007).Conclusion There is a significant correlation between stress hyperglycemia and early VCI after ischemic stroke.\u76ee\u7684
