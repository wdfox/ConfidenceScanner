As both eGFR and albuminuria are associated with CI risk in CKD, we also seek to determine the extent that eGFR remains a useful biomarker for risk of CI in those with CKD and concomitant albuminuria.Chi-square tests measured the prevalence of severe CI and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) by eGFR level. Logistic regression models and generalized linear models measured risk of CI by eGFR, adjusted for UACR.Participants were 574 adults with a mean age of 69; 433 with CKD (eGFR <60, non-dialysis) and 141 controls (eGFR \u2265 60). Forty-eight percent of participants with CKD had severe CI or MCI. The prevalence of severe CI was highest (25%) in those with eGFR <30. eGFR <30 was only associated with severe CI in those without albuminuria (UACR <30; OR = 3.3; p = .02) and was not associated with MCI in similar models.One quarter of those with eGFR <30 had severe CI. eGFR <30 was associated with over threefold increased odds of severe CI in those with UACR < 30, but not with UACR > 30, suggesting that eGFR < 30 is a valid biomarker for increased risk of severe CI in those without concomitant albuminuria.", "doi": "10.1093/gerona/glx241", "title": "Prevalence and Risk of Severe Cognitive Impairment in Advanced Chronic Kidney Disease.", "journal": ["The journals of gerontology.
