We investigated how the place of death changed between 1998 and 2013 among people with dementia.Data from the Finnish national health and social care registers were extracted for all people with dementia, who had died at 70\u00a0years old during these years (N\u00a0=\u00a0140,034). Descriptive analysis and logistic regression analysis were conducted.In 2013, the most common place of death was the primary care hospital (39.8%), followed by nursing home and sheltered housing with 24-hour assistance (20.5%). Dying at home was rare (8.1%). During the study years, dying in the hospital decreased while dying in sheltered housing with 24-hour assistance increased.The place of death for people with dementia has changed from institutions to noninstitutional care facilities. Further research on noninstitutional care facilities' ability to provide high-quality care at the end of life is needed.", "doi": "10.1016/j.dadm.2017.10.006", "title": "Changes in place of death among people with dementia in Finland between 1998 and 2013: A register study.", "journal": ["Alzheimer's & dementia (Amsterdam, Netherlands)", "Alzheimers Dement (Amst)"]}
