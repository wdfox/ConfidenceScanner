This tendency to say 'no' may also concern the use of assistive technologies such as fall detectors, mobile safety alarms, Internet for social contact and robots. This paper provides practical recommendations for care professionals in home health care and social care about how to respond to such resistiveness towards assistive technologies. Apart from the option of accepting the 'no', it discusses a number of methods for influencing persons with dementia in order to overcome the 'no'. These methods range from various non-coercive measures-including nudging-to coercion. It is argued that while conventional caring measures like those mentioned are essential for survival, health or hygiene, assistive technologies are commonly merely potentially beneficial supplements. With this in mind, it is concluded that care professionals should be more restrictive in using methods of influence involving some degree of pressure regarding assistive technologies than regarding conventional caring measures.", "doi": "10.1007/s11019-017-9816-8", "title": "How to respond to resistiveness towards assistive technologies among persons with dementia.", "journal": ["Medicine, health care, and philosophy", "Med Health Care Philos"]}
