We examined whether physical activity during early adulthood or mid-to-late life is associated with late-life SCF. We followed 28,481 US male health professionals aged 40-75\u00a0years who reported their physical activity in 1986 and biennially thereafter. SCF was reported in 2008 and 2012. The SCF score was averaged for the 2008 and 2012 assessments and categorized as \"good\", \"moderate\", and \"poor\". Men in the highest versus lowest quintile of mid-to-late life physical activity in 1986 had 38% lower odds of poor versus good SCF score (multivariable-adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.62; 95% CI 0.53, 0.72; P for trend\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Being physically active in early adulthood was also associated with a 23% lower odds of poor SCF, independent of later activity, and being active both in early and mid-to-late adulthood was associated with a 48% lower odds of poor SCF score compared with those who were always sedentary (OR 0.52; 95% CI 0.38, 0.71). Our results suggest that being physically active during early adulthood and mid-to-late life independently contribute to prevention of poor subjective cognitive function in late-life.", "doi": "10.1007/s10654-017-0331-2", "title": "Physical activity across adulthood and subjective cognitive function in older men.", "journal": ["European journal of epidemiology", "Eur.
