BMI was assessed at baseline. Dementia was ascertained at follow-up using linkage to electronic health records (N\u00a0=\u00a06894). We assumed BMI is little affected by preclinical dementia\u00a0when assessed decades before dementia onset and much affected when assessed nearer diagnosis.Hazard ratios per 5-kg/m2 increase in BMI for dementia were 0.71 (95% confidence interval\u00a0=\u00a00.66-0.77), 0.94 (0.89-0.99), and 1.16 (1.05-1.27) when BMI was assessed 10\u00a0years, 10-20\u00a0years, and >20\u00a0years before dementia diagnosis.The association between BMI and dementia is likely to be attributable to two different processes: a harmful effect of higher BMI, which is observable in long follow-up, and a reverse-causation effect that makes a higher BMI to appear protective when the follow-up is short.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jalz.2017.09.016", "title": "Body mass index and risk of dementia: Analysis of individual-level data from 1.3 million individuals.", "journal": ["Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association", "Alzheimers Dement"]}
