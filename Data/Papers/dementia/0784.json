However, it has been speculated that infections may play a role in disease progression. Methods We calculated the adjusted anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody (Adj-AChR-Ab) titers (range, 0-1) in 58 MG patients between 2006 and 2012. We determined the relationship between Adj-AChR-Ab titer and infection incidence. Results A cross-correlation function (CCF) analysis of Adj-AChR-Ab titer and incidence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae) (r\u00a0=\u00a00.449, P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and influenza virus (r\u00a0=\u00a00.411, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) infections indicated significant correlations. MG with thymoma was highly correlated with M. pneumoniae infection (r\u00a0=\u00a00.798, P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). The relative risk for Adj-AChR-Ab titer was 1.407 for M. pneumoniae (95% CI, 1.193-1.661 for an increase in one infected patient per monitoring point) and 1.158 for influenza (95% CI, 1.071-1.253 for 100 infected patients). Conclusion Variation of Adj-AChR-Ab titer is significantly influenced by the presence of M. pneumoniae and influenza virus infections.", "doi": "10.1080/01616412.2017.1407021", "title": "Time-series analysis: variation of anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody titer in myasthenia gravis is related to incidence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae and influenza virus infections.", "journal": ["Neurological research", "Neurol.
