The neuroprotective effects of these compounds were further evaluated against H2O2- and A\u03b21-42-induced injury using cell-based assays. The derivatives showed obvious differences in activity due to structural variations, and two of them exhibited better neuroprotective effects than 1 in the A\u03b21-42-induced injury model. Compound 7 was the most active derivative and had a relatively simple chemical structure. Moreover, 1 and 7 can significantly reduce the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and extent of malondialdehyde (MDA) increase resulting from A\u03b21-42 treatment, which demonstrated that these kinds of compounds show neuroprotective effects in Alzheimer's disease (AD) models via modulating oxidative stress. Compound 7 could be used as promising lead for the development of a new type of neuroprotective agent against AD.", "doi": "10.1016/j.ejmech.2017.11.040", "title": "Synthesis, biological evaluation and structure-activity relationship studies of hederacolchiside E and its derivatives as potential anti-Alzheimer agents.", "journal": ["European journal of medicinal chemistry", "Eur J Med Chem"]}
