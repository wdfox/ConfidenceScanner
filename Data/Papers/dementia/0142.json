They were followed up for 2 years. Brief cognitive screening tests were administered to the participants. Longitudinal changes in test performance were evaluated and analyzed.In this longitudinal study, the Scenery Picture Memory Test (SPMT) showed significant changes over 2 years in both MCI and AD participants. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Word Fluency Test-vegetable showed significant changes only in AD participants. Other tests all showed little or no decline in results.The SPMT can be a useful tool for effectively observing changes during follow-up of MCI and AD patients.", "doi": "10.1159/000481910", "title": "Longitudinal Changes in Performance on Cognitive Screening Tests in Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer Disease.", "journal": ["Dementia and geriatric cognitive disorders extra", "Dement Geriatr Cogn Dis Extra"]}
