Here, we reveal that the membrane-associated amyloid precursor protein (APP) is highly expressed in macrophages and microglia, and acts as an innate restriction against HIV-1. APP binds the HIV-1 Gag polyprotein, retains it in lipid rafts and blocks HIV-1 virion production and spread. To escape this restriction, Gag promotes secretase-dependent cleavage of APP, resulting in the overproduction of toxic A\u03b2 isoforms. This Gag-mediated A\u03b2 production results in increased degeneration of primary cortical neurons, and can be prevented by \u03b3-secretase inhibitor treatment. Interfering with HIV-1's evasion of APP-mediated restriction also suppresses HIV-1 spread, offering a potential strategy to both treat infection and prevent HAND.", "doi": "10.1038/s41467-017-01795-8", "title": "HIV-1 counteracts an innate restriction by amyloid precursor protein resulting in neurodegeneration.", "journal": ["Nature communications", "Nat Commun"]}
