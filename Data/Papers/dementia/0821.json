The Risky Wandering and Adverse Outcome model assessed behaviors of eloping and getting lost outside the house for dementia persons. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Pearson's correlation coefficient and hierarchical regressions.The mean age of caregivers was 56.01\u00a0years (SD = 13.8); 65% were female. Younger caregivers experienced greater physical fatigue and sleep disturbance. Presence of foreign helpers predicted a reduction in mental and physical fatigue of caregiver (\u03b2 = -0.186, p < .05; \u03b2 = 0.198, p < .05, respectively). Getting lost outside of the house influenced caregivers' mental fatigue (\u03b2 = 0-0.215, p < .05); eloping behavior influenced caregivers' sleep disturbance (\u03b2 = 0.231, p < .05). Care-receivers' activities of daily living affected caregivers' depressive symptoms (\u03b2 = -0.179, p < .05).Dementia family caregiver physical and mental health problems have distinct predictors. Employing the Risky Wandering and Adverse Outcome model could inform policy makers regarding long-term care resources to improve dementia care.", "doi": "10.1080/13607863.2017.1387764", "title": "Risky wandering behaviors of persons with dementia predict family caregivers' health outcomes.", "journal": ["Aging & mental health", "Aging Ment Health"]}
