Subjects with poor short-term prognosis were excluded. Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated, along with the independent relationship between all-cause mortality and clinical data. Hazard Ratio (HR) was calculated by Cox regression analysis.Mean age of the population was 85 \u00b1 3.7 years, and causes for implantation were atrioventricular block in 51.9% and other bradyarrhythmias in 48.1% of cases. Mean eGFR was 58.3 \u00b1 24 mL/min per 1.73 m2, and mean CCI was 3.65 \u00b1 2.28. Death for all-causes was recorded in 213 subjects. Deceased patients were older, had lower eGFR, higher comorbidity, higher prevalence of myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, dementia and chronic pulmonary disease. Age (HR: 1.081, 95% CI: 1.044-1.119; P < 001), CCI (HR: 1.651, 95% CI: 1.286-2.121, P < 001) and eGFR \u2264 45 mL/min per 1.73 m2 (HR: 1.360, 95% CI: 1.024-1.806; P = 0.033) were predictors of death.Renal dysfunction, as well as comorbidity, impacts negatively survival of older adults treated with pacemaker implantation because of bradyarrhythmias.", "doi": "10.11909/j.issn.1671-5411.2017.10.007", "title": "Impact of chronic kidney disease on mortality in older adults treated with pacemaker implantation.", "journal": ["Journal of geriatric cardiology : JGC", "J Geriatr Cardiol"]}
