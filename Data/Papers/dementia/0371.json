When selecting which screening tool to use in a primary care office, one needs to consider practicality, feasibility, applicability, and psychometric properties. The MIS, MiniCog, PhotoTest, and GPCOG have been found to have short administration times, good accuracy, and applicability for a broad range of patient education and backgrounds. The BAS, MiniCog, PhotoTest and MAT have been found to be the most accurate tests. However, the evidence is limited and more studies need to be done to accurately answer the presented question.", "doi": null, "title": "In patients suspected of cognitive decline, what is the most accurate in-office screening instrument to determine if there is dementia needing further evaluation and management?", "journal": ["The Journal of the Oklahoma State Medical Association", "J Okla State Med Assoc"]}
