Our understanding of its mechanism of action has focused on its capacity to\u00a0potentiate inhibitory systems in the brain.

Using single-particle tracking photoactivation\u00a0localization microscopy, we show that clinically relevant concentrations of propofol and etomidate restrict syntaxin1A mobility on the plasma membrane, whereas non-anesthetic analogs produce the opposite effect and increase syntaxin1A mobility.\u00a0Removing the interaction with the t-SNARE partner\u00a0SNAP-25 abolishes propofol-induced syntaxin1A confinement, indicating that syntaxin1A and SNAP-25 together form an emergent drug target. Impaired syntaxin1A mobility and exocytosis under propofol are both rescued by co-expressing a truncated syntaxin1A construct that interacts with SNAP-25.
