Underpinned by the theory of human caring, the GCM offers a framework for achieving the person/family outcome of well-being by suggesting caring interventions within 4 priority domains: aligning care, keeping safe, comforting body/mind/spirit, and facilitating transitions to persons with late-stage illness, including frailty and dementia. The GCM can be used to inform practice, policy, education, and research.", "doi": "10.1097/ANS.0000000000000195", "title": "Lee Geropalliative Caring Model: A Situation-Specific Theory for Older Adults.", "journal": ["ANS.
