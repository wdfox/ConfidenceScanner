To avoid potential practice effects with repeated administration, here we present alternative versions of the ECAS suitable for measuring change over time.To develop two alternate versions of the ECAS: ECAS-B and ECAS-C.One hundred and forty-nine healthy adult participants were recruited. Thirty participants completed a pilot study in developing the alternate versions. Two groups of 40 participants were administered the ECAS-B or ECAS-C and compared to published data of the original ECAS (ECAS-A) to determine equivalence. An additional 39 participants were administered the ECAS consecutively, either repeating the original version (ECAS-A-A-A) serially or the different versions (ECAS-A-B-C) to determine potential practice effects. Recordings of assessments were scored by a second researcher to determine inter-rater reliability.No significant differences were found between versions (A, B, C) of the composite performance measures of ALS Specific, ALS Non-Specific, and ECAS Total scores. Repeated serial administration of ECAS-A (A-A-A) produced some practice effects for composite scores, whereas no such effects were found when alternate versions were administered serially (A-B-C). Exceptionally high intra-class correlations were found for all three versions of the ECAS suggesting a high degree of rater agreement.The newly developed alternate forms of the ECAS are both highly equitable to the original ECAS-A and enable avoidance of practice effects, thus supporting their use in measuring cognition and behaviour over time.", "doi": "10.1080/21678421.2017.1407793", "title": "ECAS A-B-C: alternate forms of the Edinburgh Cognitive and Behavioural ALS Screen.", "journal": ["Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis & frontotemporal degeneration", "Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener"]}
