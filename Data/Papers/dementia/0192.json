In addition, glial activation has been found in AD brains, although the precise pathological role of astrocytes remains unclear. Here, we identified kallikrein-related peptidase 7 (KLK7) as an astrocyte-derived A\u03b2 degrading enzyme. Expression of KLK7 mRNA was significantly decreased in the brains of AD patients. Ablation of Klk7 exacerbated the thioflavin S-positive A\u03b2 pathology in AD model mice. The expression of Klk7 was upregulated by A\u03b2 treatment in the primary astrocyte, suggesting that Klk7 is homeostatically modulated by A\u03b2-induced responses. Finally, we found that the Food and Drug Administration-approved anti-dementia drug memantine can increase the expression of Klk7 and A\u03b2 degradation activity specifically in the astrocytes. These data suggest that KLK7 is an important enzyme in the degradation and clearance of deposited A\u03b2 species by astrocytes involved in the pathogenesis of\u00a0AD.", "doi": "10.15252/emmm.201708184", "journal": ["EMBO molecular medicine", "EMBO Mol Med"], "date": "2018-01-18_23:41:19"}
