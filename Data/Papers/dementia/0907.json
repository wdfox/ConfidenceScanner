Studying the associations between vascular and neuronal changes in the retina and dementia could improve our understanding of dementia and, potentially, aid in diagnosis and risk assessment.\u00a0 This protocol aims to describe a method of quantifying and analyzing retinal vasculature and neuronal structure, which are potentially associated with dementia. This protocol also provides examples of retinal changes in subjects with dementia, and discusses technical issues and current limitations of retinal imaging.", "doi": "10.3791/56137", "title": "Using Retinal Imaging to Study Dementia.", "journal": ["Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "J Vis Exp"]}
