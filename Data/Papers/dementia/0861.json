Cerebral \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) deposition is the major pathological hallmark of AD. Recent studies also have shown that the serum level of phosphorus correlates to the risk of incident dementia. To date, the linkage between cerebral A\u03b2 deposition and the serum phosphorus level remains unknown. In this study, we analyzed the levels of serum phosphorus in 109 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 73 AD dementia (ADD) subjects. All subjects underwent Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography (PiB-PET) imaging to measure cerebral A\u03b2 deposition. The results with A\u03b2 deposition was compared with the serum levels of phosphorus. The subjects with cerebral A\u03b2 deposition showed lower levels of serum phosphorus than those without A\u03b2 deposition. Furthermore, multiple regression analyses showed that a low level of serum phosphorus correlated with cerebral A\u03b2 deposition, even when age, sex, apolipoprotein E \u03b54 genotype, and MMSE z-score were controlled for. Serum levels of other ions, including calcium, iron, zinc, and copper, showed no such correlation. In conclusion, our results suggest that the serum level of phosphorus may be used as an easily accessible blood biomarker for cerebral A\u03b2 deposition in a cognitively impaired population.", "doi": "10.3389/fnagi.2017.00362", "title": "Low Serum Phosphorus Correlates with Cerebral A\u03b2 Deposition in Cognitively Impaired Subjects: Results from the KBASE Study.", "journal": ["Frontiers in aging neuroscience", "Front Aging Neurosci"]}
