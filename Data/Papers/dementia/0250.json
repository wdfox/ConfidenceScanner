There are two major pathological hallmarks that contribute to the pathogenesis of AD which are the presence of extracellular amyloid plaques composed of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau. Despite extensive research that has been done on A\u03b2 in the last two decades, therapies targeting A\u03b2 were not very fruitful at treating AD as the efficacy of A\u03b2 therapies observed in animal models is not reflected in human clinical trials. Hence, tau-directed therapies have received tremendous attention as the potential treatments for AD. Tauopathies are closely correlated with dementia and immunotherapy has been effective at reducing tau pathology and improving cognitive deficits in animal models.
