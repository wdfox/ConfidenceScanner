We recently found that the neuronal phosphoprotein synapsin III (syn III) controls dopamine release via cooperation with \u03b1-syn and modulates \u03b1-syn aggregation. Here, we observed that LB and LN, in the substantia nigra of PD patients and hippocampus of one subject with DLB, displayed a marked immunopositivity for syn III. The in situ proximity ligation assay revealed the accumulation of numerous proteinase K-resistant neuropathological inclusions that contained both \u03b1-syn and syn III in tight association in the brain of affected subjects. Most strikingly, syn III was identified as a component of \u03b1-syn-positive fibrils in LB-enriched protein extracts from PD brains. Finally, a positive correlation between syn III and \u03b1-syn levels was detected in the caudate putamen of PD subjects. Collectively, these findings indicate that syn III is a crucial \u03b1-syn interactant and a key component of LB fibrils in the brain of patients affected by PD.
