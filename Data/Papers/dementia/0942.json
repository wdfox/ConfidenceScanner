Fifty-two older people ( M\u2009=\u200986.7 years, SD\u2009=\u20097.3) diagnosed with moderate-to-severe dementia living in four nursing homes in Spain participated in the study. The intervention was implemented with 27 residents at two of the nursing homes; the other 25 cases at the other two homes acted as controls. A proxy measure of quality of life was used. Improvements were found in quality of life as assessed by staff members, in both within and between-group comparisons, which suggests that including older people with dementia in care-planning meetings may improve their quality of life. However, further controlled studies are needed to confirm these preliminary results.", "doi": "10.1177/1471301217695381", "title": "Involving institutionalized people with dementia in their care-planning meetings: Impact on their quality of life measured by a proxy method.", "journal": ["Dementia (London, England)", "Dementia (London)"]}
