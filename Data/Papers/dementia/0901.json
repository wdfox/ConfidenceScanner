Seventeen CNA-resident dyads participated in this pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT). Control and experimental group CNAs received a 25-minute traditional lecture. Experimental group CNAs also underwent three coaching sessions over 4 weeks. There were significant between-group differences in the percentage of dyads who had improved scores for appropriateness of LoA use and dressing independence from pretest to posttest (experimental: n = 9, 100%; control: n = 8, 50%; p = 0.029). However, there were no statistically significant median differences between groups in appropriateness of LoA use by CNAs and resident dressing independence scores. There were significant within-group median improvements in appropriateness of LoA use (p = 0.004) and independence of dressing scores (p = 0.004) between pretest and posttest in the experimental group, but not in the control group. This initial pilot RCT supports coach training as a method to improve appropriate use of LoA strategies by CNAs and independence of resident dressing.
