Dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-(HPA) axis has been reported in affective disorders and AD. Recent studies revealed that current antidepressant drugs are not completely effective for treating anxiety- and depression-related disorders in people with dementia. ATP-sensitive-potassium-(KATP) channels are well-known to be involved in AD pathophysiology, HPA axis function and the pathogenesis of depression and anxiety-related behaviors. Thus, targeting of KATP channel may be a potential therapeutic strategy in AD. Hence, we investigated the effects of intracerebroventricular injection of A\u03b225-35 alone or in combination with glibenclamide, KATP channel inhibitor on depression- and anxiety-related behaviors as well as HPA axis response to stress in rats. To do this, non-A\u03b225-35- and A\u03b225-35-treated rats were orally treated with glibenclamide, then the behavioral consequences were assessed using sucrose preference, forced swim, light-dark box and plus maze tests. Stress-induced corticosterone levels following forced swim and plus maze tests were also evaluated as indicative of abnormal HPA-axis-function. A\u03b225-35 induced HPA axis hyperreactivity and increased depression- and anxiety-related symptoms in rats. Our results showed that blockade of KATP channels with glibenclamide decreased depression- and anxiety-related behaviors by normalizing HPA axis activity in A\u03b225-35-treated rats. This study provides additional evidence that A\u03b2 administration can induce depression- and anxiety-like symptoms in rodents, and suggests that KATP channel inhibitors may be a plausible therapeutic strategy for treating affective disorders in AD patients.", "doi": "10.1016/j.brainresbull.2018.01.001", "journal": ["Brain research bulletin", "Brain Res.
