In addition, we evaluated a possible role of TMEM106B rs1990622 as a genetic modifier and correlated progranulin plasma levels and gray-matter atrophy. Plasma progranulin mean \u00b1 SD plasma levels in patients and asymptomatic carriers were significantly decreased compared with noncarriers (30.5 \u00b1 13.0 and 27.7 \u00b1 7.5 versus 99.6 \u00b1 24.8\u00a0ng/mL, p < 0.00001). Considering the threshold of >61.55\u00a0ng/mL, the test had a sensitivity of 98.8% and a specificity of 97.5% in predicting the presence of a mutation, independent of symptoms. No correlations were found between progranulin plasma levels and age, years from average age at onset in each family, or TMEM106B rs1990622 genotype (p > 0.05). Plasma progranulin levels did not correlate with brain atrophy.
