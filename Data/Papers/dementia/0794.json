Among these derivatives, compound 1b displayed good selective inhibitory activity against AChE (vs BuChE, IC50\u00a0=\u00a00.324\u00a0\u03bcM, SI\u00a0>\u00a0123) and MAO-B (vs MAO-A, IC50\u00a0=\u00a01.427\u00a0\u03bcM, SI\u00a0>\u00a035). Molecular docking study showed that the pyrimidinylthiourea moiety of 1b could bind to the catalytic active site (CAS) of AChE, and the propargylamine moiety interacted directly with the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) of MAO-B. Moreover, 1b demonstrated mild antioxidant ability, good copper chelating property, effective inhibitory activity against Cu2+-induced A\u03b21-42 aggregation, moderate neuroprotection, low cytotoxicity, and appropriate blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability in\u00a0vitro and was capable of ameliorating scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment in mice. These results indicated that 1b has the potential to be a multifunctional candidate for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.", "doi": "10.1016/j.ejmech.2017.08.025", "title": "Discovery of novel propargylamine-modified 4-aminoalkyl imidazole substituted pyrimidinylthiourea derivatives as multifunctional agents for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.", "journal": ["European journal of medicinal chemistry", "Eur J Med Chem"]}
