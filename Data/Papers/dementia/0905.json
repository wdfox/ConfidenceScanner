We previously designed an antibody fragment, scFv-h3D6, and showed that it precludes A\u03b2-induced cytotoxicity by withdrawing A\u03b2 oligomers from the amyloid pathway towards a non-toxic, worm-like pathway. ScFv-h3D6 was effective at the behavioral, cellular, and molecular levels in the 3xTg-AD mouse model. Because scFv-h3D6 treatment restored apolipoprotein E (apoE) and J (apoJ) concentrations to non-pathological values, and A\u03b2 internalization by glial cells was found to be decreased in the presence of these apolipoproteins, we now aimed to test the influence of scFv-h3D6 on A\u03b2 aggregation and cellular uptake by primary human astrocytes in the presence of therapeutic apoE and apoJ mimetic peptides (MPs). Firstly, we demonstrated by CD and FTIR that the molecules used in this work were well folded. Next, interactions between apoE or apoJ-MP, scFv-h3D6 and A\u03b2 were studied by CD. The conformational change induced by the interaction of A\u03b2 with apoE-MP was much bigger than the induced with apoJ-MP, in line with the observed formation of protective worm-like fibrils by the scFv-h3D6/A\u03b2 complex in the presence of apoJ-MP, but not of apoE-MP. ScFv-h3D6, apoJ-MP, and apoE-MP to a different extent reduced A\u03b2 uptake by astrocytes, and apoE-MP partially interfered with the dramatic reduction by scFv-h3D6 while apoJ-MP had no effect on scFv-h3D6 action. As sustained A\u03b2 uptake by astrocytes may impair their normal functions, and ultimately neuronal viability, this work shows another beneficence of scFv-h3D6 treatment, which is not further improved by the use of apoE or apoJ mimetic peptides.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0188191", "title": "Effects of an A\u03b2-antibody fragment on A\u03b2 aggregation and astrocytic uptake are modulated by apolipoprotein E and J mimetic peptides.", "journal": ["PloS one", "PLoS ONE"]}
