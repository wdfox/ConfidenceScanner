The main purpose of this prospective study was to analyse sequential changes in oxidative stress during CAS and their relationship to clinical factors.Twenty-two consecutive CAS procedures were performed between May 2014 and April 2016. Arterial blood was collected four times: (1) after the sheath insertion without edaravone; (2) pre-angioplasty with edaravone from the carotid artery; (3) after post-stenting angioplasty from an occluded carotid artery; and (4) before sheath removal. Derivatives of reactive oxygen metabolites (d-ROMs) and biological antioxidant potential (BAP) were measured photometrically. The relationship between d-ROMs or BAP and preoperatively investigated biochemical parameters, cognitive function, and number of diffusion-weighted image (DWI) high spot lesions was analysed using one-way ANOVA and the Tukey-Kramer HSD test.The d-ROM values for CAS were 355\u00b158.8 Carratelli Units at sheath insertion, 315\u00b157.2 after edaravone infusion, 328\u00b156.8 after post-stenting angioplasty, and 315\u00b153.0\u2009just before sheath removal. The d-ROM values were reduced significantly after edaravone infusion (P<0.05). The BAP at sheath insertion was reduced significantly according to age (P<0.05). The d-ROMs at sheath insertion correlated negatively with the dementia scale and positively with the post-CAS DWI high spots (1.00\u00b11.07; P<0.05). Other biochemical parameters did not correlate with the d-ROM values or BAP.Oxidative stress is correlated negatively with cognitive function and positively with postoperative ischemic lesions.
