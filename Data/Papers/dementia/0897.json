We measured markers of DNA and RNA damage from oxidation (8-oxodG and 8-oxoGuo, respectively) in cerebrospinal fluid from 45 patients with SAH on day 1-14 after ictus and 45 age-matched healthy control subjects. At baseline, both markers were significantly increased in patients compared to controls (p values\u2009<\u2009.001), and exhibited a progressive further increase (to >20-fold above control levels) from day 5-14. None of the markers predicted the occurrence of vasospasms or mortality, although there was a trend that the 8-oxoGuo marker was more strongly associated with mortality than the 8-oxodG marker. We conclude that SAH leads to a massive increase in damage to nucleic acids from oxidative stress, which is likely to play a role in neuronal dysfunction and death. As only patients in need of a ventriculostomy catheter were included in the study, the findings cannot necessarily be extrapolated to all patients with SAH.", "doi": "10.1080/10715762.2017.1407413", "title": "Progressive DNA and RNA damage from oxidation after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage in humans.", "journal": ["Free radical research", "Free Radic.
