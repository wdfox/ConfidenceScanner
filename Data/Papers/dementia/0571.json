For instance, a survey in the USA showed that misdiagnosis was common in patients with Lewy body dementia who, on average, saw at least three physicians over a year's time or more before getting the proper diagnosis (Lewy Body Dementia Association, 2010). Furthermore, in multiethnic communities, cultural and language barriers between practitioners and patients may lead to substantial delay as well (Sayegh and Knight, 2013).", "doi": "10.1017/S1041610217002757", "title": "Improving diagnostic communication in dementia.", "journal": ["International psychogeriatrics", "Int Psychogeriatr"]}
