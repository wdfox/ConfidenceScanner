The DNP carried out screenings at the clinic using an IT device (iPad), and sent the results to a dementia specialist at the Mie University Hospital Dementia Center. The dementia specialist assessed the results of the screening tests, and made a treatment recommendation for a follow-up consultation with a memory clinic or continuing observation by the family clinic. The DNP reported the recommendation of the dementia specialist to the family clinic physician, who provided this information to the patients/caregiver(s). We investigated the characteristics of the patients referred for consultation with the memory clinic.A total of 158 patients participated in the screening.
