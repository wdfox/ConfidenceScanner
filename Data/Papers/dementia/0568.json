Innotest assay values of A\u03b2 1-42 have gradually increased over the past 2 decades, which might lead to misclassification of AD when a single cutpoint for abnormality is used. We propose an unbiased approach to statistically correct for drift.We determined year-specific cutpoints with Gaussian mixture modeling, based on the cross-section of bimodal distributions of A\u03b2 1-42 concentrations in 4397 memory clinic patients. This allowed us to realign year-specific cutpoints as an unbiased method to remove drift from the data. Sensitivity and specificity to detect AD dementia were compared between corrected and uncorrected values.A\u03b2 1-42 values increased 22 pg/mL annually, and this could not be explained by changes in cohort composition. Our approach removed time dependencies [\u03b2 (SE) = 0.07 (0.59); P = 0.91]. Statistically correcting for drift improved the sensitivity to detect AD dementia to 0.90 (95% CI, 0.89-0.92) from at least 0.66 (95% CI, 0.64-0.69) based on uncorrected data. Specificity became lower (0.69; 95% CI, 0.67-0.70) vs at most 0.80 (95% CI, 0.79-0.82) for uncorrected data.This approach may also be useful to standardize A\u03b2 1-42 CSF concentrations across different centers and/or platforms, and to optimize use of CSF biomarker data collected over a long period.", "doi": "10.1373/clinchem.2017.281055", "title": "Unbiased Approach to Counteract Upward Drift in Cerebrospinal Fluid Amyloid-\u03b2 1-42 Analysis Results.", "journal": ["Clinical chemistry", "Clin.
