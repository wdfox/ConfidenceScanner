Among the dementias, Alzheimer&amp;#039;s stands out because of its extremely high incidence and fatality. Several pharmacological strategies have been tried but up to day, Alzheimer keeps being an untreatable disease. In literature, the number of QSAR-related Alzheimer's new drug design attempts is huge, but only few results can be considered noteworthy. Providing a detailed analysis of the actual situation and reporting the most notable results in the field of drug design and discovery, the current review focuses on the potential of molecular topology as a reliable tool in finding new anti-Alzheimer lead compounds.", "doi": "10.2174/1570159X15666171129102042", "title": "Alzheimer: A decade of drug design.
