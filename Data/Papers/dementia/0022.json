However, previous results were conflicting. We aim to investigate the association of 5-HT2A T102C with BPSD in AD using a meta-analysis. Studies were collected using PubMed, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library databases, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Embase. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess associations. Nine studies with 1899 AD patients with/without BPSD were included in this meta-analysis. The 102C and CC genotypes were associated with psychosis in AD (102C: p < 0.00001, OR [95% CI] = 3.19 [2.12-4.79]; CC: p < 0.00001, OR [95% CI] = 7.24 [3.60-14.59]). The TT genotype was significantly associated with hallucinations, aberrant motor behavior, and psychosis in AD (hallucinations: p = 0.001, OR [95% CI] = 0.52 [0.36-0.77]; aberrant motor behavior: p = 0.03, OR [95% CI] = 0.58 [0.35-0.95]; and psychosis: p = 0.002, OR [95% CI] = 0.34 [0.17-0.67]). No association was observed between T102C alleles or genotypes and delusions, agitation/aggression, depression, and apathy (p > 0.05). Thus, the 5HT2A T102C might be a susceptible factor for hallucinations, aberrant motor behavior, and psychosis in AD. The potential mechanism of this polymorphism in BPSD in AD requires further exploration.", "doi": "10.1155/2017/5320135", "title": "The Association between 5HT2A T102C and Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia in Alzheimer's Disease: A Meta-Analysis.", "journal": ["BioMed research international", "Biomed Res Int"]}
