We examined whether three different types of cognitive training lowered the risk of dementia across 10 years of follow-up relative to control and if greater number of training sessions attended was associated with lower dementia risk.The Advanced Cognitive Training in Vital Elderly (NCT00298558) study was a randomized controlled trial (N\u00a0=\u00a02802) among initially healthy older adults, which examined the efficacy of three cognitive training programs (memory, reasoning, or speed of processing) relative to a no-contact control condition. Up to 10 training sessions were delivered over 6 weeks with up to four sessions of booster training delivered at 11\u00a0months and a second set of up to four booster sessions at 35\u00a0months. Outcome assessments were taken immediately after intervention and at intervals over 10\u00a0years. Dementia was defined using a combination of interview- and performance-based methods.A total of 260 cases of dementia were identified during the follow-up. Speed training resulted in reduced risk of dementia (hazard ratio [HR] 0.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.50-0.998, P\u00a0=\u00a0.049) compared to control, but memory and reasoning training did not (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.57-1.11, P\u00a0=\u00a0.177 and HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.56-1.10, P\u00a0=\u00a0.163, respectively). Each additional speed training session was associated with a 10% lower hazard for dementia (unadjusted HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.85-0.95, P\u00a0<\u00a0.001).Initially, healthy older adults randomized to speed of processing cognitive training had a 29% reduction in their risk of dementia after 10\u00a0years of follow-up compared to the untreated control group.", "doi": "10.1016/j.trci.2017.09.002", "title": "Speed of processing training results in lower risk of dementia.", "journal": ["Alzheimer's & dementia (New York, N.
