Cognition was measured using the 6-Item-Cognitive-Impairment-Test ('6CIT'). Cognitive impairment was defined as 6CIT \u226511, self-reported dementia or the inability to perform the cognition test. The composite adverse outcome after 3 and 12 months was defined as a 1-point decrease in Katz Activities of Daily Living (ADL), new institutionalisation or mortality. Multivariable regression analysis was used to assess whether cognitive impairment independently associates with adverse outcome.of 2,130 included patients, 588 (27.6%) had cognitive impairment at baseline and 654 patients (30.7%) suffered from adverse outcome after 3 months. Cognitive impairment associated with increased risk for adverse outcome (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.72, 95%CI 1.37-2.17). After 12 months, 787 patients (36.9%) suffered from adverse outcome. Again, cognitive impairment independently associated with increased risk for adverse outcome (adjusted OR 1.89, 95%CI 1.46-2.46).
