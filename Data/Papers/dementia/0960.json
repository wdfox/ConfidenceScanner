In the present study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of CTS using primary cultured rat cortical neurons. CTS (250-1000\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) inhibited neuronal death induced by 100\u00a0\u03bcM glutamate. This glutamate-induced neuronal death was blocked by a GluN2B-, but not GluN2A-containing NMDA receptor antagonist. Therefore, the neuroprotective effects of CTS were related to an inhibition of GluN2B-containing NMDA receptor-mediated responses.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jphs.2017.10.009", "title": "Neuroprotection by chotosan, a Kampo formula, against glutamate excitotoxicity involves the inhibition of GluN2B-, but not GluN2A-containing NMDA receptor-mediated responses in primary cultured cortical neurons.", "journal": ["Journal of pharmacological sciences", "J.
