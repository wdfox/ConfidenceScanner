Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs; Braak stage) and neuritic plaques (NPs) were staged at autopsy in a subset of participants (n\u2009=\u2009149) using current standard neuropathologic diagnostic criteria.Moderate drinking men had an attenuated rate of decline compared to rare/never drinkers and women on the MMSE and CDR sum of boxes. In contrast, moderate drinking women had a reduced rate of decline only in the Logical Memory Delayed Recall Test (LMDR) compared to rare/never drinkers and men. Moderate alcohol consumption was associated with a reduction in the incidence of advanced (stages 5-6) Braak NFT stage in men (p\u2009<\u20090.05), with no effect in women.In this cohort, men experienced a broader range of beneficial effects associated with alcohol. Alcohol's effects may differ in men and women in important ways that suggest a narrower beneficial window.", "doi": "10.1007/s00213-017-4791-6", "title": "Sex differences in the association of alcohol with cognitive decline and brain pathology in a cohort of octogenarians.", "journal": ["Psychopharmacology", "Psychopharmacology (Berl.)"]}
