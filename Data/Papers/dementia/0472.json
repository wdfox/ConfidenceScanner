Then, reliability was assessed in a group of 100 healthy controls and patients with AD, 52 with primary progressive aphasia and 22 with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia.The conversion table between ACE-III and MMSE denoted a high reliability, with intra-class correlation coefficients of 0.940, 0.922, and 0.902 in the groups of healthy controls and AD, behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, and primary progressive aphasia, respectively.Our conversion table between ACE-III and MMSE suggests that MMSE may be estimated based on the ACE-III score, which could be useful for clinical and research purposes.", "doi": "10.1017/S104161021700268X", "title": "Conversion between Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination III and Mini-Mental State Examination.", "journal": ["International psychogeriatrics", "Int Psychogeriatr"]}
