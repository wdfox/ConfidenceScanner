A prototype of Webnovela Mirela was tested in a pilot study with 25 Hispanic/Latino dementia caregivers, 19 of whom completed the study.Data were analyzed using paired-samples t-tests. Results indicated a significant decrease from pre- to post-treatment in levels of stress and symptoms of depression (p\u00a0=\u00a0.045).The pilot study indicated high potential of the Webnovela Mirela to help the target population and demonstrated that the telenovela format is acceptable and helpful for Hispanic dementia caregivers.Study outcomes suggested that self-paced approaches with culturally relevant content in an appealing format for the target population have the potential to implement effective interventions. Furthermore, technology enables support programs to reach a broader audience in a cost-effective manner. Of note is the fact that minimal professional and/or personal assistance was required for caregivers to complete this intervention.", "doi": "10.1080/07317115.2017.1377797", "title": "Helping Hispanic Dementia Caregivers Cope with Stress Using Technology-based Resources.", "journal": ["Clinical gerontologist", "Clin Gerontol"]}
