It is believed that AD-related pathology is mostly due to the overproduction of A\u03b2, especially the oligomeric form (A\u03b2O), in the brain. Evidence of the effects of multifunctional medicinal herbs in the treatment of AD has been steadily increasing. Optimized-SopungSunkiwon (OSS), a multiherbal formulation that is composed of six medicinal herbs derived from SopungSunkiwon, is a traditional medicine that is prescribed for neurodegenerative disorders in elderly patients. We previously reported that OSS showed an antiamnesic and memory enhancing effect in mice, but it is unknown whether OSS has a protective effect against A\u03b2O neurotoxicity. In this study, we investigated the effects of OSS in AD models induced by A\u03b2O in vitro and in vivo. We found that OSS protected neuronal cells and inhibited the generation of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species against A\u03b2O toxicity in vitro. These results were confirmed by in vivo data that oral administration of OSS for 14 days attenuated memory impairments and neuronal cell death by modulating gliosis, glutathione depletion, and synaptic damage in the mouse hippocampus induced by A\u03b2O.", "doi": "10.1155/2017/7601486", "title": "Optimized-SopungSunkiwon, a Herbal Formula, Attenuates A\u03b2 Oligomer-Induced Neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's Disease Models.", "journal": ["Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM", "Evid Based Complement Alternat Med"]}
