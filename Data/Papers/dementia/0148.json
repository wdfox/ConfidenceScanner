Prophylactic treatment was not applied for patients with residual tumor, but salvage treatment was performed if tumor progression was identified within the follow-up period.

Comparison of gross total removal (n\u2009=\u200922) and non-total removal (n\u2009=\u200931) groups showed significantly longer progression-free period in the former group (P\u2009<\u20090.001). As salvage treatment gamma knife radiosurgery was applied for 11 patients resulting in 10 patients remaining progression-free and regrowth in 1 patient. Fractionated irradiation was applied for 10 patients, resulting in 2 patients remaining progression-free, deaths in 5 patients including 3 of transformation to pituitary carcinoma, dementia in 1 patient caused by frontal lobe dysfunction, and progression in 2 patients requiring additional surgery and gamma knife radiosurgery. Temozolomide was administered in 2 patients, resulting in deaths in both patients including 1 transformation to pituitary carcinoma. Total removal and gamma knife radiosurgery can result in good outcome. However, the prognosis is extremely poor for patients inadequate for gamma knife radiosurgery.
