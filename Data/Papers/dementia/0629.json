Dementia is a slowly creeping illness, which causes a loss of memory. In addition to this loss of cognitive functions, there is also the death of neural cells, which in turn leads to completely different symptoms. This leads to the appearance of BPSD (Behavioural and psychotic symptoms of dementia). There are guides to the therapy of cognitive deficits of dementia in existence, to use them within the EbM criteria. There exists only a little bit of information on the therapy of BPSD. Therefore I will talk in his article mainly about possibilities of therapy, that were found through medical experience. For those possibilities is only little evidence and are mostly off label, because the field of dementia patients has almost no studies, except pharmaceutical ones. The cause for this lack of studies is probably found in the huge Workload by the ethic commission of every study, which are today the norm for every single study. So please take my work as a foundation for discussion, though which you search for the most optimal solution for the individual problem of your patient.", "doi": "10.24869/psyd.2017.515", "title": "[Sudden Crisis in Dementia].", "journal": ["Psychiatria Danubina", "Psychiatr Danub"]}
