A modified thematic analysis of in-depth interviews with 15 caregivers, ranging in age from 50 to 75 years, including spouses, daughters, sons, cousins, and a friend, from three minority groups-African American, Hispanic, and South Korean caregivers-was conducted by a team of multi-lingual researchers. Caregiver stress was pervasive across all subgroups. Several themes emerged that were qualitatively different across groups, including knowledge about dementia, language barriers, religion and spirituality, and cultural differences in attitudes about caring and formal services. A two-pronged intervention model that includes a generic intervention to reduce caregiver stress along with a culturally targeted intervention tailored to a family's language, food preferences, religious practices, gender norms, and other values was recommended to more successfully reach and support these caregivers.", "doi": "10.1177/1471301217721304", "title": "At the intersection of culture: Ethnically diverse dementia caregivers' service use.", "journal": ["Dementia (London, England)", "Dementia (London)"]}
