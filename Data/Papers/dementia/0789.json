In order to provide reference data and theoretical guidance for the prevention and treatment of VCI after stroke in the area.Stratified multi-stage random sampling was used to extract 6 regions of Inner Mongolia as the first sampling cluster; and then the corresponding banners (counties) were selected randomly as the secondary sampling cluster; according to the number of patient required to investigation, the corresponding number of communities was randomly selected from the secondary sampling cluster. According to the diagnostic criteria of \"Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of vascular cognitive impairment\" and NINDS-AIREN, we screened all stroke patients aged 45 or older from each community, a total of 444 patients participated in the questionnaire and various scaleassessment.The prevalence of VCI, VCIND and VD was 80.41%, 34.46% and 45.95% respectively. The prevalence of VCI in stroke was significantly different in different nationality, age and education level (P<0.05), and there was no significant difference in gender, occupation, marital status and family structure (P>0.05).The prevalence of VCI after stroke was higher in Inner Mongolia, and VCI had a relatively high morbidity in old age people and person with less education in Chinese Han population.", "doi": "10.1080/00207454.2017.1408615", "title": "Study on epidemiology of cognitive dysfunction after stroke in the population over the age of 45 in Inner Mongolia.", "journal": ["The International journal of neuroscience", "Int.
