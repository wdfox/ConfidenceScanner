One care consultant received referrals from individual physicians, while the other, employed by a health plan, received referrals from health plan case managers. Through key informant interviews, focus groups, and physician and caregiver surveys, we identified key issues, finding high rates of stakeholder satisfaction, but some practical issues around information sharing and data tracking. We further found the health plan model of collaboration to offer significant potential for the systematic and early detection of potential clients, provided investments in minor systems change. The Dementia Care Coordination Program, therefore, represents a minimalist model of dementia-specific support, which could be further supplemented via more focused outreach and education.", "doi": "10.1177/1471301217697466", "title": "The Dementia Care Coordination Program: Engaging health systems in caregiver supports.", "journal": ["Dementia (London, England)", "Dementia (London)"]}
