Thus, besides olfactory dysfunctions, it is conceivable that the compromise of these structures can lead to cognitive impairment. The olfactory bulb is affected by alpha-synuclein pathology in almost all cases of both Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. The clinical distinction between these disorders relies on the timing in the appearance of dementia in relationship to motor symptoms. Typically, it occurs late in the course of Parkinson's disease, and within the first year in dementia with Lewy bodies. The close anatomical proximity of the olfactory bulb with limbic regions, together with the early occurrence of cognitive impairment that is observed in dementia with Lewy bodies, raise the question whether the propagation of alpha-synuclein pathology in this condition might originate in the olfactory bulb, spreading from there to other limbic structures, and thereby reaching the associative neocortex. This review will describe the anatomical basis of the olfactory system and discuss the evidence of potential spreading pathways from the olfactory bulb that could support the presence of early dementia in the setting of Lewy body disorders.", "doi": "10.1007/s00441-017-2733-6", "title": "Propagation of alpha-synuclein pathology from the olfactory bulb: possible role in the pathogenesis of dementia with Lewy bodies.", "journal": ["Cell and tissue research", "Cell Tissue Res."]}
