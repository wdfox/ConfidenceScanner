Data collected included: age, sex, years of formal education, Mini-Mental Status Examination score from initial visit, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale score, Self-Rating of Memory Scale, alcohol consumption, marital status, hours per week of work, past medical history, sleep concerns, and family history of memory concerns. The two groups were compared using t-tests and \u03c72 tests. The same comparison was done between the same set of \"worried well\" patients (cognitively normal, N=81) and the subgroup of patients with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (N=146) from the \"other\" group.Significant differences included younger age, more formal education, more frequently having previous psychiatric diagnosis and more self-reported alcohol consumption in the \"worried well\" group. The \"worried well\" and \"Alzheimer's disease\" comparison had the same significant differences as the \"worried well\" and \"other\" comparison.We observed a pattern of differences unfold between the \"worried well\" patients and those with cognitive disease. No one variable was pathognomonic of a \"worried well\" patient. However, taking all the above into account when evaluating a patient may help clinically.", "doi": "10.1017/cjn.2017.267", "title": "The Worried Well?
