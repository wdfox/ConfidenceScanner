We detected ATXN1 alleles with \u226533 polyglutamine repeats in 105 of 1146 patients (9.16%) and 29 of 529 controls (5.48%) (p\u00a0= 0.003). The frequency of ATXN1 alleles with \u226533 polyglutamine repeats was particularly high in the group of ALS patients carrying the C9orf72 expansion (12/59, 20.3%). We confirmed this result in an independent cohort of C9orf72 Italian patients (10/80 cases, 12.5%), thus finding a cumulative frequency of ATXN1 expansion of 15.82% in C9orf72 carriers (p\u00a0= 2.40E-05). Our results strongly support the hypothesis that ATXN1 could act as a disease risk gene in ALS, mostly in C9orf72 expansion carriers. Further studies are needed to confirm our results and to define the mechanism by which ATXN1 might contribute to neuronal degeneration leading to ALS.", "doi": "10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2017.11.011", "title": "ATXN1 intermediate-length polyglutamine expansions are associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.", "journal": ["Neurobiology of aging", "Neurobiol.
