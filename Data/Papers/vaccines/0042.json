Therefore, these cells are rational targets for cancer immunotherapy. Here, we demonstrate that CD122 monoclonal antibody (mAb; aCD122) therapy significantly suppressed tumor growth and improved long-term survival in tumor-bearing mice. This therapeutic effect correlated with enhanced polyfunctional, cytolytic intratumoral CD8+ T cells and a decrease in granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (G-MDSCs). In addition, aCD122 treatment synergized with a vaccine to augment vaccine-induced antigen (Ag)-specific CD8+ T cell responses, reject established tumors and generate memory T cells. Furthermore, aCD122 mAb synergized with an anti-GITR (aGITR) mAb to confer significant control of tumor growth. These results suggest CD122 might be a promising target for cancer immunotherapy, either as a single agent or in combination with other forms of immunotherapy.", "doi": "10.18632/oncotarget.22642", "title": "Targeting of CD122 enhances antitumor immunity by altering the tumor immune environment.", "journal": ["Oncotarget", "Oncotarget"]}
