Although tuberculosis vaccines elicit protective immunity in animals, few provide durable protection. To understand why protection is transient, we evaluated the ability of memory CD4+ T cells to expand, differentiate, and control Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Both na\u00efve and memory CD4+ T cells initially proliferated exponentially, and the accumulation of memory T cells in the lung correlated with early bacterial control. However, later during infection, memory CD4+ T cell proliferation was curtailed and no protection was observed. We show that memory CD4+ T cells are first activated in the LN and their recruitment to the lung attenuates bacterial growth. However, their interaction with Mtb-infected macrophages does not promote continued proliferation. We conclude that a lack of sustained expansion by memory-derived T cells in the lung limits the durability of their protection, linking their slower expansion with transient protection in vaccinated mice.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.ppat.1006704", "title": "Vaccine-elicited memory CD4+ T cell expansion is impaired in the lungs during tuberculosis.", "journal": ["PLoS pathogens", "PLoS Pathog."]}
