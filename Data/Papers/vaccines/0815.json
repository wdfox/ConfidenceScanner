In this study, two layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanomaterial forms, i.e. nanoparticles (NPs) and nanosheets (NSs), were synthesised and examined as adjuvants to provoke the immune responses for anti-tumour purpose. Immunogen ovalbumin (OVA) delivered by both nanomaterials induced much stronger humoral and cell-medicated immune responses, together with an immune stimulant (TLR9 ligand CpG), as evidenced by higher levels of IgG1, IgG2a and interferon-\u03b3. By comparison, LDH NSs showed higher activity to promote specific antibody responses than LDH NPs but with a similar cell-mediated immune response. The mice immunised with OVA-CpG vaccines formulated with both nanomaterials showed stronger inhibition of the inoculated tumour growth and had a longer survival. Altogether, these data indicate that LDH NPs and NSs can be used as potential nanoadjuvants for efficient protein-based anti-tumour vaccines.", "doi": "10.1039/c7dt03725b", "title": "High adjuvant activity of layered double hydroxide nanoparticles and nanosheets in anti-tumour vaccine formulations.", "journal": ["Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)", "Dalton Trans"]}
