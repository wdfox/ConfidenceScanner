The presence of ovalbumin (this protein constitutes >60% total protein in the allantoic fluid) in the vaccine can lead to severe allergy. Hence, effective reduction of ovalbumin content is of crucial importance for vaccine production. We compared two methods of purification and concentration of influenza virus: zonal gradient ultracentrifugation and combined ultrafiltration/diafiltration and exclusion chromatography protocol, used for fabrication of seasonal vaccines. Combined chromatography is comparable with zonal centrifugation protocol by the results of ovalbumin removal (to meet standard requirements).", "doi": "10.1007/s10517-017-3964-y", "title": "Comparison of Different Methods of Purification and Concentration in Production of Influenza Vaccine.", "journal": ["Bulletin of experimental biology and medicine", "Bull.
