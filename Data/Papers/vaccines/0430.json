Recent reports have described the use of virtual reality (VR) as a method of distraction during such procedures. How does VR work in reducing pain and anxiety in pediatric patients and what are the potential uses for it? Answer Recent studies explored using VR with pediatric patients undergoing procedures ranging from vaccinations and intravenous injections to laceration repair and dressing changes for burn wounds. Interacting with immersive VR might divert attention, leading to a slower response to incoming pain signals. Preliminary results have shown that VR is effective, either alone or in combination with standard care, in reducing the pain and anxiety patients experience compared with standard care or other distraction methods.", "doi": null, "title": "Virtual reality for pain and anxiety management in children.", "journal": ["Canadian family physician Medecin de famille canadien", "Can Fam Physician"]}
