Despite significant advances, much needs to be learned. Recent studies in virology and immunology have improved our understanding of the role of the immune system in protection and in the pathogenesis of these infections and of co-evolution of viruses and their hosts. These findings, together with sophisticated molecular structure analyses, omics tools and computer-based models, have helped delineate the interaction between respiratory viruses and the host immune system, which will facilitate the development of novel treatment strategies and vaccines with enhanced efficacy.", "doi": "10.1016/j.coviro.2017.11.002", "title": "Immune responses in influenza A virus and human coronavirus infections: an ongoing battle between the virus and host.", "journal": ["Current opinion in virology", "Curr Opin Virol"]}
