Nano-11 are cationic dendrimer-like \u03b1-D-glucan nanoparticles with a diameter of 70-80\u2009nm. Mice injected with antigen formulated with Nano-11 developed antibody titers that were similar or greater than antigen with aluminum adjuvant. Utilizing an in vivo imaging system, Nano-11 was shown to remain at the injection site after administration and cleared gradually over the course of 3 weeks. Injection of Nano-11 induced a transient inflammatory response characterized by recruitment of a mixed population of inflammatory cells, predominantly monocytes and macrophages with relatively few neutrophils. Recruited Mac-2+macrophages efficiently phagocytized the majority of Nano-11 at the injection site. Fluorescently labeled Nano-11 was present in cells in the draining lymph nodes 1 day after injection, with the majority contained in migratory dendritic cells. Injection of ovalbumin adsorbed to Nano-11 resulted in an increase of ovalbumin-containing cells in draining lymph nodes. Nano-11 delivered more antigen to antigen-presenting cells on a per cell basis and demonstrated more specific targeting to highly immunopotentiating migratory dendritic cells compared with soluble or aluminum hydroxide adsorbed ovalbumin. These results support the efficacy of Nano-11 and its potential use as a next generation vaccine adjuvant.", "doi": "10.1038/s41541-017-0007-7", "title": "Alpha-D-glucan nanoparticulate adjuvant induces a transient inflammatory response at the injection site and targets antigen to migratory dendritic cells.", "journal": ["NPJ vaccines", "NPJ Vaccines"]}
