Based on an analysis of activity logs and staff interviews, specific activities and the time required to complete each were analyzed as follows: a) NCM\u00a0+\u00a0CM only; b) SE\u00a0+\u00a0CM only; c) time to administer/record vaccines; and d) time to receive and record CM visits. Cost comparison of the interventions included only staffing costs and direct cash expenditures.The study outcomes showed significant over time reductions in all measures of drug use and multiple sex partners, compared to baseline, although no significant between-group differences were detected. Cost analysis favored the simpler SE\u00a0+\u00a0CM intervention over the more labor-intensive NCM\u00a0+\u00a0CM approach. Because of the high levels of staffing required for the NCM relative to SE, costs associated with it were significantly higher.Findings suggest that while both intervention strategies were equally effective in achieving desired health outcomes, the brief SE\u00a0+\u00a0CM appeared less expensive to deliver.", "doi": "10.1016/j.puhe.2017.10.024", "title": "Cost-effective way to reduce stimulant-abuse among gay/bisexual men and transgender women: a randomized clinical trial with a cost comparison.", "journal": ["Public health", "Public Health"]}
