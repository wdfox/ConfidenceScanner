Aluminum (alum) compounds are the most commonly used adjuvants in human vaccinations for infection diseases. However, alum adjuvants are nondegradable, cause side effects due to the persistence of alum at injection sites, and are rather ineffective for cancer immunotherapy, which requires the Th1 immune response. Recently, we have shown that a plain mesoporous silica (MS) adjuvant can stimulate Th1 anticancer immunity for cancer vaccines. Herein, MS nanospheres doped with Ca, Mg, and Zn (MS-Ca, MS-Mg, and MS-Zn) showed significantly higher degradation rates than pure MS. Moreover, MS-Ca, MS-Mg, and MS-Zn nanospheres \u00a0stimulated anticancer immune response and increased the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations in spleen. The MS-Ca, MS-Mg, and MS-Zn nanospheres with improved biodegradability and excellent ability to induce Th1 anticancer immunity show potential for clinical applications as cancer immunoadjuvants.", "doi": "10.1021/acsami.7b16118", "title": "Biodegradable Metal Ion-Doped Mesoporous Silica Nanospheres Stimulate Anticancer Th1 Immune Response in Vivo.", "journal": ["ACS applied materials & interfaces", "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces"]}
