Current enzootic spread of highly pathogenic H5N1 virus among wild and domestic poultry and a number of severe human respiratory diseases caused by this pathogen have stimulated necessity of development of potentially pandemic influenza vaccines.In the past few years, significant research was conducted on how to prevent H5N1 influenza. Live, attenuated cold-adapted reassortant influenza vaccine (LAIV) is considered as one of the most promising candidates for pandemic and prepandemic vaccines. LAIV has proven to be safe and efficacious; pandemic LAIV might be more effective than inactivated vaccine in providing broader immune response.This review covers development of LAIVs against potential avian \"pandemic\" H5N1 subtype based on cold-adapted A/Leningrad/134/17/57 (H2N2) master donor virus backbone, and their preclinical and clinical studies.", "doi": "10.2174/1874285801711010316", "title": "Live Attenuated Reassortant Vaccines Based on A/Leningrad/134/17/57 Master Donor Virus Against H5 Avian Influenza.", "journal": ["The open microbiology journal", "Open Microbiol J"]}
