Frailty, the multi-dimensional syndrome marked by losses in function and physiological reserve, is increasingly prevalent with advancing age. Frailty accelerates this immunosenescence but the consequence of frailty on immune response specific to influenza vaccine among older adults, is mixed. An observational, prospective study of 114 adults was conducted in the fall of 2013 to assess the association of physical frailty with immune response to standard dose influenza vaccine in community-dwelling adults \u2265 50\u00a0years of age. Participants were stratified by age (<65\u00a0years and \u226565\u00a0years), and vaccine strain (Influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B) was analyzed separately adjusting for body mass index (BMI) and baseline log2 hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers. Overall, immune responses were lower among those \u226565\u00a0years of age than those <65\u00a0years. Among those \u226565\u00a0years there were no significant differences between frail and non-frail individuals in seroprotection or seroconversion for any influenza strain. Frail individuals <65\u00a0years of age compared with non-frail individuals were more likely to be seroprotected and to seroconvert post vaccination. Linear regression models show the same pattern of significant differences between frail and non-frail for those <65\u00a0years but no significant differences between frailty groups for those \u226565\u00a0years. Additional research may elucidate the reasons for the differences observed between younger frail and non-frail adults.", "doi": "10.1080/21645515.2017.1405883", "title": "The effect of frailty on HAI response to influenza vaccine among community-dwelling adults \u2265 50\u00a0years of age.", "journal": ["Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics", "Hum Vaccin Immunother"]}
