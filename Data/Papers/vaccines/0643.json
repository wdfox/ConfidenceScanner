Effective vaccines are currently being sought, but no vaccine is thus far available. In our previous study, recombinant AIK-C measles vaccine expressing the RSV fusion protein (MVAIK/RSV/F) was developed and protective immunity against RSV demonstrated in cotton rats. In the present study, the immunogenicity and protective effects were investigated in three cynomolgus monkeys immunized with MVAIK/RSV/F. Neutralizing test antibodies against RSV were detected and no infectious virus was recovered from the lungs of monkeys immunized with MVAIK/RSV/F after challenge. MVAIK/RSV/F has the potential to inhibit RSV infection.", "doi": "10.1111/1348-0421.12559", "title": "Immunogenicity of recombinant measles vaccine expressing fusion protein of respiratory syncytial virus in cynomolgus monkeys.", "journal": ["Microbiology and immunology", "Microbiol.
