Although a variety of cell patterning methods have been demonstrated, many of these methods subject cells to high stress environments, discriminate against certain phenotypes, or are a challenge to implement. Here, we demonstrate a rapid, simple, indiscriminate, and minimally perturbing cell patterning method using a laser fabricated polymer stencil. The stencil fabrication process requires no stencil-substrate alignment, and is readily adaptable to various substrate geometries and experiments.", "doi": "10.1186/s12896-017-0408-8", "title": "Laser-fabricated cell patterning stencil for single cell analysis.", "journal": ["BMC biotechnology", "BMC Biotechnol."]}
