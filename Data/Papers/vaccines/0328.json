These findings raise the exciting possibility that patients could be therapeutically treated with personalized vaccines against the mutations expressed by their own tumor. A central challenge for the broader clinical application of this approach will be to define the best antigens to target, to determine the subset of patients most likely to derive significant clinical benefit, and, finally, to discover both the best method of vaccine delivery and the optimal time in the disease course to do so. A growing number of translational immunologists believe that these challenges can be overcome and this perspective will discuss strategies to achieve this.", "doi": "10.1101/cshperspect.a028837", "title": "Is It Possible to Develop Cancer Vaccines to Neoantigens, What Are the Major Challenges, and How Can These Be Overcome?
