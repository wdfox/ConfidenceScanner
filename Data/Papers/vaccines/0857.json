These studies produced divergent results. The differences should be replicated and studied further. Included in such studies, patient ethnicities, states of stress, nutrition, and health, as well as the precise characteristics of the various cholera vaccines and modes of delivery need to be considered as well.", "doi": "10.6026/97320630013347", "title": "Cholera host response gene networks: preliminary studies.", "journal": ["Bioinformation", "Bioinformation"]}
