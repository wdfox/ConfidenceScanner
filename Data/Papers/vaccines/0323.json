In this commentary, I discuss the likelihood that CD8+ responses are also important in protection from intestinal Gram-negative bacteria, as well as the many factors that should be taken into consideration during the development of vaccines, based on eliciting long-term protection predominantly mediated by CD8+ responses against these organisms.", "doi": "10.1101/cshperspect.a029546", "title": "Is a Human CD8 T-Cell Vaccine Possible, and if So, What Would It Take?
