Effective vaccination strategies have successfully reduced the spread of measles, mumps, and rubella in the United States, but a current trend of increased vaccination hesitancy, fear of vaccine safety, and spread of misconceptions surrounding the science of vaccines have led to a relative resurgence of these diseases in the developed world. This article aims to explore why measles, mumps, and rubella should continue to be on the radar of medical professionals, and why the study of these diseases is important for understanding other teratogenic viruses of public health importance.", "doi": "10.1016/j.coviro.2017.11.009", "title": "Consequences of perinatal infections with rubella, measles, and mumps.", "journal": ["Current opinion in virology", "Curr Opin Virol"]}
