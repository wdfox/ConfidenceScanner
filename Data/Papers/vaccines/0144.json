Hemagglutinin\u00a0(HA) is an important viral protein of influenza A and is a major component of current IAV vaccines. The side effects associated with IAV vaccination are well studied; however, the HA\u2011induced immunopathological changes have remained largely elusive. The primary objective of the present study was to determine the tissue cross\u2011reactive epitopes of HA proteins. Monoclonal antibodies\u00a0(McAbs) were generated according to traditional methods using purified HA proteins from influenza vaccine lysates. The specificity of these McAbs was analyzed using western blot analysis and ELISA. Human tissue microarrays were employed for immunohistochemical staining to screen these McAbs. Rat brain tissues were subjected to immunohistochemical staining and electron microscopy to demonstrate the subcellular localization of antibodies targeting specific antigens. A total of 67\u00a0hybridoma cell lines positive for McAb against HA antigen were obtained. Three cross\u2011reactive McAbs (H1\u201113, H1\u201115 and A1\u201110) were discovered through tissue screening. Based on the 3\u00a0cross\u2011reactive McAbs and the amino acid sequence of HA, the presence of two broadly cross\u2011reactive HA epitopes, 194\u2011WGIHH\u2011198 and 365\u2011WYGYHH\u2011370, was assumed. McAbs against these synthetic epitope peptides were obtained. They reacted with porphyrin ring\u2011containing molecules, including hemoglobin\u00a0(Hb) and protoporphyrin, and with numerous types of normal tissue. In conclusion, the present study identified two broadly cross\u2011reactive epitopes on HA (194\u2011WGIHH\u2011198 and 365\u2011WYGYHH\u2011370). Antibodies against these epitopes react with Hb and numerous types of important normal tissues/organs. These newly identified cross\u2011reactive epitopes from IAV HA may provide crucial information for influenza research.", "doi": "10.3892/ijmm.2017.3344", "title": "Identification and characterization of epitopes from influenza A virus hemagglutinin that induce broadly cross-reactive antibodies.", "journal": ["International journal of molecular medicine", "Int.
