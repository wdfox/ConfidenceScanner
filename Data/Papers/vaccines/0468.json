Theoretically, these vaccines should protect against viruses expected to circulate in the next influenza season. The National Influenza Centers, based on surveillance data from National Reference Laboratories, selects the strains composing each annual trivalent or tetravalent vaccine. Nevertheless, in some epidemics, vaccine strains do not match genetically with circulating strains. The aim of the present study is to compare the HA1-domain of 42 influenza B viruses circulating in Cuba during the 2012-2013 season with the vaccine strain B/Wisconsin/01/2010-like virus from the B/Yamagata lineage, included in the 2012-2013 Northern-Hemisphere Influenza vaccine. The efficacy of the influenza vaccine was also estimated. The analysis of the present study indicates that the B/Victoria and B/Yamagata lineages co-circulated in Cuba in the 2012-2013 season. In 2012-2013 season, according to the sequences analysis, trivalent vaccine did not match with the circulating strains. The present study also detected amino acid substitutions which could have altered the antigenic properties of HA gene. The results presented here suggest the need to consider a possible introduction of tetravalent influenza vaccine in Cuba, as has been recommended by the WHO to ensure higher levels of protection.", "doi": "10.1016/j.meegid.2017.12.004", "title": "Vaccine-mismatched influenza B/Yamagata lineage viruses in Cuba, 2012-2013 season.", "journal": ["Infection, genetics and evolution : journal of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genetics in infectious diseases", "Infect.
