Response rate, disease control rate, progression-free and overall survival were monitored. Genotyping of CYP1A1*2C was performed in all patients.DT and DC produced similar overall disease control rates (76.9 vs 69.2%), median PFS (6.7 vs. 7.5 months) and OS (20.1 vs. 21.0 months) (P\u2009>\u20090.05 for all comparisons); however, DT exhibited a higher rate of control of localized liver metastases (78.6 vs 41.2%, P\u2009=\u20090.023). Among patients homozygous for wild-type CYP1A1*1 genotype (AA), DT treatment was associated with a significantly longer PFS (8.4 vs. 6.4 months, P\u2009=\u20090.019) and OS (33.4 vs. 15.8 months, P\u2009=\u20090.018). Conversely, among patients carrying the variant CYP1A1*2C genotype (AG/GG), DC treatment was associated with a significantly longer PFS (8.4 vs. 5.5 month, P\u2009=\u20090.005), and OS (28.5 vs. 19.6 months, P\u2009=\u20090.010). After adjusting for competing risk factors, CYP1A1*2C genotype was confirmed to be an independent predictor of PFS and OS for each chemotherapy combination.Overall, DT and DC result in similar clinical efficacy for MBC patients; however, efficacy for each therapy differs depending on CYP1A1*2C genotype.", "doi": "10.1007/s00280-017-3500-9", "title": "CYP1A1 genetic polymorphism is a promising predictor to improve chemotherapy effects in patients with metastatic breast cancer treated with docetaxel plus thiotepa vs. docetaxel plus capecitabine.", "journal": ["Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology", "Cancer Chemother.
