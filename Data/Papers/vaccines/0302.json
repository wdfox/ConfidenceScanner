Cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) are used as mucosal adjuvants to enhance the immunogenicity of intranasal influenza hemagglutinin (HA) vaccines. The adjuvant activity of 2'3' cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP) on Ig production was investigated in nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT), serum of wild-type C57BL/6J, and stimulator of interferon genes (STING)-deficient mice, which do not recognize cGAMP. Mice were vaccinated intranasally with a HA vaccine with or without the cGAMP adjuvant. IgA and IgG production, T-cell responses, germinal center formation, and cytokine expression in NALT were assayed. cGAMP enhanced IgA and IgG production, and promoted T-cell responses. Intranasal administration of cGAMP activated both NALT and systemic immune cells, induced a favorable cytokine environment for IgA induction, and promoted germinal center formation. The cGAMP effect was STING-dependent. Taken together, cGAMP as an HA vaccine adjuvant promoted a STING-dependent NALT environment suitable for the enhancement of IgA production.", "doi": "10.3390/medsci5040035", "title": "cGAMP Promotes Germinal Center Formation and Production of IgA in Nasal-Associated Lymphoid Tissue.", "journal": ["Medical sciences (Basel, Switzerland)", "Med Sci (Basel)"]}
