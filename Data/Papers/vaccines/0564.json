We calculated the unadjusted and INF-AF adjusted rates and relative risk (RR) due to HIV infection. Rates were expressed per 100 000 population.The estimated mean annual unadjusted rates of influenza-associated illness were 1467.7, 50.3 and 27.4 among patients with ILI, SARI-10 and SCRI-10, respectively. After adjusting for the INF-AF the percent reduction of the estimated rates was 8.9% (rate: 1336.9), 11.0% (rate: 44.8) and 16.3% (rate: 22.9) among patients with ILI, SARI-10 and SCRI-10, respectively. HIV-infected compared to HIV-uninfected individuals experienced a 2.3 (95% CI: 2.2-2.4), 9.7 (95% CI: 8.0-11.8) and 10.0 (95% CI: 7.9-12.7) fold increased risk of influenza-associated illness among patients with ILI, SARI-10 and SCRI-10, respectively. Overall 34% of the estimated influenza-associated hospitalizations had symptom duration of >10 days; 8% and 44% among individuals aged <5 and \u22655 years, respectively.The marginal differences between unadjusted and INF-AF adjusted rates are unlikely to affect policies on prioritization of interventions. HIV-infected individuals experienced an increased risk of influenza-associated illness and may benefit more from annual influenza immunization. The use of a symptom duration cut-off of \u226410 days may underestimate influenza-associated disease burden, especially in older individuals. This article is protected by copyright.
