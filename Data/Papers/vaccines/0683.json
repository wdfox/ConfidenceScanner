Taxonomically, it is a heterogenous group of vertebrate viruses found in several viral families. With only one exception, African swine fever virus, all TBVs have a RNA genome. To date, at least 160 tick-borne viruses are known, some of them pose a significant threat to human and animal health worldwide. Recently, a number of established TBVs has re-emerged and spread to new geographic locations due to the influence of anthropogenic activities and few available vaccines. Moreover, new emerging tick-borne diseases are constantly being reported. Major advances in molecular biotechnologies have led to discoveries of new TBVs and further genetic characterization of unclassified viruses resulting in changes in TBVs classification created by the International Committee for the Taxonomy of Viruses. Although TBVs spend over 95% of their life cycle within tick vectors and the role of ticks as vectors has been known for over 100 years, our knowledge about TBVs and molecular processes involved in the virus-tick interactions is scarce.", "doi": "10.4149/av_2017_403", "title": "Tick-borne viruses.", "journal": ["Acta virologica", "Acta Virol."]}
