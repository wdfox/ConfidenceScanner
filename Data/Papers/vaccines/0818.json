A variety of targeted agents are being tested in the clinic including cancer vaccines, immunotoxins, antibodies and T cell immunotherapy for GBM. We have previously reported that IL-13 receptor subunits \u03b11 and \u03b12 of IL-13R complex are overexpressed in GBM. We are investigating the significance of IL-13R\u03b11 and \u03b12 expression in GBM tumors. In order to elucidate a possible relationship between IL-13R\u03b11 and \u03b12 expression with severity and prognoses of subjects with GBM, we analyzed gene expression (by microarray) and clinical data available at the public The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database (Currently known as Global Data Commons). More than 40% of GBM samples were highly positive for IL-13R\u03b12 mRNA (Log2\u2009\u2265\u20092) while only less than 16% samples were highly positive for IL-13R\u03b11 mRNA. Subjects with high IL-13R\u03b11 and \u03b12 mRNA expressing tumors were associated with a significantly lower survival rate irrespective of their treatment compared to subjects with IL-13R\u03b11 and \u03b12 mRNA negative tumors. We further observed that IL-13R\u03b12 gene expression is associated with GBM resistance to temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy. The expression of IL-13R\u03b12 gene did not seem to correlate with the expression of genes for other chains involved in the formation of IL-13R complex (IL-13R\u03b11 or IL-4R\u03b1) in GBM. However, a positive correlation was observed between IL-4R\u03b1 and IL-13R\u03b11 gene expression. The microarray data of IL-13R\u03b12 gene expression was verified by RNA-Seq data. In depth analysis of TCGA data revealed that immunosuppressive genes (such as FMOD, CCL2, OSM, etc.) were highly expressed in IL-13R\u03b12 positive tumors, but not in IL-13R\u03b12 negative tumors. These results indicate a direct correlation between high level of IL-13R mRNA expression and poor patient prognosis and that immunosuppressive genes associated with IL-13R\u03b12 may play a role in tumor progression. These findings have important implications in understanding the role of IL-13R in the pathogenesis of GBM and potentially other cancers.", "doi": "10.1007/s11060-017-2680-9", "title": "Analysis of the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) database identifies an inverse relationship between interleukin-13 receptor \u03b11 and \u03b12 gene expression and poor prognosis and drug resistance in subjects with glioblastoma multiforme.", "journal": ["Journal of neuro-oncology", "J.
