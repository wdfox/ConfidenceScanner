Since it takes an extremely long time to accurately determine the protective efficacy of TB vaccines, there is a great need to identify the surrogate signatures of protection to facilitate vaccine development. Unfortunately, antigen-specific Th1 cytokines that are currently used to evaluate the protective efficacy of the TB vaccine, do not align with the protection and failure of TB vaccine candidates in clinical trials. In this review, we discuss the limitation of current Th1 cytokines as surrogates of protection and address the potential elements that should be considered to finalize the true functional signatures of protective immunity against TB.Cellular and Molecular Immunology advance online publication, 20 November 2017; doi:10.1038/cmi.2017.113.", "doi": "10.1038/cmi.2017.113", "title": "Th1 cytokines, true functional signatures for protective immunity against TB?", "journal": ["Cellular & molecular immunology", "Cell.
