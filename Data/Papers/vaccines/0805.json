Babies who were given bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin, oral polio vaccine were included. Mobile phone numbers of parents were noted. The 1st reminder call was given after 7 days if a baby did not report on the scheduled date. Similarly, 2nd and 3rd reminder calls were made after waiting for 7 days each time in case of non-reporting. Record of reporting and reminder calls was reviewed daily till all the enrolled babies crossed 15 months of age (scheduled time for 2nd dose of measles) plus 4 weeks.A total of 150 babies were enrolled at the time of 1st vaccination. Reporting without call within 01 week of scheduled date ranged from 52(34.66%) to 99(66%) for different vaccines. The 1st reminder call showed maximum improvement in reporting rate. The range of vaccination rate reached from 91(60.66%) to 132(88%). The 2nd call improved coverage rate range from 108(71.99%) to 140(93.33%). The 3rd call improved coverage rate from 113(75.32%) to 144(96%). Overall coverage rate achieved ranged from 112.5(75%) to 144(96%).Patient reminder calls showed significant effect in improvement of vaccination coverage rate of all antigens.", "doi": null, "title": "An effective and doable interventional strategy to enhance vaccination coverage - are we ready to change?", "journal": ["JPMA.
