Promiscuous Toxoplasma is transmitted by contaminated food and animal produce, water, vegetations, fruits and sexually through semen. Toxoplasma infects nucleated cells with a unique tropism for muscles and central nervous system and a mind bugging malicious effect. Pregnant women with acute or reactivated toxoplasmosis can transmit Toxoplasma via transplacental to the fetus. The severity of congenital toxoplasmosis depends on the gestation period, as infection in early pregnancy causes more severe consequences. Congenital toxoplasmosis complications include miscarriage, encephalitis, neurological retardation, mental illnesses, auditory and visual inflammatory disorders, cardiovascular abnormalities, and pains. Current therapies are inefficient for congenital and chronic toxoplasmosis or have severe side effects with life threatening complications. There is an urgent need for effective and safe therapeutic modalities to treat complications of toxoplasmosis and effective vaccines to eliminate the infectious agent. This investigation will discuss pathogenesis of feto-maternal, congenital and pediatric toxoplasmosis, the current available therapies in practice, and explore those therapeutic modalities in experimental stages for promising future trials.", "doi": "10.1055/s-0037-1603942", "title": "Fetomaternal and Pediatric Toxoplasmosis.", "journal": ["Journal of pediatric infectious diseases", "J Pediatr Infect Dis"]}
