Lessons learned during 2015/16 ESS implementation were integrated and applied towards the current ESS. The primary objective was to estimate the reporting rates of suspected adverse reactions (ARs) occurring within 7\u00a0days of vaccination with Vaxigrip or Intanza 15\u00a0\u00b5g. For Vaxigrip (N = 962), 17 vaccinees (1.8%) reported 59 suspected ARs (6.1%) within 7\u00a0days of vaccination. For Intanza 15\u00a0\u00b5g (N = 1000), 21 vaccinees (2.1%) reported 101 (10.1%) suspected ARs within 7\u00a0days of vaccination. No obvious pattern in the type of suspected ARs or their frequency was observed for either vaccine. None of the frequencies of suspected ARs were above the 2015/16 ESS frequencies for Vaxigrip, whereas for Intanza 15\u00a0\u00b5g only one AR (oropharyngeal pain) crossed the historical threshold. There was no change in reactogenicity and data was consistent with the safety profiles of the two vaccines. The passive ESS experience gained from season to season will help to contribute to a sustainable safety surveillance system of seasonal influenza vaccines early in the season.", "doi": "10.1080/21645515.2017.1405882", "title": "Report from enhanced safety surveillance of two influenza vaccines (Vaxigrip and Intanza 15\u00a0\u03bcg) in two European countries during influenza season 2016/17 and comparison with 2015/16 season.", "journal": ["Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics", "Hum Vaccin Immunother"]}
