It resulted in the core structure that differed significantly from the one proposed previously. Overall architecture of PJ1 LPS was found to be consistent with a structural model described for several other H.\u00a0pylori strains. It contained a polymer of d-glycero-d-manno-heptose (dd-Hep) as the O-chain component, linked to \u03b1-1,6-glucan through a dd-Hep oligosaccharide. H.\u00a0pylori PJ1 HP1283:cam LPS was missing dd-heptan, terminating with an \u03b1-1,6-glucan chain containing 5-13 glucose residues. LPS of strain PJ1 HP1284:cam was missing dd-Hep from the core and had \u03b2-GlcNAc attached directly to O-3 of the inner-core ld-Hep residue. To investigate the role of dd-heptan in protective immunity, delipidated LPS (dLPS) from strain PJ1 was conjugated to tetanus toxoid (TT) and immunological properties of the resultant glycoconjugate dLPS(PJ1)-TT determined. The dLPS(PJ1)-TT conjugate was immunogenic in mice and rabbits and induced specific and cross-reactive functional antibodies against homologous and heterologous strains of H.\u00a0pylori. Whole cell indirect ELISA performed on a selected number of H.\u00a0pylori isolates confirmed that the immune response correlated with the presence of \u03b1-1,6-glucan and was not augmented by the dd-Hep content of these strains.", "doi": "10.1016/j.carres.2017.10.024", "title": "Structural and immunological characterization of a glycoconjugate based on the delipidated lipopolysaccharide from a nontypeable Helicobacter pylori strain PJ1 containing an extended d-glycero-d-manno-heptan.", "journal": ["Carbohydrate research", "Carbohydr.
