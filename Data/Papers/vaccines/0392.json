We used univariate and multivariate analysis to compare responses of respondents with CD and NCGS.The overall response rate was 27% (NCGS n\u00a0=\u00a0217, CD n\u00a0=\u00a01291). Subjects with NCGS were more likely than those with CD to disagree with the statement that \"vaccines are safe for people with celiac disease\" (NCGS 41.3% vs. CD 26.4% (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), and were more likely to decline vaccination when offered (30.9 vs. 24.2%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.007). After adjusting for age and gender, NCGS subjects were more likely than CD subjects to avoid genetically modified (GMO) foods (aOR 2.30; 95% CI 1.71-3.10), eat only organic products (aOR 2.87; 95% CI 2.04-4.03), believe that the FDA is an unreliable source of information (aOR 1.82, 95% CI 1.26-2.64), and believe a GF diet improves energy and concentration (aOR 2.52; 95% CI 1.86-3.43).Subjects with NCGS were more likely than those with CD to have doubts about vaccine safety and believe in the value of non-GMO and organic foods. Our findings suggest that the lack of reliable information on gluten and its content in food and medications may reinforce beliefs that result in a detriment to public health.", "doi": "10.1007/s10620-017-4879-1", "title": "Skepticism Regarding Vaccine and Gluten-Free Food Safety Among Patients with Celiac Disease and Non-celiac Gluten Sensitivity.", "journal": ["Digestive diseases and sciences", "Dig.
