Certain antibiotics elicit a delayed death phenotype by targeting this organelle. Here, we review apicoplast targeting drugs and their targets, particularly those that cause delayed death, and highlight its potential uses in malaria vaccine development.", "doi": "10.1016/j.micinf.2017.12.005", "title": "Exploiting the apicoplast: apicoplast-targeting drugs and malaria vaccine development.", "journal": ["Microbes and infection", "Microbes Infect."]}
