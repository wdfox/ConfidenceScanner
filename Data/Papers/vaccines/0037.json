Vaccines offer an exciting strategy for the treatment of cocaine addiction; however, vaccine formulations need to be optimized to improve efficacy. Herein, we examine the effectiveness of a tricomponent cocaine vaccine, defined as having its hapten (GNE) and adjuvant (cytosine-guanine oligodeoxynucleotide 1826, CpG ODN 1826) covalently linked via the immunogenic protein ovalbumin (OVA). The tricomponent vaccine (GNE-OVA-CpG 1826) and a vaccine of analogous, individual components (GNE-OVA+CpG ODN 1826) were found to similarly induce highly specific anticocaine antibody production in mice and block cocaine's stimulant effects in hyperlocomotor testing.", "doi": "10.1016/j.bmcl.2017.12.043", "title": "Investigations into the efficacy of multi-component cocaine vaccines.", "journal": ["Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters", "Bioorg.
