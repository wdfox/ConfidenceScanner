Emerging H3N2 variants require the annual adjustment of the vaccine strain. Recently, studies addressing the reduced effectiveness of current H3N2 vaccines have identified production-related substitutions in the viral hemagglutinin antigen as a possible cause for reduced vaccine efficacy.", "doi": "10.1016/j.tim.2017.12.003", "title": "Influenza H3N2 Vaccines: Recent Challenges.", "journal": ["Trends in microbiology", "Trends Microbiol."]}
