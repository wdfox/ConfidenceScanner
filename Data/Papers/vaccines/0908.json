A facultative intracellular bacterium like F.n.n. exert an immunologic challenge against which live attenuated vaccines in general are most effective. Thus, we constructed a deletion in the F.n.n. clpB gene as \u0394clpB mutants are among the most promising vaccine candidates in human pathogenic Francisella.Characterization of F.n.n. \u0394clpB using primary Atlantic cod head kidney leukocytes, the zebrafish embryo and adult zebrafish model with focus on potential attenuation, relevant immune responses and immunogenic potential.Interleukin 1 beta transcription in Atlantic cod leukocytes was significantly elevated from 24 to 96\u202fh post infection with F.n.n. \u0394clpB compared to F.n.n. wild-type (wt). Growth attenuation of the deletion mutant in zebrafish embryos was observed by fluorescence microscopy and confirmed by genome quantification by qPCR. In the immunization experiment, adult zebrafish were immunized with 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f106\u202fCFU of F.n.n. \u0394clpB before challenge four weeks later with 6\u202f\u00d7\u202f108\u202fCFU of F.n.n. wt. One day after challenge, immunized zebrafish responded with significantly lower interleukin 8 levels compared to the non-immunized control. Immunized fish were protected against the acute mortality observed in non-immunized zebrafish after challenge and bacterial genomes quantified by qPCR were reduced to a minimum 28\u202fdays post challenge, indicating protective immunity stimulated by F.n.n. \u0394clpB.Deletion mutation of clpB in F.n.n. causes in vitro and in vivo attenuation and elicits a protective immune response in adult zebrafish against a lethal dose of F.n.n. wt. Taken together, the results presented increases the knowledge on protective immune responses against F.n.n.", "doi": "10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.11.009", "title": "Francisella noatunensis subspecies noatunensis clpB deletion mutant impairs development of francisellosis in a zebrafish model.", "journal": ["Vaccine", "Vaccine"]}
