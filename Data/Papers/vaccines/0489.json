The Plasmodium falciparum Apical Membrane Antigen 1 (AMA1) poses such a challenge. We found that immunization with a mixture of three variants yielded functional antibody levels to all variants comparable to levels induced by monovalent immunization. The mechanism behind the observed broadening was shown to be an increase in the fraction of cross-reactive antibodies, most likely because strain-specific epitopes are present at lower frequency relative to conserved epitopes. Areas covered: We hereby introduce the Epitope Dilution Phenomenon (EDiP) as a practical strategy for the induction of broad, cross-variant antibody responses against polymorphic antigens and discuss the utility and applicability of this phenomenon for the development of vaccines against polymorphic antigens of pathogens like Influenza, HIV, Dengue and Plasmodium. Expert commentary: EDiP can be used to broaden antibody responses by immunizing with a mixture of at least 3 antigenic variants, where the variants included can differ, yet yield broadened responses.", "doi": "10.1080/14760584.2018.1411198", "title": "EDiP: the Epitope Dilution Phenomenon.
