Only 10 out of 47 countries in Africa, and none from East Africa; have implemented the WHO recommendation of introducing a birth-dose of hepatitis B vaccine in their EPI program. This article therefore examines the challenges as well as the opportunities that exists for the introduction of a birth-dose of hepatitis vaccine in the National Expanded Program for Immunization (EPI) program by countries in the East African Region. It explores probable health systems factors that have hindered the countries from introducing the birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine and proposes actions that countries can take to introduce the vaccine based on their context by drawing on the experience of some Asian countries.", "doi": "10.11604/pamj.supp.2017.27.3.11544", "title": "Delayed introduction of the birth dose of Hepatitis B vaccine in EPI programs in East Africa: a missed opportunity for combating vertical transmission of Hepatitis B.", "journal": ["The Pan African medical journal", "Pan Afr Med J"]}
