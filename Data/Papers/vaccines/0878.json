Eligible patients were aged 18-55 years, diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), and either treated for \u22656 months with an approved dose of DMF or for \u22653 months with an approved dose of nonpegylated IFN. Primary end point was the proportion of patients with \u22652-fold rise in antitetanus serum IgG levels from prevaccination to 4 weeks after vaccination.Seventy-one patients (DMF treated, 38; IFN treated, 33) were enrolled. The mean age was 45.3 years (range 27-55); 86% were women. Responder rates (\u22652-fold rise) to Td vaccination were comparable between DMF- and IFN-treated groups (68% vs 73%). Responder rates (\u22652-fold rise) were also similar between DMF- and IFN-treated groups for diphtheria antitoxoid (58% vs 61%), pneumococcal serotype 3 (66% vs 79%), pneumococcal serotype 8 (95% vs 88%), and meningococcal serogroup C (53% vs 53%), all p > 0.05. In a post hoc analysis, no meaningful differences were observed between groups in the proportion of responders when stratified by age category or lymphocyte count.DMF-treated patients mount an immune response to recall, neoantigens, and T-cell-independent antigens, which was comparable with that of IFN-treated patients and provided adequate seroprotection.NCT02097849.This study provides Class II evidence that patients with RRMS treated with DMF respond to vaccinations comparably with IFN-treated patients.", "doi": "10.1212/NXI.0000000000000409", "title": "Immune response to vaccines is maintained in patients treated with dimethyl fumarate.", "journal": ["Neurology(R) neuroimmunology & neuroinflammation", "Neurol Neuroimmunol Neuroinflamm"]}
