In this light, we have identified in glypican-3 an HLA-24, HLA-A2 restriction peptide with extreme cancer specificity. In this paper, we summarize results from a number of related clinical trials demonstrating that glypican-3 peptide vaccines induce specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in most patients (UMIN Clinical Trials Registry: UMIN000001395, UMIN000005093, UMIN000002614, UMN000003696, UMIN000006357,). We also describe the current state of personalized cancer immunotherapy based on neoantigens, and assess, based on our own research and experience, the potential of such therapy to elicit cancer regression. Finally, we discuss the future direction of cancer immunotherapy. This article is protected by copyright.
