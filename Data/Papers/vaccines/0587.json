At present, tumor vaccines in clinical research typically are aimed at stimulating the cellular immune response, while more effective vaccines should take into account the synergy between broad spectrum antibodies and high levels of cellular immunity. In this study, epitope peptides (68-81, 95-104, 80-88) of the tumor antigen survivin were chosen as immunogens and supplemented with poly(I:C) and/or MF59 adjuvant to evaluate the immune effects and anti-melanoma activities. The results indicated that poly(I:C) and MF59 could assist the survivin epitope peptide immunogen to control the tumor size, quality, and volume in black melanoma mouse models. Analyses by antibody titering, antibody isotyping and ELISPOT suggested that the adjuvanted immunogen could induce humoral immunity in mice. Poly(I:C) and MF59 combined with survivin peptide 95-104 could effectively induce humoral immunity mediated by type 2 T helper (Th2) cells. This study provides a basis for candidate immunogen design based on survivin and provides support for tumor therapy that can induce a more balanced Th1/Th2 immune response.", "doi": "10.1002/jcp.26317", "title": "Effects of poly(I:C) and MF59 co-adjuvants on immunogenicity and efficacy of survivin polypeptide immunogen against melanoma.", "journal": ["Journal of cellular physiology", "J.
