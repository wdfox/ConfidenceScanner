The recent devastating outbreak of Zika virus in Brazil was preceded by the slow global encroachment of this virus over many decades. To date, significant research efforts are underway to understand the spread and the unique pathogenesis of this virus; with the intent to rapidly develop vaccines and therapeutics. Several model systems have emerged to study Zika. This review will focus on the use of nonhuman primates to model Zika infection.", "doi": "10.1093/infdis/jix540", "title": "Nonhuman Primate Models of Zika Virus Infection, Immunity, and Therapeutic Development.", "journal": ["The Journal of infectious diseases", "J.
