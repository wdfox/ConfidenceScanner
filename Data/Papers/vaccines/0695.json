We aimed to determine the association between serum antibody levels against 11 GBS surface proteins and recto-vaginal acquisition of GBS colonisation during pregnancy. Sera collected from pregnant women at 20-25 weeks and \u226537 weeks of gestation age were measured for IgG titres against GBS surface proteins using\u00a0 a multiplex immunoassay. Women were evaluated for recto-vaginal colonisation every 4-5 weeks. We observed that the likelihood of becoming colonised with GBS during pregnancy was lower in women with IgG titres \u2265200\u2009U/mL against gbs0233 (adjusted OR\u2009=\u20090.47 [95% CI: 0.25-0.89], p\u2009=\u20090.021) and \u226585\u2009U/mL for gbs1539 (adjusted OR\u2009=\u20090.44 [95% CI: 0.24-0.82], p\u2009=\u20090.01) when comparing between women who acquired GBS colonisation and those that remained free of GBS colonisation throughout pregnancy. IgG titres (U/mL) specific to BibA and Sip were higher in pregnant women colonised with GBS (380.19 and 223.87, respectively) compared to women with negative GBS cultures (234.42 and 186.21, respectively; p\u2009<\u20090.01) at \u226537 weeks gestation. Antibodies induced by gbs0233 and gbs1539 were associated with a reduced likelihood of recto-vaginal GBS acquisition during pregnancy and warrant further investigation as vaccine targets.", "doi": "10.1038/s41598-017-16757-9", "title": "Association between antibodies against group B Streptococcus surface proteins and recto-vaginal colonisation during pregnancy.", "journal": ["Scientific reports", "Sci Rep"]}
