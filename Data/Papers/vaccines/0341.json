Follow-on participants (N\u00a0=\u00a0646) were randomised 2:1 to vaccination and non-vaccination subsets; vaccination subsets received an additional 4CMenB dose. Newly enrolled vaccine-na\u00efve participants (N\u00a0=\u00a0205) received 2 catch-up doses, 1 month apart (accelerated schedule). Antibody levels were determined using human serum bactericidal assay (hSBA) against MenB indicator strains for fHbp, NadA, PorA and NHBA. Safety was also evaluated.Antibody levels declined across follow-on groups at 24-36 months versus 1 month post-vaccination. Antibody persistence and booster responses were similar between infants receiving the reduced or licensed 4CMenB-schedule. An additional dose in follow-on participants induced higher hSBA titres than a first dose in vaccine-na\u00efve children. Two catch-up doses in vaccine-na\u00efve participants induced robust antibody responses. No safety concerns were identified.Antibody persistence, booster responses, and safety profiles were similar with either 2\u00a0+\u00a01 or 3\u00a0+\u00a01 vaccination schedules.
