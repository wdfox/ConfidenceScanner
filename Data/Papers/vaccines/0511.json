Here we present evidence in support of cytobrush sampling of oral, rectal, and genital mucosal tissues as a minimally invasive approach for the phenotypic analyses of different T cells subsets de novo as well as prospectively after intranasal immunization in rhesus macaques. Significant percentages of viable lymphocytes were obtained consistently from both na\u00efve and chronically SIV-infected rhesus macaques. The percentages of CD3+ T cells in the blood were significantly higher compared to those in the mucosal tissues analyzed in the na\u00efve animals, while in the SIV+ animals the CD3+ T cells were significantly elevated in the rectal tissues, relative to all other sites analyzed. In the na\u00efve, but not SIV+ macaques, the rectal and vaginal mucosal tissues, compared to oral mucosa and blood, showed higher diversity and percentages of CD4+ T cells expressing the HIV entry co-receptor CCR5 and mucosal specific adhesion (CD103) as well as activation (HLA-DR) and proliferation (Ki67) markers. Sequential daily cytobrush sampling from the oral, rectal, and genital mucosal tissues was performed in SIV+ animals from an ongoing study where they were administered intranasal immunization with adenoviral vectored vaccines incorporating the green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene. We detected a transient increase in GFP+ CD4 T cells in only oral mucosa suggesting limited mucosal trafficking. In general, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells expressing Ki67 transiently increased in all mucosal tissues, but those expressing the CCR5, HLA-DR, and CD103 markers exhibited minor changes. We propose the minimally invasive cytobrush sampling as a practical approach for effective and prospective immune monitoring of the oral-genital mucosal tissues in NHP.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0188807", "title": "Minimally invasive monitoring of CD4 T cells at multiple mucosal tissues after intranasal vaccination in rhesus macaques.", "journal": ["PloS one", "PLoS ONE"]}
