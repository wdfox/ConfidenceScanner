Immunogenicity was assessed on Days 1, 28, 56, 208 and 393. Solicited local and systemic reactions were recorded for 7 days, unsolicited adverse events until Day 56, and serious adverse events (SAE) throughout the trial.All NoV formulations induced similar increases in Pan-Ig, IgA and histo-blood group binding antigen-blocking (HBGA) antibodies by Day 56, mostly after 1 dose, that persisted above baseline to Day 393. Higher GI.1 content interfered with GII.4c responses, and responses did not benefit from MPL. Overall reactogenicity consisted of mainly mild injection site pain, headache and fatigue. No vaccine-related SAEs were reported.All candidate NoV formulations were well tolerated. Overall, 15\u03bcg GI.1/50\u03bcg GII.4c elicited the best balance of immunogenicity with no clear benefit of MPL, and is the candidate formulation being taken forward in clinical development.", "doi": "10.1093/infdis/jix572", "title": "Safety and immunogenicity of different formulations of norovirus vaccine candidate in healthy adults: a randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial.", "journal": ["The Journal of infectious diseases", "J.
