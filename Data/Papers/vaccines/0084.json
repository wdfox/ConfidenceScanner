Hospitalization due to vaccine preventable diseases has been drastically reduced due to introduction of new effective vaccines. However, optimizing the benefits of immunization by achieving high universal coverage has met with many challenges. The Regional immunization coverage, though raised from its low 57% in 2000 to 76% in 2015 has remained below expected target. Worse still, it has stagnated around 70% for a prolonged period. Cases of inequity in access to immunization service continue to exist in the region. This paper therefore explored the different challenges to immunization in the African Region. Some of the challenges it identifies and discusses include issues of sustainable funding and resources for immunization, vaccine stock-outs, and logistics. Others include data issues and laboratory infrastructure. The paper also attempted some possible solutions.", "doi": "10.11604/pamj.supp.2017.27.3.12127", "title": "Challenges of immunization in the African Region.", "journal": ["The Pan African medical journal", "Pan Afr Med J"]}
