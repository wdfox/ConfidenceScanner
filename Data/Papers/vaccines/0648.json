Understanding factors that influence adult vaccination and coverage variability beyond the national level are important steps toward developing targeted strategies for increasing vaccination coverage. A retrospective analysis was conducted using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (2011-2014). Multivariable logistic regression modeling was employed to identify individual factors associated with vaccination (socio-demographics, health status, healthcare utilization, state of residence) and generate adjusted vaccination coverage and compliance estimates nationally and by state. Results indicated that multiple characteristics were consistently associated with a higher likelihood of vaccination across all four vaccines, including female sex, increased educational attainment, and annual household income. Model-adjusted vaccination coverage estimates varied widely by state, with inter-state variability for the most recent year of data as follows: influenza (aged \u226518 years) 30.2-49.5%; pneumococcal (aged \u226565 years) 64.0-74.7%; Tdap (aged \u226518 years) 18.7-46.6%; and HZ (aged \u226560 years) 21.3-42.9%. Model-adjusted compliance with age-appropriate recommendations across vaccines was low and also varied by state: influenza+Tdap (aged 18-59\u00a0years) 7.9-24.7%; influenza+Tdap+HZ (aged 60-64\u00a0years) 4.1-14.4%; and influenza+Tdap+HZ+pneumococcal (aged \u226565 years) 3.0-18.3%. In summary, after adjusting for individual characteristics associated with vaccination, substantial heterogeneity across states remained, suggesting that other local factors (e.g. state policies) may be impacting adult vaccines uptake. Further research is needed to understand such factors, focusing on differences between states with high versus low vaccination coverage.", "doi": "10.1080/21645515.2017.1403697", "title": "An analysis of factors associated with influenza, pneumoccocal, Tdap, and herpes zoster vaccine uptake in the US adult population and corresponding inter-state variability.", "journal": ["Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics", "Hum Vaccin Immunother"]}
