Towards the elimination of HA in the country, we assessed the duration and characteristics of immunity conferred by the widely used, locally manufactured HAV vaccine.This is a longitudinal cohort study that followed recipients of a live attenuated HAV vaccine 17\u202fyears after the initial administration. Blood samples were collected from participants pre- and two-week post-booster HAV vaccine dose. Serum anti-HAV antibody was measured by ELISA method. Memory B and T cells were determined by ELISPOT and Flow Cytometry assays, respectively.A robust anamnestic response was observed two-week post-challenge. Both HAV-specific memory B cell and T cells remained, and responded quickly when re-encountering HAV. The magnitude of recall responses was present, regardless of the status of the serum anti-HAV antibody pre-booster.We demonstrated long-term immunity from the live attenuated HAV vaccine, including antibody persistence and immunological memory. Considering the conditions that make elimination of infectious diseases feasible, following polio, hepatitis A could be targeted for elimination in China.", "doi": "10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.11.036", "title": "Immune memory at 17-years of follow-up of a single dose of live attenuated hepatitis A vaccine.", "journal": ["Vaccine", "Vaccine"]}
