We have developed a computational model and web-based decision support software for comparing cost-benefit tradeoffs from alternative PCV program designs, considering their direct and indirect effects on early childhood populations in resource-poor settings. This supports policy-makers in estimating potential health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of different vaccination program strategies for a wide range of population coverage and vaccine effectiveness assumptions.", "doi": null, "title": "Decision-Tree Model for Support of Health Policy Choices Based on Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV) Program Outcomes.", "journal": ["Studies in health technology and informatics", "Stud Health Technol Inform"]}
