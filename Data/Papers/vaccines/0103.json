Anaphylactic reaction to vaccinations is rare and is estimated to occur at a rate of 1 per million doses. Allergic reaction to vaccinations can be induced by the microbial antigens, toxoids, and also by residual proteins which are derived from cultures media and stabilizers, such as ovalbumine, gelatin and yeasts. Other adverse events include large local reactions at the injection site, delayed rashes or hypotonic-hyporesponsive episodes. Parents of children who have experienced adverse reactions to vaccines, might unnecessarily be advised to avoid subsequent vaccinations. Therefore, it is important to evaluate these children in order to decide on the nature of the adverse event, whether there is a contraindication to subsequent vaccinations, and to assess the risk for future allergic reactions. If needed, skin tests with the relevant vaccines and administration of vaccines in graded doses under supervision and preparation for treatment of the anaphylactic reaction in the Allergy clinic, can ensure the effective completion of childhood immunizations. In this article, we will review the data on allergic reactions to childhood vaccinations, and the protocols suggested for the evaluation and management of children with food allergies and children who have experienced allergic reactions to vaccinations.", "doi": null, "title": "[ALLERGIC REACTIONS TO CHILDHOOD VACCINATIONS].", "journal": ["Harefuah", "Harefuah"]}
