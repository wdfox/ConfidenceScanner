Governments of LMICs need enough convincing evidence that HPV vaccination will be more cost-effective in reducing the scourge of cervical cancer. Area covered: A systematic review to identify suitable studies from MEDLINE(via PubMed), EMBASE and Electronic search through GOOGLE for original and review articles from 2007 to 2014 on cost-effectiveness of human papilloma virus vaccination of pre-adolescent girls in LMICs was conducted. A total of 19 full articles were finally selected and reviewed after screening out those not consistent with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Expert commentary: Most studies on cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccine in LMICs show that lowering cost of HPV vaccination with or without Pap smear screening is cost-effective in areas with high incidence of cervical cancer.", "doi": "10.1080/14760584.2018.1411195", "title": "Cost effectiveness of human papilloma virus vaccination in low and middle income countries: a systematic review of literature.", "journal": ["Expert review of vaccines", "Expert Rev Vaccines"]}
