Subunit vaccines have advanced into the clinic without success. None were tested preclinically in male mice. We compared a single-cycle candidate vaccine deleted in HSV-2 glycoprotein D (\u0394gD-2) and subunit gD-2 or gD-1 protein vaccines in a male murine skin model. \u0394gD-2 provided complete protection against 10-times the lethal dose of HSV-1 or HSV-2 clinical isolates and no latent virus was detected, whereas gD-1 and gD-2 adjuvanted proteins provided little or no protection. Protection correlated with Fc receptor activating but not neutralizing antibody titers.", "doi": "10.1093/infdis/jix628", "title": "An HSV-2 single-cycle candidate vaccine deleted in glycoprotein D, \u0394gD-2, protects male mice from lethal skin challenge with clinical isolates of HSV-1 and HSV-2.", "journal": ["The Journal of infectious diseases", "J.
