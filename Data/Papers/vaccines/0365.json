It is therefore important to assess any new immune-based therapies in the context of immune checkpoint blockade. Here, we evaluate the impact of combining a synthetic consensus TERT DNA vaccine that has improved capacity to break tolerance with immune checkpoint inhibitors. We observed that blockade of CTLA-4 or, to a lesser extent, PD-1 synergized with TERT vaccine, generating more robust anti-tumor activity compared to checkpoint alone or vaccine alone. Despite this anti-tumor synergy, none of these immune checkpoint therapies showed improvement in TERT antigen-specific immune responses in tumor-bearing mice. \u03b1CTLA-4 therapy enhanced the frequency of T-bet+/CD44+ effector CD8+ T\u00a0cells within the tumor and decreased the frequency of regulatory T\u00a0cells within the tumor, but not in peripheral blood. CTLA-4 blockade synergized more than Treg depletion with TERT DNA vaccine, suggesting that the effect of CTLA-4 blockade is more likely due to the expansion of effector T cells in the tumor rather than a reduction in the frequency of Tregs. These results suggest that immune checkpoint inhibitors function to alter the immune regulatory environment to synergize with DNA vaccines, rather than boosting antigen-specific responses at the site of vaccination.", "doi": "10.1016/j.ymthe.2017.11.010", "title": "Synergy of Immune Checkpoint Blockade with a Novel Synthetic Consensus DNA Vaccine Targeting TERT.", "journal": ["Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy", "Mol.
