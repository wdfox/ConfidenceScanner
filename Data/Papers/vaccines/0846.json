One of the most studied is probably xenophagy, the selective capture and degradation of intracellular bacteria by lysosomes. However, the impact of autophagy goes beyond xenophagy and involves intensive cross-talks with other host defense mechanisms. In addition, autophagy machinery can have non-canonical functions such as LC3-associated phagocytosis. In this review, we intend to summarize the current knowledge on the many functions of autophagy proteins in cell defenses with a focus on bacteria-macrophage interaction. We also present the strategies developed by pathogens to evade or to exploit this machinery in order to establish a successful infection. Finally, we discuss the opportunities and challenges of autophagy manipulation in improving therapeutics and vaccines against bacterial pathogens.", "doi": "10.3389/fimmu.2017.01483", "title": "Macrophage Autophagy and Bacterial Infections.", "journal": ["Frontiers in immunology", "Front Immunol"]}
