Currently approved alum-adjuvanted vaccines require three doses and have reduced immunogenicity in adults, particularly in those who have diabetes mellitus, or are older, male, obese, or who smoke.Phase 3 observer-blinded, randomized (2:1 HBsAg-1018 [HEPLISAV-B\u2122]:HBsAg-Eng [Engerix-B\u00ae]), active-controlled trial in adults 18-70\u202fyears of age. HBsAg-1018 was administered intramuscularly at weeks 0 and 4 and placebo at week 24 and HBsAg-Eng at weeks 0, 4, and 24. The primary immunogenicity endpoint assessed the noninferiority of the seroprotection rate at week 28 in participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Secondary endpoints included seroprotection rates in the total trial population and by age, sex, body mass index, and smoking status.Among 8374 participants randomized, 961 participants in the per-protocol population had type 2 diabetes mellitus. In diabetes participants, the seroprotection rate in the HBsAg-1018 group at week 28 was 90.0%, compared with 65.1% in the HBsAg-Eng group, with a difference of 24.9% (95% CI: 19.3%, 30.7%), which met the prospectively-defined criteria for noninferiority and statistical significance. In the total study per-protocol population (N\u202f=\u202f6826) and each pre-specified subpopulation, the seroprotection rate in the HBsAg-1018 group was statistically significantly higher than in the HBsAg-Eng group.Two doses of HBsAg-1018, administered over 4\u202fweeks, induced significantly higher seroprotection rates than three doses of HBsAg-Eng, given over 24\u202fweeks, in adults with factors known to reduce the immune response to hepatitis B vaccines as well as in those without those factors. With fewer doses in a shorter time, and greater immunogenicity, HBsAg-1018 has the potential to significantly improve protection against hepatitis B in adults at risk for hepatitis B infection.
