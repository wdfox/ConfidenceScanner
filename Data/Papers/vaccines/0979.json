A toxoid vaccine was previously used for prevention of botulinum intoxication; however, this vaccine is no longer available. Currently, no approved botulinum vaccines are available from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Recently, a recombinant host cell receptor-binding subunit created for use as a potential vaccine completed phase 2 clinical trials. The current study designed a vaccine candidate against BoNT type A (BoNT/A) using a structural design. Our vaccine candidate was the BoNT/A heavy chain C-terminal region (HCR) that contained the point mutation BA15 (R1269A) within the ganglioside-binding site. A Biacore affinity test showed that the affinity of BA15 for ganglioside GT1b was 100\u00a0times lower than that of the HCR. A SNAP25 cleavage assay revealed that immunized sera blocked SNAP25 cleavage of the BoNT/A toxin via BA15. In an in vivo experiment, mice and guinea pigs immunized with BA15 produced neutralizing antibodies that protected against 3,000 LD50 of BoNT/A. In conclusion, the results of both in vitro and in vivo assays showed that our BA15 vaccine candidate was similar to the recombinant host cell receptor-binding subunit vaccine. The inability of BA15to bind ganglioside shows that BA15 is a potential safe vaccine candidate.", "doi": "10.1080/21645515.2017.1405201", "title": "A mutated recombinant subunit vaccine protects mice and guinea pigs against botulinum type A intoxication.", "journal": ["Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics", "Hum Vaccin Immunother"]}
