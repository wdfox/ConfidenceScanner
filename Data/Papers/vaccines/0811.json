Here, we report host tolerance mechanisms that limit the development of CD4-binding site\u00a0(CD4bs), HCDR3-binder bnAbs via sequential HIV-1 Env vaccination. Vaccine-induced macaque CD4bs antibodies neutralize 7% of HIV-1 strains, recognize open Env trimers, and accumulate relatively modest somatic mutations. In naive CD4bs, unmutated common ancestor knock-in mice Env+B cell clones develop anergy and partial deletion at the transitional to mature B cell stage, but become Env- upon receptor editing. In comparison with repetitive Env immunizations, sequential Env administration rescue anergic Env+ (non-edited) precursor B cells. Thus, stepwise immunization initiates CD4bs-bnAb responses, but immune tolerance mechanisms restrict their development, suggesting that sequential immunogen-based vaccine regimens will likely need to incorporate strategies to expand bnAb precursor pools.", "doi": "10.1038/s41467-017-01336-3", "title": "Initiation of HIV neutralizing B cell lineages with sequential envelope immunizations.", "journal": ["Nature communications", "Nat Commun"]}
