The language was limited to English.Pairs of reviewers independently screened studies for eligibility, assessed the risk of bias, and extracted data from the included studies.A total of 19 cohort studies were eligible. The use of vaccines during any period of pregnancy was associated with lower risk of stillbirth (adjusted hazard ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval 0.69-0.92). No significant differences were found between the vaccinated versus unvaccinated groups in terms of the risks of spontaneous abortion, premature birth, and small for gestational age.The administration of H1N1 vaccines during pregnancy might reduce the risk of stillbirth, a complication associated with H1N1 infection.
