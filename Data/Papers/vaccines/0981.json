This study explored the experiences and practices of pharmacist vaccinators and the impact of vaccination pain on their practice.Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 pharmacists in the Greater Toronto Area. Transcribed interview data were coded and analyzed via thematic analysis.Data analysis revealed 4 main themes: 1) expanded scope of practice as an enhancement and challenge to relationships; 2) professional satisfaction and workload demands; 3) knowledge and attitudes regarding pain and fear; 4) practices regarding pain and fear management. Pharmacists reported satisfaction in their new role, despite the associated increased workload. Pharmacists felt that vaccination pain was not a key consideration when administering vaccines and that pain management was generally not necessary. Fear was identified as more important than pain and vaccinating children was challenging and time intensive. Pharmacists' main focus was on injection techniques in managing pain.These findings suggest that pharmacists are accepting of their role as vaccinators but more research is needed to examine impact on workload and pharmacist knowledge and perceptions of injection-related pain and fear.", "doi": "10.1080/21645515.2017.1403695", "title": "Pharmacists as vaccinators: An analysis of their experiences and perceptions of their new role.", "journal": ["Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics", "Hum Vaccin Immunother"]}
