Capsular polysaccharide\u2011based vaccines against serogroups\u00a0A, C, Y, and W135 are available; however, the development of a vaccine against N.\u00a0meningitidis\u00a0serogroup\u00a0B (NMB) has been problematic. NMB0315 is an outer membrane protein of NMB that may be a virulence factor for N.\u00a0meningitidis and a possible target for functional bactericidal antibodies. The present study aimed to develop a potent DNA vaccine against NMB by cloning the NMB0135 gene into the pcDNA3.1(+) vector to construct the recombinant plasmid pcDNA3.1(+)/NMB0315 (designated pNMB0315). pNMB0315 was transfected into eukaryotic COS\u20117 and\u00a0RAW264.7\u00a0cells to express the recombinant (r)NMB0315 protein. Protective immunogenicity of the DNA vaccine was assessed in an in\u00a0vivo mouse model. The levels of rNMB0315\u2011specific immunoglobulin\u00a0G (IgG), IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies in the pNMB0315\u2011immunized group increased dramatically up to week\u00a06 following the initial vaccination, and were significantly higher compared with the levels in the Control groups. The serum concentrations of interleukin\u20114 and interferon\u2011\u03b3 were significantly higher in the pNMB0315\u2011immunized group compared with the control groups. Following intraperitoneal challenge with a lethal dose of NMB strain MC58, the survival rate in the pNMB0315\u00a0+\u00a0CpG group was 70% (14 out of 20\u00a0mice) at 14\u00a0days; by contrast, all mice in the control groups succumbed within 3\u00a0days. The serum bactericidal titers of the pNMB0315\u00a0+\u00a0CpG group in\u00a0vitro reached 1:128 following three immunizations. The results indicated that pNMB0315 may serve as a promising DNA vaccine against NMB.", "doi": "10.3892/mmr.2017.8255", "title": "Construction and protective immunogenicity of DNA vaccine pNMB0315 against Neisseria\u00a0meningitidis serogroup B.", "journal": ["Molecular medicine reports", "Mol Med Rep"]}
