Since being approved in the early 1990s, aspecific immunotherapy has been a mainstay of treatment for mRCC and the only therapy that has demonstrated long-term cures for mRCC. However, in recent times there have been landmark advances made in the field of specific immunotherapy for a number of malignancies, including kidney cancer. This review outlines the range of immunobased agents currently available for the treatment of mRCC.", "doi": "10.2147/ITT.S134850", "title": "The current status of immunobased therapies for metastatic renal-cell carcinoma.", "journal": ["ImmunoTargets and therapy", "Immunotargets Ther"]}
