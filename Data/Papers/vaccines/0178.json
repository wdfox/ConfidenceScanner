Widespread PCV use nearly eradicated pneumococcal colonization by vaccine serotypes. Since 2008, however, colonization by PCV-serotype 19F has increased in Alaska residents. We describe the epidemiology of re-emerging serotype 19F colonization.We conducted annual cross-sectional colonization surveys from 2008 to 2013. We recruited children aged <5\u202fyears at 2 urban clinics and participants of all ages from Region-A (2 villages), Region-B (4 villages), and Region-C (2 villages). We interviewed participants and reviewed their medical records to obtain demographic information and determine PCV status. We obtained nasopharyngeal swab specimens from participants to identify pneumococci and to determine the pneumococcal serotype, antimicrobial resistance, and multilocus sequence type. We used the Cochran-Armitage test to assess for significant trends in colonization across time periods.Among participants aged <5\u202fyears, pneumococcal serotype 19F colonization remained unchanged from 2008-2009 (0.7%) to 2012-2013 (0.5%; P-value [P]\u202f=\u202f.54). Serotype 19F colonization increased from 2008-2009 to 2012-2013 among participants aged 5-11\u202fyears (0.3% to 3.2%; P\u202f<\u202f.01), participants 12-17\u202fyears (0.0% to 2.0%; P\u202f<\u202f.01), and participants aged \u226518\u202fyears (0.1% to 0.5%; P\u202f<\u202f.01). During 2012-2013, 85 (93%) of 91 pneumococcal serotype 19F isolates were identified among participants from Region B; the majority of serotype 19F isolates belonged to an antimicrobial nonsusceptibility pattern corresponding to a novel multilocus sequence type 9074.PCV continues to protect against serotype 19F colonization in vaccinated children aged <5\u202fyears. The direct PCV impact on serotype 19F colonization in persons aged 5-11\u202fyears and indirect impact in persons aged \u226512\u202fyears is waning, possibly because of a newly introduced genotype in Region-B.", "doi": "10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.12.035", "title": "Re-emergence of pneumococcal colonization by vaccine serotype 19F in persons aged \u22655 years after 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine introduction-Alaska, 2008-2013.", "journal": ["Vaccine", "Vaccine"]}
