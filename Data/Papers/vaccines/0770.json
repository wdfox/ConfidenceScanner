However, parental beliefs about vaccination are one of the major factors in achieving high vaccination rates. Thus, this study aims to assess the perceptions and attitudes regarding routine childhood immunization among Saudi parents.A cross sectional study with a pre-tested 18-item questionnaire was conducted using 467 randomly selected parents from the Hail region of Saudi Arabia in the period between February 1st, 2016, and February 1st, 2017. The validated questionnaire consisted of three sections that collected information on participants' demographics, parents' awareness of vaccine benefits, and parents' practices regarding the immunization of their children.Female and male parents comprised 54.5% (255) and 45.5% (212) of the sample, respectively, and the response and completion rates were 97%. The majority of the respondents had received a formal education (94.1%, 439), were gainfully employed (62.9%, 294) and had a regular monthly income (73.3%). The majority of the respondents were aware of childhood vaccinations (78.9%), completed vaccinations mandated for children up to 5\u202fyears (86.2%), encouraged other parents to do so (89.9%), and had easy access to vaccines (90.5%). Sixty to ninety percent of the respondents were knowledgeable regarding the health benefits of vaccinations in children, even though 18.4% of their children had experienced vaccination-related minor adverse effects during or after vaccination of which 23.2% required doctor's visits. Health care professionals were the most frequent source of parents' vaccine-related information (65.2%), and vaccination reminder services provided by the Ministry of Health (MOH) via mobile phones were cited by 57.5% of respondents.Confidence in and acceptance of childhood vaccinations, perceptions of vaccine-related health benefits and ease of access to immunizations appeared to be quite good among Saudi parents.", "doi": "10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.11.050", "title": "Parental perceptions, attitudes and acceptance of childhood immunization in Saudi Arabia: A cross sectional study.", "journal": ["Vaccine", "Vaccine"]}
