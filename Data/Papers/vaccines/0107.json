Although current vaccines are highly effective for controlling RHD, they are derived from infected rabbit livers and their use is thus associated with safety and animal-welfare concerns. In this study, we generated a recombinant lentogenic canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV2) vector expressing the RHDV vp60 gene, named rCAV2-VP60. rCAV2-VP60 expressed VP60 protein in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells as demonstrated by western blot and immunofluorescence assay. Polymerase chain reaction confirmed that the vp60 gene was successfully inserted into rCAV2-VP60 and was still detectable after 20 passages, indicating its stable genetic character. We evaluated the feasibility of rCAV2-VP60 as a live-virus-vectored RHD vaccine in rabbits. rCAV2-VP60 significantly induced specific antibodies to RHDV and provided effective protection against RHDV lethal challenge. These results suggest that rCAV2 expressing RHDV VP60 could be a safe and efficient candidate vaccine against RHDV in rabbits.", "doi": "10.1016/j.vetmic.2017.11.007", "title": "Recombinant canine adenovirus type 2 expressing rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus VP60 protein provided protection against RHD in rabbits.", "journal": ["Veterinary microbiology", "Vet.
