The recommendations are based on local epidemiological data, the hepatitis A virus infection characteristics and the global experience with the available vaccines. In relation to hepatitis A, Chile is no longer a highly endemic area but actually an intermediate one, currently concentrating cases in individuals over 15 years of age, with frequent outbreaks. In 2017 we have seen an important outbreak of genotype 1A in men who have sex with men (MSM). The current endemic, the presence of regular outbreaks, the frequency of natural disasters in Chile, together with the availability of safe, effective vaccines and local cost-effectiveness studies led us to propose measures for outbreak control for high risk groups protection and mid and long term, including a more definitive solution which is universal vaccination against this disease in small children.", "doi": "10.4067/s0716-10182017000400371", "title": "[Statement of the Advisory Committee on Immunizations of Sociedad Chilena de Infectolog\u00eda about outbreaks of hepatitis A in Chile].", "journal": ["Revista chilena de infectologia : organo oficial de la Sociedad Chilena de Infectologia", "Rev Chilena Infectol"]}
