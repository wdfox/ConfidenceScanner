Here we show that immunizations of pigs with vesicular stomatitis virus- and classical swine fever virus-derived replicon (VRP) particles expressing the nucleoprotein (NP) of H1N1 A/swine/Belzig/2/01 induced potent antibody and T-cell responses against influenza A virus. In contrast to a conventional whole inactivated virus vaccine, the VRP vaccines induced both NP-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells responses, including interferon-\u03b3 and tumor-necrosis-factor dual-secreting cell. Although T-cells and antibody responses were cross-reactive with the heterologous H1N2 A/swine/Bakum/R757/2010 challenge virus, they did not provide protection against infection. Surprisingly, vaccinated pigs showed enhanced virus shedding, lung inflammation and increased levels of systemic and lung interferon-\u03b1 as well as elevated lung interleukin-6. In conclusion, our study shows that NP, although efficacious in the mouse model, appears not to be a promising stand-alone vaccine antigen for pigs.", "doi": "10.1038/s41598-017-16419-w", "title": "Virus replicon particle vaccines expressing nucleoprotein of influenza A virus mediate enhanced inflammatory responses in pigs.", "journal": ["Scientific reports", "Sci Rep"]}
