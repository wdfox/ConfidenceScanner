Many vaccines against encapsulated bacterial pathogens require generation of functional anti-capsular antibodies to mediate protection against infection and disease. Here it is shown that the generation of such antibody responses to S. aureus in vivo and in vitro requires the presence of O-acetyl modifications on the capsular polysaccharides. O-acetylation of S. aureus capsular polysaccharide therefore should be monitored carefully during vaccine development and production. This finding may provide additional insight into the previous failure of a S. aureus capsular polysaccharide conjugate vaccine.", "doi": "10.1080/21645515.2017.1386360", "title": "O-Acetylation is essential for functional antibody generation against Staphylococcus aureus capsular polysaccharide.", "journal": ["Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics", "Hum Vaccin Immunother"]}
