Inclusion body hepatitis (IBH) is caused by FAdV-7, 8a, 8b (species E) and FAdV-2 and 11 (species D). Commercial vaccines against IBH are not available in Canada. Autogenous FAdV broiler breeder vaccines are now used in some areas where outbreaks of IBH are occurring. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a bivalent (species D and E) live and an inactivated FAdV broiler breeder vaccine in protecting broiler chicks against IBH through maternal antibody (MtAb) transfer. FAdV seronegative broiler breeders (n\u202f=\u202f300/group) received either a live or inactivated bivalent (FAdV-8b-SK\u202f+\u202fFAdV-11-1047) vaccine. The live vaccine (1\u202f\u00d7\u202f104 TCID50 of each virus/bird) was given orally once at 16\u202fweeks of age and the inactivated vaccine (1\u202f\u00d7\u202f106TCID50 of each virus\u202f+\u202f20% Emulsigen D) was given intramuscularly at 16 and 19\u202fweeks of age. Controls (n\u202f=\u202f150) were given saline orally. The inactivated vaccine group was boosted 3\u202fweeks later with the same vaccine. Neutralizing antibodies (NAb) in sera (n\u202f=\u202f10) were detected at 19, 22, 30 and 48\u202fweeks of age. NAb were able to neutralize various FAdV serotypes within species D and E. Mean NAb were similar in the both live and killed vaccine groups at 19, 30 and 48\u202fweeks and ranged from 2.4 to 3.7 log10. Approximately 26\u202f\u00b1\u202f7% of MtAbs were passively transferred through eggs to day-old chicks. Progeny challenged with a lethal dose (1\u202f\u00d7\u202f107 TCID50/bird intramuscularly) of FAdV-8b-SK, FAdV-11-1047, or FAdV-2-685 (n\u202f=\u202f90/group) at 14\u202fdays post-hatch (dph) showed 98-100% protection in broiler chicks to homologous or heterologous FAdV challenges. Our data suggests that a bivalent live and an inactivated FAdV vaccine are equally effective and have the potential for the control of IBH.", "doi": "10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.12.047", "title": "Inactivated and live bivalent fowl adenovirus (FAdV8b\u202f+\u202fFAdV11) breeder vaccines provide broad-spectrum protection in chicks against inclusion body hepatitis (IBH).", "journal": ["Vaccine", "Vaccine"]}
