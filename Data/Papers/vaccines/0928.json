In this study, the therapeutic experiments were designed in order to evaluate antitumor effect against the syngeneic TC-1 tumor model. The anti-tumor\u00a0efficacy of a HPV-16 E7 DNA vaccine adjuvanted with melatonin (MLT) was evaluated in a C57BL/6 mouse\u00a0tumor\u00a0model by measuring\u00a0tumor\u00a0growth post vaccination and the survival rate of\u00a0tumor-bearing\u00a0mice, analyzing the specific lymphocyte proliferation responses in control and vaccinated\u00a0mice\u00a0by MTT assay. The\u00a0E7-specific cytotoxic T cells (CTL) were analyzed by\u00a0lymphocyte\u00a0proliferation and lactate dehydrogenates (LDH) release assays. IFN-\u03b3, IL-4 and TNF-\u03b1 secretion in splenocyte cultures as well as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and IL-10 in the tumor microenvironment were assayed by ELISA. Our results demonstrated that subcutaneous administration of C57BL/6\u00a0mice\u00a0with a DNA vaccine adjuvanted with MLT dose-dependently and significantly induced strong HPV16 E7-specific CD8+ cytotoxicity and IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 responses capable of reducing HPV-16 E7-expressing tumor volume. A significantly higher level of E7-specific T-cell proliferation was also found in the adjuvanted vaccine group. Furthermore, tumor growth was significantly inhibited when the DNA vaccine was combined with MLT and the survival time of TC-1 tumor bearing mice was also significantly prolonged. In vivo studies further demonstrated that MLT decreased the accumulation of IL-10 and VEGF in the tumor microenvironment of vaccinated mice. These data indicate that melatonin as an adjuvant augmented the cancer vaccine efficiency against HPV-associated tumors in a dose dependent manner.", "doi": "10.1007/s00705-017-3647-z", "title": "Enhancement of therapeutic DNA vaccine potency by melatonin through inhibiting VEGF expression and induction of antitumor immunity mediated by CD8+ T cells.", "journal": ["Archives of virology", "Arch.
