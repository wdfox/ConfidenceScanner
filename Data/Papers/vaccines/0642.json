Curative therapies and vaccines are lacking, mainly due to lack of a long-term culturing system of this parasite. Here, we show that COLO-680N cells infected with two different Cryptosporidium parvum strains produce sufficient infectious oocysts to infect subsequent cultures, showing a substantial fold increase in production, depending on the experiment, over the most optimistic HCT-8 models. Oocyst identity was confirmed using a variety of microscopic- and molecular-based methods. This culturing system will accelerate research on Cryptosporidium and the development of anti-Cryptosporidium drugs.", "doi": "10.1016/j.ijpara.2017.10.001", "title": "A cell culture platform for Cryptosporidium that enables long-term cultivation and new tools for the systematic investigation of its biology.", "journal": ["International journal for parasitology", "Int.
