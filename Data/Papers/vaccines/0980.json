We conducted a descriptive observational postlicensure safety surveillance study in Kaiser Permanente Southern California and Northern California to assess congenital anomaly and miscarriage among pregnancies exposed to 4vHPV. Using electronic medical records, we identified women who received a dose of 4vHPV between August 2006 and March 2008 within 30\u00a0days preconception or any time during a possible pregnancy. A broad algorithm was developed using diagnostic and procedure codes and laboratory tests to identify pregnancy, congenital anomalies, and miscarriages. Medical records of all potential congenital anomaly cases and a random sample of 100 potential miscarriage cases were reviewed to confirm pregnancy exposure and diagnosis. Results were reviewed by an independent Safety Review Committee (SRC). Among the population of 189,629 females who received at least one dose of 4vHPV during the study period, 2,678 females were identified as possibly having a 4vHPV-exposed pregnancy. Among 170 potential congenital anomalies identified, 44 (26%) were found to be both 4vHPV-exposed and confirmed congenital anomaly cases. Among the 633 potential miscarriages identified, the records of a random sample of 100 cases were reviewed, and 9 cases (9%) were confirmed as 4vHPV-exposed miscarriages. The SRC noted no safety signal for congenital anomaly or miscarriage associated with 4vHPV exposure during pregnancy. The rate of major congenital anomaly (3.6%) was in the range of background estimates from the literature. There was no apparent pattern of timing of 4vHPV exposure among 4vHPV-exposed miscarriages.", "doi": "10.1080/21645515.2017.1403702", "title": "Postlicensure safety surveillance of congenital anomaly and miscarriage among pregnancies exposed to quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine.", "journal": ["Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics", "Hum Vaccin Immunother"]}
