The annual trivalent vaccine induced significant homologous seroconversion in 14-35.6% of individuals in each vaccine campaign.The population \u226565 years has low-moderate seroprotection against B influenza lineages. Trivalent vaccination induced a slight increase of seroprotection. The trivalent vaccine should be administered to all individuals \u226565 years in all vaccine campaigns.", "doi": "10.1016/j.eimc.2017.10.021", "title": "Prevalence of antibodies and humoral response after seasonal trivalent vaccination against influenza B lineages in an elderly population of Spain.", "journal": ["Enfermedades infecciosas y microbiologia clinica", "Enferm.
