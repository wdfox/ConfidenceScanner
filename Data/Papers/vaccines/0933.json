Factors that contribute to this include a lack of broad coverage by current vaccines and continual emergence of novel virus strains. Further complicating matters, when influenza viruses infect a host, severe infections can develop when bacterial pathogens invade. Secondary bacterial infections (SBIs) contribute to a significant proportion of influenza-related mortality, with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Haemophilus influenzae as major coinfecting pathogens. Vaccines against bacterial pathogens can reduce coinfection incidence and severity, but few vaccines are available and those that are, may have decreased efficacy in influenza virus-infected hosts. While some studies indicate a benefit of vaccine-induced immunity in providing protection against SBIs, a comprehensive understanding is lacking. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge of viral and bacterial vaccine availability, the generation of protective immunity from these vaccines, and the effectiveness in limiting influenza-associated bacterial infections.", "doi": "10.1089/vim.2017.0138", "title": "The Unexpected Impact of Vaccines on Secondary Bacterial Infections Following Influenza.", "journal": ["Viral immunology", "Viral Immunol."]}
