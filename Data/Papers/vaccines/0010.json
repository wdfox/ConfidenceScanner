The percentage of viable cells measured by flow cytometry along with the total number of organisms in BCG vaccines, as determined on a cell counter, was used to quantify the number of viable cells.Pearson correlation coefficients of FACS and CFU assays for percutaneous and intradermal BCG vaccines were 0.6962 and 0.7428, respectively, indicating a high correlation. The coefficient of variation value of the FACS assay was less than 7%, which was 11 times lower than that of the CFU assay.This study contributes to the evaluation of new potency test method for FACS-based determination of viable cells in BCG vaccines. Accordingly, quality control of BCG vaccines can be significantly improved.", "doi": "10.24171/j.phrp.2017.8.6.06", "title": "Development of a New Approach to Determine the Potency of Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin Vaccines Using Flow Cytometry.", "journal": ["Osong public health and research perspectives", "Osong Public Health Res Perspect"]}
