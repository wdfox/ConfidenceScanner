In the Schistosoma mansoni (Sm)-endemic Lake Victoria islands (Uganda), we recently observed positive helminth-allergy associations, despite low ARD prevalence. To understand how Sm-induced cytokine and antibody profiles might influence allergic response profiles in this population, we assessed Schistosoma worm (SWA)- and egg antigen (SEA)-specific Th1 (IFN-\u03b3), Th2 (IL-5, IL-13) and regulatory (IL-10) cytokine profiles (n\u00a0=\u00a0407), and total (n\u00a0=\u00a0471), SWA-, SEA- and allergen (house dust mite [HDM] and cockroach)-specific (as)IgE and IgG4 profiles (n\u00a0=\u00a02117) by ELISA. Wheeze was inversely associated with SWA-specific IFN-\u03b3 (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) and IL-10 (P\u00a0=\u00a0.058), and SEA-specific IL-5 (P\u00a0=\u00a0.004). Conversely, having a detectable asIgE response was positively associated with SWA-specific IL-5 (P\u00a0=\u00a0.006) and IL-10 (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Total, SWA-, SEA- and allergen-specific IgE and IgG4 responses were higher among Sm Kato-Katz positive (SmKK+) and skin prick test (SPT)+ individuals compared to SmKK- and SPT- individuals. However, total and asIgG4/IgE ratios were lower among SPT+ and wheezing individuals. We conclude that, in this population, helminth-induced antibody and cytokine responses may underlie individual positive helminth-atopy associations, while the overall IgG4-IgE balance may contribute to the low overall prevalence of clinical allergies in such settings.", "doi": "10.1111/pim.12506", "title": "Schistosoma mansoni-specific immune responses and allergy in Uganda.", "journal": ["Parasite immunology", "Parasite Immunol."]}
