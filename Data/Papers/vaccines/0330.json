Accelerated dosing HAV/HBV vaccine and tetanus booster were administered and antibody response was measured at 0, 1, 3, 8, and 24\u202fweeks.Pre-vaccine plasma IP10, IL-6, and sCD14 levels were elevated in both HCV and HIV-infected participants, while sCD163 was also elevated in HCV-infected participants. Pre-immunization tetanus antibody levels were lower in HIV-infected than in uninfected participants, while vaccine induced antibody responses were intact in HCV and HIV-infected participants. After HAV/HBV vaccination, HCV and HIV-infected participants had lower and less durable HAV and HBV antibody responses than uninfected controls. Among HCV-infected participants, pre-vaccine plasma IP10, IL-6, sCD14, and sCD163 levels inversely correlated with HAV, HBV and tetanus antibody responses after vaccine. Low HAV/HBV vaccine responses in HIV-infected participants prohibited assessment of immune correlates.During HCV and HIV infection markers of systemic inflammation reflect immune dysfunction as demonstrated by poor response to HAV/HBV neo-antigen vaccine.", "doi": "10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.12.018", "title": "Pre-vaccine plasma levels of soluble inflammatory indices negatively predict responses to HAV, HBV, and tetanus vaccines in HCV and HIV infection.", "journal": ["Vaccine", "Vaccine"]}
