This study reports the analysis of complete genomes of G1P[8] strains, two each recovered from Rotarix\u2122 vaccine recipients and non-recipients hospitalized for acute gastroenteritis in Pune, western India. All four strains showed a genogroup-1 backbone with intra-genotypic diversity in the VP7 and VP4 gene segments and a homogeneous constellation of the internal gene segments. A divergence in the range of 1.4-17.3% from Rotarix\u2122 vaccine strain was revealed by structural and non-structural genes of the strains at nucleotide and amino acid level. These data reflect ability of such G1P[8] strains to cause rotavirus infections in humans.", "doi": "10.1002/jmv.25007", "title": "Full genomic analysis of G1P[8] rotavirus strains recovered from rotavirus vaccinated and non-vaccinated children hospitalized for acute gastroenteritis in Pune, western India.", "journal": ["Journal of medical virology", "J.
