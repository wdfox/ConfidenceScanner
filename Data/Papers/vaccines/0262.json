A major limitation to current vaccinations and therapies against influenza virus is pathogenic diversity generated by shift and drift. A simple, cost-effective passive immunization strategy via in vivo production of cross-protective antibody molecules may augment existing vaccines and antiviral drugs in seasonal and pandemic outbreaks. We engineered synthetic plasmid DNA to encode two novel and broadly cross-protective monoclonal antibodies targeting influenza A and B. We utilized enhanced in vivo delivery of these plasmid DNA-encoded monoclonal antibody (DMAb) constructs and show that this strategy induces robust levels of functional antibodies directed against influenza A and B viruses in mouse sera. Mice receiving a single inoculation with anti-influenza A DMAb survive lethal Group 1 H1 and Group 2 H3 influenza A challenges, while inoculation with anti-influenza B DMAb yields protection against lethal Victoria and Yamagata lineage influenza B morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, these two DMAbs can be delivered coordinately resulting in exceptionally broad protection against both influenza A and B. We demonstrate this protection is similar to that achieved by conventional protein antibody delivery. DMAbs warrant further investigation as a novel immune therapy platform with distinct advantages for sustained immunoprophylaxis against influenza.", "doi": "10.1038/s41541-017-0020-x", "title": "DMAb inoculation of synthetic cross reactive antibodies protects against lethal influenza A and B infections.", "journal": ["NPJ vaccines", "NPJ Vaccines"]}
