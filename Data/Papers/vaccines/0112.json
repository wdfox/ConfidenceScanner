Further, with the non-availability of the vaccines against Ebola virus, concerns about the public health emerge. In this regard, this review summarizes the structure, genetics and potential of Ebola virus to be used as a bioweapon. We highlight the recent advances in the treatment strategies and vaccine development against Ebola virus. The understanding of these aspects might lead to effective treatment practices which can be applied during the future outbreaks of Ebola.", "doi": "10.1007/s13337-017-0398-0", "title": "Recent advances in vaccine development against Ebola threat as bioweapon.", "journal": ["Virusdisease", "Virusdisease"]}
