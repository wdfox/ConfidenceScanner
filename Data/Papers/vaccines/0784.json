Vaccinated and unvaccinated patients had generally similar demographic characteristics. There were no differences in the overall rates of influenza or ILI between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients overall, or in any individual season. There was no difference in the rates of influenza or ILI between patients who received 1 dose of vaccine and those who received 2 doses. Time to first influenza infection and time to first ILI in vaccinated and unvaccinated patients were not different.TIV did not protect children and adolescents with acute leukemia against laboratory-confirmed influenza or ILI. Future prospective studies should assess TIV effectiveness in high-risk subpopulations and alternative strategies to prevent influenza should be considered in this population.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jpeds.2017.08.071", "title": "The Effectiveness of Trivalent Inactivated Influenza Vaccine in Children with Acute Leukemia.", "journal": ["The Journal of pediatrics", "J.
