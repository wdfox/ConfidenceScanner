Recent developments in cancer immunology have led to the better understanding of role of immune regulatory mechanisms in cancer. There is rapid progress in this field in the last few years. Several clinical studies report the efficacy of immunotherapies for treating cancer. The immunology-based anticancer therapies have shown better safety profiles in clinic as compared to other chemotherapeutic agents, thus increasing interest in this area. This review summarizes recent advances in cancer immunology and discusses tumor microenvironment and immunology-based anticancer therapies, including vaccines and therapies targeting immune checkpoints.", "doi": "10.1016/j.biopha.2017.11.126", "title": "Recent advances in cancer immunology and immunology-based anticancer therapies.", "journal": ["Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie", "Biomed.
