Although about a third of parents cite herd immunity as motivation for vaccination, its efficacy in addressing vaccine hesitancy isn't clear. Multifaceted interventions (encompassing improved access to vaccines, immunization mandates, and patient education) may produce a \u226525% increase in vaccine uptake in groups with vaccine hesitancy and low utilization. Correcting false information about influenza vaccination improves perceptions about the vaccine, but may decrease intention to vaccinate in parents who already have strong concerns about safety. Discussions about vaccines that are more paternalistic (presumptive rather than participatory) are associated with higher vaccination rates, but lower visit satisfaction. Providers should thoroughly address patient concerns about safety and encourage vaccine use.", "doi": null, "title": "Clinical Inquiries: Which interventions are effective in managing parental vaccine refusal?", "journal": ["The Journal of family practice", "J Fam Pract"]}
