Der\u00a0f\u00a020 is a novel allergen of Dermatophagoides\u00a0farina (Der\u00a0f), which is an arginine kinase. In the present study, the B\u2011cell and T\u2011cell epitopes of Der\u00a0f\u00a020 were predicted. The protein attribution, patterns, physicochemical properties and secondary structure of Der\u00a0f\u00a020 were also predicted. Der\u00a0f\u00a020 is a member of the ATP:guanido phosphotransferase family and contains a phosphagen kinase pattern. Using homology modeling, the present study constructed a reasonable tertiary structure of Der\u00a0f\u00a020. Using BcePred, ABCpred, BCPred and BPAP systems, B\u2011cell epitopes at 20\u201125, 41\u201149, 111\u2011118, 131\u2011141, 170\u2011174 and 312\u2011321 were predicted. Using NetMHCIIpan\u20113.0 and NetMHCII\u20112.2, T\u2011cell epitopes were predicted at 194\u2011202, 239\u2011247 and 274\u2011282. These results provide a theoretical basis for the design off Der\u00a0f\u00a020 epitope\u2011based vaccines.", "doi": "10.3892/mmr.2017.8066", "title": "Homology modeling and prediction of B\u2011cell and T\u2011cell epitopes of the house dust mite allergen Der\u00a0f\u00a020.", "journal": ["Molecular medicine reports", "Mol Med Rep"]}
