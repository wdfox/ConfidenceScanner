The HPV vaccination uptake rate (at least 1 dose) varied significantly among countries, ranging from 2.4% to 94.4%. Scotland achieved the highest uptake of all the studies included in this review, while Hong Kong had the lowest, at 2.4% to 9.1%. This review also showed that adolescents had limited awareness and knowledge of HPV infections and vaccines, even 10 years after the vaccine had become available.It is recommended that barriers to the uptake of the vaccine should be addressed, and that school-based sexual health education of HPV infection and vaccine promotion should be reinforced.", "doi": "10.1177/2150131917742299", "title": "The Uptake of Human Papillomavirus Vaccination and Its Associated Factors Among Adolescents: A Systematic Review.", "journal": ["Journal of primary care & community health", "J Prim Care Community Health"]}
