In this review, the use of tumors to gather genetic and expression data will first be explored. Next, techniques to assess tumor immunity are reviewed, including HLA status, predicted neoantigens, immune microenvironment deconvolution, and T-cell receptor sequencing. Attempts to integrate these data are in early stages of development and are discussed in this review. Finally, we review the application of these informatics strategies to therapy development, with a focus on vaccines, adoptive cell transfer, and checkpoint blockade therapies.", "doi": "10.1093/annonc/mdx682", "title": "Informatics for cancer immunotherapy.", "journal": ["Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology", "Ann.
