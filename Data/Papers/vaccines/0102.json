Data contributed by 60 public health centers were used to determine the annual incidence rates (per 1000 newborns) of vaccination refusal, and to identify the reasons for refusal among the mothers. The trend analysis revealed a 2.2-times increment in the incidence rates of vaccination refusal from 4.72 in 2013 to 10.51 in 2015, followed by a 52.2% reduction to 5.02 in 2016 ( P = .046). Besides, the proportion of mothers who refused vaccination because of religious belief reduced from 78% between 2013 and 2015 to 67.1% in 2016 ( P = .005). Overall, the finding confirms the positive impact of the educational and religious interventions introduced by the State Health Department of Kedah since January 2016; nonetheless, efforts to strengthen the existing strategies and thereby to maximize the vaccination coverage in Kedah are warranted.", "doi": "10.1177/1010539517751312", "title": "Trends in Vaccination Refusal in Children Under 2 Years of Age in Kedah, Malaysia: A 4-Year Review From 2013 to 2016.", "journal": ["Asia-Pacific journal of public health", "Asia Pac J Public Health"]}
