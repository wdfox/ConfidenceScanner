These recommendations have largely been based on experimental models of inflammation under different vaccine formulations. In none of these studies did sarcomas occur. It is scientifically untenable to address FISS risk based on propensity of vaccines to elicit differential inflammatory responses if none of those responses led to sarcoma development. Although the recommendations may ultimately be found to be prescient and valid, it will take considerable additional research before this can happen. Until then, such guidelines must be regarded with skepticism.", "doi": "10.1016/j.cvsm.2017.10.007", "title": "Prevention of Feline Injection-Site Sarcomas: Is There a Scientific Foundation for Vaccine Recommendations at This Time?", "journal": ["The Veterinary clinics of North America.
