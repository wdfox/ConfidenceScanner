A multitude of approaches have been used in the management of posttransplant relapse. This review focuses on recent data with cellular therapies designed to treat or prevent posttransplant relapse of hematologic malignancies, although many of these therapeutic approaches also have applications to solid tumors and in the nontransplant setting. Currently available cell therapies include second transplant, natural killer cells, monocyte-derived dendritic cell vaccines, and lymphocytes via donor lymphocyte infusion, antigen-primed cytotoxic T lymphocytes, cytokine-induced killer cells, marrow-infiltrating lymphocytes, and chimeric antigen receptor T cells. These treatment options offer the prospect for improved relapse-free survival after HSCT.", "doi": "10.1182/asheducation-2017.1.708", "title": "Cells to prevent/treat relapse following allogeneic stem cell transplantation.", "journal": ["Hematology.
