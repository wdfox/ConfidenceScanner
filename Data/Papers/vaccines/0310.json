To develop a novel surface display system for the popular scaffold protein 10th human fibronectin type III domain (10Fn3) in Escherichia coli cells, we have used an \u03b1-helical linker and a C-terminal translocator domain from previously characterized autotransporter from Psychrobacter cryohalolentis K5T. The level of 10Fn3 passenger exposure at the cell surface provided by the hybrid autotransporter Fn877 and its C-terminal variants was low. To improve it, the fusion proteins containing 10Fn3 and the native autotransporter passenger Est877 or the cold-active esterase EstPc in different orientations were constructed and expressed as passenger domains. Using the whole-cell ELISA and activity assays, we have demonstrated that N-terminal position of EstPc in the passenger significantly improves the efficiency of the surface display of 10Fn3 in E. coli cells.", "doi": "10.1007/s00792-017-0990-7", "title": "Fusion with the cold-active esterase facilitates autotransporter-based surface display of the 10th human fibronectin domain in Escherichia coli.", "journal": ["Extremophiles : life under extreme conditions", "Extremophiles"]}
