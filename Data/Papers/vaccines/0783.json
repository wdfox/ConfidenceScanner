These are potential targets for anticancer vaccines; however, to date, no such vaccine has reached the clinic. One factor that may complicate the success of this effort is the lability of the glycosidic bond. Acetal-free carbohydrates are analogues that lack the glycosidic linkage by replacing either the endo or exo oxygen with a methylene. This chapter summarizes the seminal syntheses of the mucin TACAs, provides an overview of common techniques for the synthesis of carbasugars and C-glycosides, reviews the syntheses published to date of acetal-free TACA analogues, and provides an overview of their observed biological activity. We conclude by offering a summation of the challenges remaining to the field biologically and the potential that acetal-free TACAs have of answering several basic questions in carbohydrate immunology.", "doi": "10.1016/bs.accb.2017.10.003", "title": "The Synthesis and Biological Characterization of Acetal-Free Mimics of the Tumor-Associated Carbohydrate Antigens.", "journal": ["Advances in carbohydrate chemistry and biochemistry", "Adv Carbohydr Chem Biochem"]}
