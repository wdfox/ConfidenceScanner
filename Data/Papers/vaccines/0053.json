The ability of pH-sensitive liposomes containing OVA and \u03b1-GalCer to stimulate cellular and humoral immune responses in vivo was compared with OVA-encapsulating pH-sensitive liposomes as well as with OVA alone. After immunization, significant OVA-specific antibodies were detected in the serum. When sera were analyzed for isotype distribution, antigen-specific IgG1 antibody responses were noted in mice immunized with OVA alone, whereas immunization with OVA-containing pH-sensitive liposomes and with pH-sensitive liposomes containing OVA and \u03b1-GalCer resulted in the induction of OVA-specific IgG1 and IgG2b antibody responses. Moreover, more substantial production of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 was demonstrated in spleen cells from mice immunized with pH-sensitive liposomes having OVA and \u03b1-GalCer than OVA-containing pH-sensitive liposomes in vitro. Spleen cells from the immunized mice showed strong cytotoxic activity against E.G7-OVA tumor cells. In addition, prophylactic vaccination efficacy against tumor formation was evaluated. In all mice immunized with pH-sensitive liposomes having OVA and \u03b1-GalCer, immunization provided substantial protection from tumor formation. The therapeutic efficacy of pH-sensitive liposomes containing OVA and \u03b1-GalCer against already established E.G7-OVA tumors was also investigated. Tumor growth was reduced significantly in all mice treated with pH-sensitive liposomes having OVA and \u03b1-GalCer. The provided evidence on the advantage of antigen and \u03b1-GalCer co-encapsulation into pH-sensitive liposomes should be considered in the design of future cancer vaccines for prophylactic and therapeutic purposes.", "doi": "10.1292/jvms.17-0491", "title": "Evaluation of pH-sensitive fusogenic polymer-modified liposomes co-loaded with antigen and \u03b1-galactosylceramide as an anti-tumor vaccine.", "journal": ["The Journal of veterinary medical science", "J.
