In this study, we compared the adjuvanticity of two adjuvant formulations containing de-O-acylated lipooligosaccharide (dLOS), a toll-like receptor 4 agonist, on the Japanese encephalitis (JE) vaccine in mice. Mice were immunized once or twice at a two-week interval with inactivated JE vaccine in the absence or presence of adjuvant. We found that both the alum- and the liposome-based formulation induced significantly faster and higher serum IgG antibody responses as compared with the non-adjuvanted vaccine after either one or two immunizations. The antibody titers of the mouse immune sera correlated with 50% plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT50) antibody titers. In addition, the dLOS/liposome formulation was more effective in inducing a Th1-type immune response than the dLOS/alum formulation, as suggested by a strong antigen-specific interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 response. Based on these results, we suggest that both alum- and liposome-based adjuvant formulations containing dLOS may be used for the development of JE vaccines with improved immunogenicity.", "doi": "10.1007/s12272-017-0985-z", "title": "Comparison of the adjuvanticity of two adjuvant formulations containing de-O-acylated lipooligosaccharide on Japanese encephalitis vaccine in mice.", "journal": ["Archives of pharmacal research", "Arch.
