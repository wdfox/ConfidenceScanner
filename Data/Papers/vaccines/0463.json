In addition, there is an increasing susceptibility for infections in elderly people due to physiological aging of the immune system. The principles of vaccination are based on a targeted activation of the human immune system. Principally, a distinction is made between passive immunization, i.e. the application of specific antibodies against a pathogen and active immunization. In active immunization, i.e. vaccination, weakened (attenuated) or dead pathogens or components of pathogens (antigens) are administered. After a latency period that depends on the vaccine, complete immune protection is achieved and immunity is maintained for a certain period of time. In contrast to dead vaccines, by the use of live vaccines there is always a\u00a0risk for infection with the administered vaccine. In passive immunization antibodies are administered. As a rule passive immunization is carried out in persons who have had contact with an infected person and in whom no or uncertain immunity against the corresponding disease is present. Based on the recommendations of the Standing Committee on Vaccination (STIKO), influenza, pneumococcal, herpes zoster, early summer meningoencephalitis (FSME) and travel vaccines are described.", "doi": "10.1007/s00108-017-0358-1", "title": "[Vaccination in advanced age].", "journal": ["Der Internist", "Internist (Berl)"]}
