Because most of the pathogens responsible for childhood diarrhea infect the gastrointestinal mucosa, providing protective immunity at the mucosal surface is an ideal way to control pathogen invasion and toxic activity. Mucosal (e.g., oral, nasal) vaccines are superior to systemic (subcutaneous or intramuscular) vaccination for conferring both mucosal and systemic pathogen-specific immune responses. Therefore, great efforts has been focused on the development of cost-effective mucosal vaccines for the past 50 years. Recent progress in plant genetic engineering has revolutonized the production of inexpensive and safe recombinant vaccine antigens. For example, rice plant biotechnology has facilitated the development of a cold-chain-free rice-based oral subunit vaccine against Vibrio cholerae. Furthermore, this technology has led to the creation of a rice-based oral antibody for prophyalaxis and treatment of rotavirus gastroenteritis. This review summarizes current perspectives regarding the mucosal immune system and the development of mucosal vaccines and therapeutic antibodies, particularly rice-based products, and discusses future prospects regarding mucosal vaccines for children.
