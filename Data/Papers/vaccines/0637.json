Vaccination initiates a process that stimulates development of a robust and long-lived immune response to the disease agents in the vaccine. Side effects are sometimes associated with vaccination. These vary from development of acute hypersensitivity responses to vaccine components to local tissue reactions that are annoying but not significantly detrimental to the patient. The pathogenesis of these responses and the consequent clinical outcomes are discussed. Overstimulation of the immune response and the potential relationship to autoimmunity is evaluated in relation to genetic predisposition.", "doi": "10.1016/j.cvsm.2017.10.005", "title": "Adverse Reactions to Vaccination: From Anaphylaxis to Autoimmunity.", "journal": ["The Veterinary clinics of North America.
