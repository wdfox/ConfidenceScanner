Areas covered: This review discusses the pre-clinical research and if available, clinical evaluation of the currently available EBOV vaccine candidates, while emphasizing the translatability of pre-clinical data generated in the NHP model to clinical data in humans. Expert opinion: Despite the existence of many successful EBOV vaccine candidates in the pre-clinical stages, only two platforms became the focus of Phase 2/3 efficacy trials in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea near the peak of the epidemic: the Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-vectored vaccine and the chimpanzee adenovirus type 3 (ChAd3)-vectored vaccine. The results of three distinct clinical trials involving these candidates may soon pave the way for a licensed, safe and efficacious EBOV vaccine to help combat future epidemics.", "doi": "10.1080/14712598.2018.1404572", "title": "From bench to almost bedside: the long road to a licensed Ebola virus vaccine.", "journal": ["Expert opinion on biological therapy", "Expert Opin Biol Ther"]}
