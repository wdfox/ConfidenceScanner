Instead, a broadly protective influenza vaccine should aim at inducing antibody- and/or cell-mediated immunity against conserved viral proteins. Vacc-FLU is a peptide based vaccine combining conserved B and T cell epitopes. Peptide selection was done using a proprietary peptide design platform technology focusing on responses to human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-restricted epitopes. Immunization of wild-type mice and mice transgenic for HLA-A2.1 with the peptide mix successfully induced both humoral and cell mediated immune responses. Partial protection from severe weight loss upon challenge was observed in both mouse strains but was stronger and observed at lower vaccine doses in transgenic mice. Our results show that the Vacc-FLU peptide mix is capable of inducing IFN\u03b3-producing T cells and antibody-producing B cells which can protect from severe disease symptoms upon infection.", "doi": "10.1016/j.virol.2017.11.018", "title": "A novel peptide-based vaccine candidate with protective efficacy against influenza A in a mouse model.", "journal": ["Virology", "Virology"]}
