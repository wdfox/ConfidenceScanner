We investigated cellular immune correlates that contribute to preventing disease against human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) by nanoparticle vaccine delivery. Formalin-inactivated RSV (FI-RSV) vaccines and virus-like nanoparticles carrying RSV fusion proteins (F VLP) were investigated in mice. The FI-RSV vaccination caused severe weight loss and histopathology by inducing interleukin (IL)-4+, interferon (IFN)-\u03b3+, IL-4+IFN-\u03b3+ CD4+ T cells, eosinophils, and lung plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DCs), CD103+ DCs, and CD11b+ DCs. In contrast, the F VLP-immune mice induced protection against RSV without disease by inducing natural killer cells, activated IFN-\u03b3+, and IFN-\u03b3+ tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1+ CD8+ T cells in the lung and bronchiolar airways during RSV infection but not disease-inducing DCs and effector T cells. Clodronate-mediated depletion studies provided evidence that alveolar macrophages that were present at high levels in the F VLP-immune mice play a role in modulating protective cellular immune phenotypes. There was an intrinsic difference between the F VLP and FI-RSV treatments in stimulating proinflammatory cytokines. The F VLP nanoparticle vaccination induced distinct innate and adaptive cellular subsets that potentially prevented lung disease after RSV infection.", "doi": "10.1166/jbn.2017.2341", "title": "Cellular Immune Correlates Preventing Disease Against Respiratory Syncytial Virus by Vaccination with Virus-Like Nanoparticles Carrying Fusion Proteins.", "journal": ["Journal of biomedical nanotechnology", "J Biomed Nanotechnol"]}
