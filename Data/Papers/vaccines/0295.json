The treatment of patients with TNBC remains a great clinical challenge. Preclinical reports support the combination immunotherapy of cancer vaccines and immune checkpoint blockades in non-immunogenic tumors. In this study, we constructed nanoparticles (NPs) to deliver an mRNA vaccine encoding tumor antigen MUC1 to dendritic cells (DCs) in lymph nodes to activate and expand tumor-specific T\u00a0cells. An anti-CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4) monoclonal antibody was combined with the mRNA vaccine to enhance the anti-tumor benefits. In\u00a0vivo studies demonstrated that the NP-based mRNA vaccine, targeted to mannose receptors on DCs, could successfully express tumor antigen in the DCs of the lymph node; that the NP vaccine could induce a strong, antigen-specific, in\u00a0vivo cytotoxic T lymphocyte response against TNBC 4T1 cells; and that combination immunotherapy of the vaccine and anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody could significantly enhance anti-tumor immune response compared to the vaccine or monoclonal antibody alone. These data support both the NP as a carrier for delivery of mRNA vaccine and a potential combination immunotherapy of the NP-based mRNA vaccine and the CTLA-4 inhibitor for\u00a0TNBC.", "doi": "10.1016/j.ymthe.2017.10.020", "title": "Combination Immunotherapy of MUC1 mRNA Nano-vaccine and CTLA-4 Blockade Effectively Inhibits Growth of Triple Negative Breast Cancer.", "journal": ["Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy", "Mol.
