More knowledge among care providers helps with regard to good medical practice and information.- Severe hypersensitivity reactions to vaccines are rare. Chicken-egg protein, gelatine and thiomersal are the most important vaccine components that may provoke severe reactions.- Acute treatment of patients with severe hypersensitivity reactions consists of intramuscular adrenaline.- In case of a severe reaction to a vaccine or a vaccine component, the subsequent course of action is determined by the physician referred to: the allergist or paediatric allergist. For most patients, vaccination or revaccination is possible in a setting where acute treatment is possible.- Slight side effects and delayed hypersensitivity reactions are not good reasons for additional measures with respect to vaccination.- It is important to record hypersensitivity reactions completely and unambiguously in the patient file.", "doi": null, "title": "[Hypersensitivity reactions and vaccines].", "journal": ["Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde", "Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd"]}
