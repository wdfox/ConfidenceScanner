Better vaccines for protection are needed to reduce disease incidence. Immunity to brucellosis and barriers to protection are discussed. The benefits and limitations of conventional and experimental brucellosis vaccines are outlined, and novel vaccination strategies needed to ultimately protect against brucellosis are introduced.", "doi": "10.1016/j.micinf.2017.12.006", "title": "Alternative strategies for vaccination to brucellosis.", "journal": ["Microbes and infection", "Microbes Infect."]}
