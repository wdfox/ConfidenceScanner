As with viral infections in general, immune responses are critical to determine the outcome of HEV infection. Accumulating studies in cell culture, animal models and patients have improved our understanding of HEV immunopathogenesis and informed the development of new antiviral therapies and effective vaccines. In this review, we discuss the recent progress on innate and adaptive immunity in HEV infection, and the implications for the devolopment of effective vaccines and immune-based therapies.", "doi": "10.1002/rmv.1964", "title": "Immunity against hepatitis E virus infection: Implications for therapy and vaccine development.", "journal": ["Reviews in medical virology", "Rev.
