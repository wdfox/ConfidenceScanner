To date, there is no clinically available vaccine to prevent cryptococcosis. Mice given an experimental pulmonary vaccination with a C. neoformans serotype A strain engineered to produce interferon-\u03b3, denoted H99\u03b3, are protected against a subsequent otherwise lethal experimental infection with C. neoformans serotype A. Thus, we determined the efficacy of immunization with C. neoformans strain H99\u03b3 to elicit broad-spectrum protection in BALB/c mice against multiple disparate Cryptococcus serotypes. We observed significantly increased survival rates and significantly decreased pulmonary fungal burden in H99\u03b3 immunized mice challenged with Cryptococcus serotypes A, B, or D compared to heat-killed H99\u03b3 (HKH99\u03b3) immunized mice. Results indicated that prolonged protection against Cryptococcus serotypes B or D in H99\u03b3 immunized mice was CD4+ T cell dependent and associated with the induction of predominantly Th1-type cytokine responses. Interestingly, immunization with H99\u03b3 did not elicit greater protection against challenge with the Cryptococcus serotype C tested either due to low overall virulence of this strain or enhanced capacity of this strain to evade host immunity. Altogether, these studies provide \"proof-of-concept\" for the development of a cryptococcal vaccine that provides cross-protection against multiple disparate serotypes of Cryptococcus.", "doi": "10.3389/fimmu.2017.01359", "title": "Induction of Broad-Spectrum Protective Immunity against Disparate Cryptococcus Serotypes.", "journal": ["Frontiers in immunology", "Front Immunol"]}
