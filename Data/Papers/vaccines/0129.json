Even though the infection has been studied for several decades, immune determinants important for virus control and mechanisms of long-term sequelae caused by infection are still insufficiently characterized. Animal models of congenital HCMV infection provide unique opportunity to study various aspects of human disease. In this review, we summarize current knowledge on the role of immune system in congenital CMV infection, with emphasis on lessons learned from mouse model of congenital CMV infection.", "doi": "10.1016/j.micinf.2017.12.010", "title": "Immune responses to congenital cytomegalovirus infection.", "journal": ["Microbes and infection", "Microbes Infect."]}
