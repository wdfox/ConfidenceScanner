The complete JEV genome of strain FC792 had the highest nucleotide homology (99.7%) and amino acid identity (99.4%) with the sequence of JEV strain SA14-14-2 (GenBank accession number AF315119). Phylogenetic analysis showed that strain FC792 had the closest phylogenetic relationship to the sequence of strain YUNNAN0901 (GenBank accession number JQ086762). This study will help us understand the molecular pathogenesis and genetic diversity of genotype III Japanese encephalitis virus in pigs.", "doi": "10.1128/genomeA.01054-17", "title": "Full-Length Genome Sequence of Japanese Encephalitis Virus Strain FC792, Isolated from Guangxi, China.", "journal": ["Genome announcements", "Genome Announc"]}
