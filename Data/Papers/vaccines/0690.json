The results may supply important information about vaccine studies in Turkey.Rotavirus antigen was detected by latex agglutination test and rotavirus RNA was detected by RT-PCR test. On the other hand, rotavirus positive samples were genotyped by semi-nested multiplex polymerase chain reaction.The highest rate of rotavirus positivity (46.9%) was observed among children in the 13 to 24 mo age group. All the positive-strains were in G1-4, G8-9, P [4], P [8], and P [9] genotypes. The most common G and P combination in present study was G9P[8] (n\u00a0=\u00a024, 28.9%).The present results indicated that the most prevalent genotypes were G1, G9, P8, G9P[8] and G1P[8] in authors' region. Rotavirus vaccines used in this region must include mainly these genotypes.", "doi": "10.1007/s12098-017-2540-9", "title": "Molecular Epidemiology of Rotavirus Strains in Under Five Children.", "journal": ["Indian journal of pediatrics", "Indian J Pediatr"]}
