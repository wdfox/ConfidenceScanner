The inability of mankind to control this infection stems from the fact that the vaccines and drugs that were once effective against TB are no longer efficacious. This has led to a search for new antituberculous agents and adjuvant therapy. Vitamins are being revisited for their role in pathogenicity as well as for their antimycobacterial properties. Vitamins such as biotin and thiamin are essential for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and are required for establishment of infection. On the other hand, vitamins such as Vitamin C and Vitamin D have been shown to possess antimycobacterial properties. To combat M. tuberculosis, innovative strategies need to be devised, keeping in mind the efficacy of the agent to be used. Vitamins can prove to be useful agents capable of modifying the life cycle and biology of M. tuberculosis. We present here a brief overview of the available knowledge on thiamin, biotin, Vitamin C, and Vitamin D, keeping TB treatment and control in perspective.", "doi": "10.4103/ijmy.ijmy_80_17", "title": "Role of Vitamins B, C, and D in the fight against tuberculosis.", "journal": ["International journal of mycobacteriology", "Int J Mycobacteriol"]}
