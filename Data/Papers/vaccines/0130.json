GAS strains with a mutation in their covR/S regulatory system are hypervirulent with an increased capacity for causing invasive disease. CovR/S mutants augment their virulence through the up-regulation of important virulence factors and target host immune surveillance primarily by inhibiting neutrophils. An in-depth understanding of the immunopathogenesis of covR/S mutants will facilitate the development of vaccine strategies and design. Ultimately, by targeting separate virulence mechanisms, multi-component vaccines may provide improved protective efficacy against hypervirulent GAS infections.", "doi": "10.1016/j.micinf.2017.12.009", "title": "Cellular interactions of covR/S mutant group A Streptococci.", "journal": ["Microbes and infection", "Microbes Infect."]}
