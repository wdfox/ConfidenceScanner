This could be valuable to combat human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) where it has not yet been possible to generate broadly reacting neutralizing antibodies with a vaccine. However, HIV-1 vaccines aimed at stimulating CD8+ T cells have had no success. In contrast, a cytomegalovirus vectored simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) vaccine enabled clearance of early SIV infection. This may open the door to the design of an effective HIV vaccine.", "doi": "10.1101/cshperspect.a029124", "title": "Is a Human CD8 T-Cell Vaccine Possible, and if So, What Would It Take?
