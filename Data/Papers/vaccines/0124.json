Because of decreased vaccine rates among the general population causing loss of herd immunity, we aimed to establish the safety and efficacy of revaccinating multiple myeloma patients on lenalidomide maintenance (LM). Of the 122 patients who were vaccinated after aHCT between 2010 and 2014 at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 91 (75%) were on LM. Vaccine responses were defined by increases between pre- and postvaccination titers. Reponses varied by vaccine type with 76% responding to pertussis, 70% diphtheria, 60% tetanus, 71% Haemophilus influenzae, and 58% pneumococcal. All patients retained minimal levels of polio immunity, but 27% responded with increased titers. Fewer patients received hepatitis A and B, but of those who did, 30% responded to hepatitis A and 40% to hepatitis B. No differences were seen in rates of response for those on LM at time of vaccination compared with those who were not. There were no vaccine-related adverse effects. Reimmunization with inactivated vaccines in patients on LM is therefore both safe and effective, offering this population immunity to vaccine-preventable diseases.", "doi": "10.1016/j.bbmt.2017.12.795", "title": "Revaccination after Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Is Safe and Effective in Patients with Multiple Myeloma Receiving Lenalidomide Maintenance.", "journal": ["Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation", "Biol.
