Interestingly, enhanced macroautophagic/autophagic activity is often found to be accompanied by necroptosis. However, the possible role of autophagy in the immunogenicity of necroptotic death remains largely obscure. In this study, we investigated the possible mechanistic correlation between phytochemical shikonin-induced autophagy and the shikonin-induced necroptosis for tumor immunogenicity. We show that shikonin can instigate RIPK1 (receptor [TNFRSF]-interacting serine-threonine kinase 1)- and RIPK3 (receptor-interacting serine-threonine kinase 3)-dependent necroptosis that is accompanied by enhanced autophagy. Shikonin-induced autophagy can directly contribute to DAMP upregulation. Counterintuitively, among the released and ectoDAMPs, only the latter were shown to be able to activate the cocultured dendritic cells (DCs). Interruption of autophagic flux via chloroquine further upregulated ectoDAMP activity and resultant DC activation. For potential clinical application, DC vaccine preparations treated with tumor cells that were already pretreated with chloroquine and shikonin further enhanced the antimetastatic activity of 4T1 tumors and reduced the effective dosage of doxorubicin. The enhanced immunogenicity and vaccine efficacy obtained via shikonin and chloroquine cotreatment of tumor cells may thus constitute a compelling strategy for developing cancer vaccines via the use of a combinational drug treatment.", "doi": "10.1080/15548627.2017.1386359", "title": "Necroptosis promotes autophagy-dependent upregulation of DAMP and results in immunosurveillance.", "journal": ["Autophagy", "Autophagy"]}
