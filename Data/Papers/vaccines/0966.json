Selected mucosal leukocytes of the conjunctiva-associated lymphoid tissue (CALT), Harderian gland (HG), nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) and trachea from 4-, 6-, 8-, and 10-week-old chickens were enumerated and phenotyped. HG, NALT, and trachea cellularity increased as the birds aged with cell viability varying by tissue. The results showed that the T cell subset numbers, but not B cell numbers, increased in the mucosal tissues of chickens during aging.", "doi": "10.1080/15321819.2017.1393435", "title": "Seeding of the mucosal leukocytes in the HALT and trachea of White Leghorn chickens.", "journal": ["Journal of immunoassay & immunochemistry", "J Immunoassay Immunochem"]}
