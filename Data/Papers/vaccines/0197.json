Further, murine mechanistic studies and studies in immunocompromised patients have documented the critical role of immunity in effectiveness of radio- and chemotherapy. However, in addition to the ability of the immune system to control cancer progression, it can also promote tumor growth, via regulatory T cells (Tregs), myeloid-derived dendritic cells (MDSCs) and tumor associated macrophages (TAM), which can enhance survival of cancer cells directly or via the regulation of the tumor stroma.An increasing body of evidence supports a central role for the tumor microenvironment (TME) and the interactions between tumor stroma, infiltrating immune cells and cancer cells during the induction and effector phase of anti-cancer immunity, and the overall effectiveness of immunotherapy and other forms of cancer treatment. In this chapter, we discuss the roles of key TME components during tumor progression, metastatic process and cancer therapy-induced tumor regression, as well as opportunities for their modulation to enhance the overall therapeutic benefit.", "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-67577-0_1", "title": "Tumor Immuno-Environment in Cancer Progression and Therapy.", "journal": ["Advances in experimental medicine and biology", "Adv.
