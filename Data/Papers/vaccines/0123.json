The analyses employed a multivariate mixed-effects model analyzing data from the National Immunization Survey, School Vaccination Assessment Reports, National Vital Statistics and National Children's Health Survey. We found that state-level childhood vaccine uptake for age appropriate vaccines was neither associated with the decline in the incidence of SIDS nor rise in the prevalence of ADHD. Our findings provide current and evidence-based information to assist providers counseling vaccine-hesitant parents.", "doi": "10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.12.065", "title": "Sudden infant death syndrome, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and vaccines: Longitudinal population analyses.", "journal": ["Vaccine", "Vaccine"]}
