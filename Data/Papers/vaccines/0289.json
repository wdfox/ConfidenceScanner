From contained, though considerable, outbreaks in the southern Indian Ocean, parts of South America and the Caribbean, CHIKV continues to be a significant pathogen in Southeast Asia and India. CHIKV circulates during epidemics through an urban mosquito-to-human transmission cycle, and with no available treatments or licensed vaccines to specifically target CHIKV disease, limiting transmission relies on vector control, which poses significant challenges, especially in developing countries. This review summarizes the current findings and progress in the development of safe, effective and affordable therapeutics and vaccines for CHIKV disease.", "doi": "10.12688/f1000research.12461.1", "title": "Chikungunya: vaccines and therapeutics.", "journal": ["F1000Research", "F1000Res"]}
