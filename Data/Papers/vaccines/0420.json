While conceptually attractive, clinical efficacy is lacking given several key challenges stemming from the similarities between cancerous and healthy tissue. Ideally, an effective vaccine formulation would deliver multiple tumor antigens in a fashion that potently stimulates endogenous immune responses against those antigens. Here, it is reported on the fabrication of a biomimetic, nanoparticulate anticancer vaccine that is capable of delivering autologously derived tumor antigen material together with a highly immunostimulatory adjuvant. The two major components, tumor antigens and adjuvant, are presented concurrently in a fashion that maximizes their ability to promote effective antigen presentation and activation of downstream immune processes. Ultimately, it is demonstrated that the formulation can elicit potent antitumor immune responses in vivo. When combined with additional immunotherapies such as checkpoint blockades, the nanovaccine demonstrates substantial therapeutic effect. Overall, the work represents the rational application of nanotechnology for immunoengineering and can provide a blueprint for the future development of personalized, autologous anticancer vaccines with broad applicability.", "doi": "10.1002/adma.201703969", "title": "Nanoparticulate Delivery of Cancer Cell Membrane Elicits Multiantigenic Antitumor Immunity.", "journal": ["Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)", "Adv.
