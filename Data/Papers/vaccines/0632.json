However, alum hardly induces T helper 1 (Th1) immune responses that are required for anti-tumor immunity. In the present study, we fabricated hierarchical copper- and zinc- buds dressing \u03b3-AlOOH mesostrands (Cu- and Zn-AMSs) with randomly wrinkled morphology, mesoscale void- or cave-like pockets, high-exposed surface coverage sites, and positive charge streams in saline. We confirmed that Cu- and Zn-AMSs promoted intracellular uptake of model cancer antigen (ovalbumin, OVA) by THP-1-differentiated macrophage-like cells in vitro. Moreover, Cu- and Zn-AMSs enhanced maturation and cytokine release of bone marrow dendritic cells in vitro. In vivo study demonstrated that Cu- and Zn-AMSs markedly induced anti-tumor-immunity and enhanced CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations in splenocytes of mice. These findings demonstrated that hierarchical copper- and zinc- buds dressing \u03b3-AlOOH mesostrands, which are oriented in randomly wrinkled matrice, are suitable platforms as novel adjuvants for cancer immunotherapy.", "doi": "10.1038/s41598-017-12446-9", "title": "Hierarchically porous, and Cu- and Zn-containing \u03b3-AlOOH mesostrands as adjuvants for cancer immunotherapy.", "journal": ["Scientific reports", "Sci Rep"]}
