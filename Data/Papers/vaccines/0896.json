While the cost can often be inferred, forward modelling of the effect of different intervention options is complicated and disease specific. Here we introduce a package that is aimed to simplify this process. The package allows one to infer parameters using a Bayesian approach, perform forward modelling of the likely results of the proposed intervention and finally perform cost effectiveness analysis of the results. The package is based on a method previously used in the United Kingdom to inform vaccination strategies for influenza, with extensions to make it easily adaptable to other diseases and data sources.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005838", "title": "fluEvidenceSynthesis: An R package for evidence synthesis based analysis of epidemiological outbreaks.", "journal": ["PLoS computational biology", "PLoS Comput.
