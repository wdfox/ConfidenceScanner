Due to their specific function, CD8+ T cells with cytolytic activity (CTL) have attracted the attention of most investigators because CTL are considered the main effectors against tumor cells. Nevertheless, CTL activity and persistence is largely dependent on the action of CD4+ T helper cells (TH). Thus establishment of tumor-specific TH cell response is key to the optimal response against cancer. Here we describe emerging new strategies to increase the TH cell recognition of tumor antigens. In particular, we review recent data indicating that tumor cells themselves can act as surrogate antigen presenting cells for triggering TH response and how these findings can help in constructing immunotherapeutic protocols for anti-cancer vaccine development.", "doi": "10.1080/2162402X.2017.1356149", "title": "Tumor Immunology meets\u2026Immunology: Modified cancer cells as professional APC for priming na\u00efve tumor-specific CD4+ T cells.", "journal": ["Oncoimmunology", "Oncoimmunology"]}
