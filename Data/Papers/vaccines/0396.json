Research efforts focused on vaccines against these bacteria are in pre-clinical stages, with no approved formulations currently on the market.Several live attenuated and subunit vaccine formulations have been evaluated in animal studies, with no reports of significant long term survival after lethal challenge.This review encompasses the most current vaccine strategies to prevent B. pseudomallei and B. mallei infections while providing insight for successful vaccines moving forward.", "doi": "10.1007/s40475-017-0121-7", "title": "Vaccines for the Prevention of Melioidosis and Glanders.", "journal": ["Current tropical medicine reports", "Curr Trop Med Rep"]}
