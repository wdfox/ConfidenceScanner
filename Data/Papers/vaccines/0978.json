Childhood vaccine coverage and immune response were compared between PHIV and HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU) children in Latin America and the Caribbean.PHIV and HEU children were enrolled prospectively at fifteen sites from 2002-2009. Full vaccination by age four years was defined as: three hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine doses; four tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine doses; three doses of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine by age 12 months or \u22651 dose given after age 12 months; one measles-containing vaccine dose; one rubella-containing vaccine dose. Immunity was defined by serum antibody titer. Fisher's exact test (for categorical measures) and t-test (for continuous measures) were used for comparisons.Among 519 children seen at age four years, 191 had serum specimens available (137 PHIV, 54 HEU). Among those with specimens available, 29.3% initiated combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) <12 months of age, 30.9% initiated at \u226512 months of age, and 39.8% had not received cART by the time they were seen at four years of age.At four years of age, 59.9% were on PI-containing cART (cART/PI), and 20.4% were on no ARV. PHIV children were less likely than HEU children to be fully vaccinated for tetanus (55.5% vs. 77.8%, p=0.005) and measles and rubella (both 70.1% vs. 94.4%, p<0.001). Among those fully vaccinated, immunity was significantly lower among PHIV than HEU for all vaccines examined: 20.9% vs. 37.8% for HBV (p=0.04), 72.0% vs. 90.5% for tetanus (p=0.02), 51.4% vs. 68.8% for Hib (p=0.05), 80.2% vs. 100% for measles (p<0.001) and 72.9% vs. 98.0% for rubella (p<0.001) vaccine, respectively.Compared to HEU, PHIV children were significantly less likely to be immune to vaccine-preventable diseases when fully vaccinated. Strategies to increase immunity against vaccine-preventable diseases among PHIV require further study.", "doi": "10.1097/INF.0000000000001831", "title": "Immunity Following Childhood Vaccinations in Perinatally HIV-Exposed Children with and without HIV Infection in Latin America.", "journal": ["The Pediatric infectious disease journal", "Pediatr.
