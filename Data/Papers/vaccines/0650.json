It induced much stronger specific IgG immune responses in mice than the non-mannosylated reference vaccine. Mannose coupling also led to increased numbers of macrophages, dendritic cells, and CD4+ T cells in the local lymph organs. Comparison of di- and tetravalent mannose ligands revealed an increased binding of the tetravalent version, suggesting that higher valency improves binding to the mannose receptor. The mannose-coupled vaccine and the non-mannosylated reference vaccine induced IgG antibodies that exhibited similar binding to human breast tumor cells.", "doi": "10.1002/cmdc.201700646", "title": "A Synthetic MUC1 Anticancer Vaccine Containing Mannose Ligands for Targeting Macrophages and Dendritic Cells.", "journal": ["ChemMedChem", "ChemMedChem"]}
