During the first week, BCG had a marked beneficial effect for boys reducing mortality three-fold (MRR (BCG/no BCG)=0.36 (0.20-0.67)). In weeks 2-4 the effect waned for boys (MRR=0.91 (0.51-1.69)). In girls the pattern was opposite with a limited effect in the first week (MRR=0.85 (0.46-1.54)), but a significant reduction in weeks 2-4 (MRR=0.56 (0.31-1.00)). This pattern was consistent in all three trials. The verbal autopsies linked the early benefit to fewer sepsis-related deaths among BCG-vaccinated boys.The marked reduction in mortality in the first few days after BCG vaccination in boys emphasizes the importance of providing BCG as soon as possible after birth.ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00146302) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00625482).", "doi": "10.1093/infdis/jix612", "title": "Rapid protective effects of early BCG on neonatal mortality among low birth weight boys: observations from randomised trials.", "journal": ["The Journal of infectious diseases", "J.
