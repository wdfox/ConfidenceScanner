In this study, we calculated the proportion of children aged 12-48 months who were fully vaccinated, under-vaccinated, or who had not received any vaccines. Childhood, household, and sociocultural factors associated with under-vaccination and non-vaccination were evaluated. Methods Using data from India's 4th District-level Health and Facility Survey, 2012-2013 (DLHS-4) and the 2012-2013 Annual Health Survey (AHS), we calculated the proportion of children who were non-vaccinated, under-vaccinated, or fully vaccinated with 1 dose of Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin, 3 doses of oral polio vaccine, 3 doses of diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus, and 1 dose of measles-containing vaccine. The odds of full vaccination compared to non-vaccination and under-vaccination relative to various factors was assessed using a multivariable, multinomial logistic regression which accounted for survey design. Results Of 1,929,580 children aged 12-48 months, 59% were fully vaccinated, 34% were under-vaccinated, and 7% were non-vaccinated. Compared to children born in government institutions, children delivered in non-institutional settings with a skilled birth attendant present had higher odds of non-vaccination (OR 1.66) and those without a skilled attendant present had still greater odds of non-vaccination (OR 2.39) and under-vaccination (OR 1.11). Conclusions for Practice India's vaccination rates among children aged 12-48 months remains unacceptably low. The Indian government should encourage institutional delivery or birthing with a skilled attendant to ensure women receive adequate health education through antenatal care that includes the importance of childhood vaccination.", "doi": "10.1007/s10995-017-2409-6", "title": "Factors Associated with Vaccination Status of Children Aged 12-48 Months in India, 2012-2013.", "journal": ["Maternal and child health journal", "Matern Child Health J"]}
