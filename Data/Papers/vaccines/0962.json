We present a case involving the new onset of MG, in which the symptoms started shortly after intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) for bladder cancer.A 69-year-old male with bladder cancer developed ptosis and diplopia 4 days after the completion of a treatment regimen with intravesical BCG weekly for 6 weeks.Ocular MG was confirmed by a positive serum anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody test.Treatment with high-dose methylprednisolone pulse therapy was given, after insufficient treatment with pyridostigmine bromide and 10\u200amg/d prednisolone.Symptoms resolved completely 12 days after high-dose methylprednisolone pulse therapy.Intravesical BCG could be listed as a novel drug that may induce a new onset of MG along with drugs such as D-penicillamine and immune checkpoint inhibitors.", "doi": "10.1097/MD.0000000000008757", "title": "New onset of myasthenia gravis after intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin: A case report and literature review.", "journal": ["Medicine", "Medicine (Baltimore)"]}
