The rapid evolution of new sub-lineages is currently the greatest challenge in vaccine development. In this study, we developed an epitope modified non-pathogenic H5N3 (A/duck/Singapore/97) vaccine for broad protection against influenza H5 subtype. H5N3 hemagglutinin (HA) mutant reassortant viruses with A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) backbone were generated by mutating amino acids at the 140th loop and 190th \u03b1-helix of hemagglutinin. The cross-neutralizing efficacy of reverse genetics-derived H5N3HA (RG-H5N3HA) mutants was confirmed by testing reactivity with reference chicken anti-H5N1 clade 2 virus sera. Furthermore, RG-H5N3HA mutant immunized mice induced cross-neutralizing antibodies and cross-protection against distinct H5N1 viral infection. Our findings suggest that the use of non-pathogenic H5 viruses antigenically related to HPAI-H5N1 allows for the development of broadly protective vaccines and reduces the need for biosafety level 3 (BSL3) containment facilities.", "doi": "10.3390/v10010002", "title": "Broadening the H5N3 Vaccine Immunogenicity against H5N1 Virus by Modification of Neutralizing Epitopes.", "journal": ["Viruses", "Viruses"]}
