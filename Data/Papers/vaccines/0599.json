To investigate the potential synergism in anti-tumoral efficacy of oncolytic and vaccine properties, we chose Ovalbumin and an ideal tumor antigen, claudin-6, for pre-clinical proof of concept. To enhance immunogenicity, both antigens were presented by retroviral virus-like particle produced in situ during MV-infection. All recombinant MV revealed normal growths, genetic stability, and proper expression and presentation of both antigens. Potent antigen-specific humoral and cellular immunity were found in immunized MV-susceptible IFNAR-/--CD46Ge mice. These immune responses significantly inhibited metastasis formation or increased therapeutic efficacy compared to control MV in respective novel in vivo tumor models using syngeneic B16-hCD46/mCLDN6 murine melanoma cells. These data indicate the potential of MV to trigger selected tumor\u00a0antigen-specific immune responses on top of direct tumor lysis for enhanced efficacy.", "doi": "10.1038/s41598-017-16928-8", "title": "Antigen-specific oncolytic MV-based tumor vaccines through presentation of selected tumor-associated antigens on infected cells or virus-like particles.", "journal": ["Scientific reports", "Sci Rep"]}
