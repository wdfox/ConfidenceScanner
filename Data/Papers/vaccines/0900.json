Blockade of the key proinflammatory cytokine IL-1\u03b2 has been implicated as a promising therapeutic strategy for the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes. In this study, we developed an IL-1\u03b2-targeted therapeutic vaccine consisting of an IL-1\u03b2 epitope peptide (A1\u03b2) and assessed its efficacy on a diabetic KK-Ay mouse model.KK-Ay mice were immunized with A1\u03b2 for three injections at a 2-week interval. The induced antibody titers, body weights and blood glucose levels were monitored every two weeks. Then the intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test and insulin tolerance test were performed. The \u03b2-cell mass, \u03b2-cell apoptosis and proliferation were evaluated by immunofluorescence. IL-1\u03b2 gene expression in islets was also measured by quantitative RT-PCR.A1\u03b2 immunization induced robust antibody responses, reduced body weight gain, improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in KK-Ay mice. Moreover, A1\u03b2 restored \u03b2-cell mass, inhibited \u03b2-cell apoptosis, enhanced \u03b2-cell proliferation and downregulated IL-1\u03b2 expression.The novel IL-1\u03b2-targeted epitope vaccine has the therapeutic potential for T2DM.", "doi": "10.1016/j.lfs.2017.11.021", "title": "Therapeutic vaccine against IL-1\u03b2 improved glucose control in a mouse model of type 2 diabetes.", "journal": ["Life sciences", "Life Sci."]}
