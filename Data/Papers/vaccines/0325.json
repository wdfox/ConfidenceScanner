However, each vaccine is essentially a single-use, patient-specific product, making this approach resource-intensive. For this reason, it is important to ask whether this approach will be any more successful than what has been attempted during the last 30 years using vaccines targeting self-epitopes. Here, we discuss what might be expected from neoantigen vaccines based on our experience in chronic viral infections, and how this new approach may be applied to cancer immunotherapy.", "doi": "10.1101/cshperspect.a033704", "title": "Is It Possible to Develop Cancer Vaccines to Neoantigens, What Are the Major Challenges, and How Can These Be Overcome?
