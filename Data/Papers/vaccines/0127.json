We further sought to reveal underlying mechanisms by identifying the responsible receptor and cellular target of 17,18-EpETE.Contact hypersensitivity was induced by topical application of 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene. Skin inflammation and immune cell populations were analyzed by flow cytometric, immunohistologic and quantitative RT-PCR analyses. Neutrophil mobility was examined by imaging analysis in vivo and neutrophil culture in vitro. The receptor for 17,18-EpETE was identified by using the TGF\u03b1-shedding assay and receptor's involvement in the anti-inflammatory effects of 17,18-EpETE was examined by using KO mice and specific inhibitor treatment.We found that preventive or therapeutic treatment with 17,18-EpETE ameliorated contact hypersensitivity by inhibiting neutrophil mobility in mice and cynomolgus macaques. 17,18-EpETE was recognized by GPR40 (also known as free fatty acid receptor 1) and inhibited chemoattractant-induced Rac activation and pseudopod formation in neutrophils. Indeed, the anti-allergic inflammatory effect of 17,18-EpETE was abolished in the absence or inhibition of GPR40.17,18-EpETE inhibits neutrophil mobility through the activation of GPR40, which is a potential therapeutic target to control allergic inflammatory diseases.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jaci.2017.09.053", "title": "17,18-EpETE-GPR40 axis ameliorates contact hypersensitivity by inhibiting neutrophil mobility in mice and cynomolgus macaques.", "journal": ["The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology", "J.
