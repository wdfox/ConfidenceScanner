Risk factors for missed opportunity (MO) for simultaneous administration of MCV2 were also investigated.Children born from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2014 and registered in Zhejiang provincial immunization information system were enrolled in this study. The MO of simultaneous administration of MCV2, the actual age-appropriate coverage (AAC) of MCV2 and the potentially achievable coverage (PAC) of MCV2 were evaluated and compared across different birth cohorts, by different socio-demographic variables. For the 2014 birth cohort, logistic regression model was used to detect the risk factors of MOs, from both socio-demographic and vaccination service providing aspects.Compared to the AAC, the PAC of MCV2 increased significantly from 2005 birth cohort to 2014 birth cohort (p<0.001), with a median of 12.7 percentage points. Higher birth order of children, resident children, higher maternal education background, higher socio-economic development level of resident areas, less frequent vaccination service, and shorter vaccination service time were significant risk factors of MO for simultaneous administration of MCV2, with all p-value < 0.05.The findings in this study suggest that fully utilization of all opportunities for simultaneous administration of all age-eligible vaccine doses at the same vaccination visit is critical for achieving the coverage target of 95% for MCV2. Future interventions focusing on the group with risk factors observed could substantially eliminate MOs for simultaneous administration of MCV2, further to improve the coverage of fully immunization of MCV, and finally achieve the goal of eliminating measles.", "doi": "10.1080/21645515.2017.1419111", "title": "Evaluation of potentially achievable vaccination coverage of the second dose of measles containing vaccine with simultaneous administration and risk factors for missed opportunities among children in Zhejiang province, east China.", "journal": ["Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics", "Hum Vaccin Immunother"]}
