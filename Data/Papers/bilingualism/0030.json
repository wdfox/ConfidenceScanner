We examined six German-speaking and 11 Turkish-speaking IWA using picture-pointing tasks. Findings from our experiments show that the Turkish IWA responded more accurately to both object who and object which questions than to subject questions, while the German IWA performed better for subject which questions than in all other conditions. Using random forest models, a machine learning technique used in tree-structured classification, on the individual data revealed that both the Turkish and German IWA's response accuracy is largely predicted by the presence of overt and unambiguous case marking. We discuss our results with regard to different theoretical approaches to the comprehension of wh-questions in aphasia.", "doi": "10.1080/02643294.2017.1394284", "title": "Predicting the sources of impaired wh-question comprehension in non-fluent aphasia: A cross-linguistic machine learning study on Turkish and German.", "journal": ["Cognitive neuropsychology", "Cogn Neuropsychol"]}
