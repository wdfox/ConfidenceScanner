For Reliable Digit Span, the failure rates for Spanish (46%) and English (31%) languages of administration did not differ significantly.Optimal/suboptimal effort cut scores derived for monolingual English-speakers can be used with Spanish/English bilinguals when using the visual-perceptual format Test of Memory Malingering and Dot Counting. The high failure rate for Reliable Digit Span suggests it should not be used as a performance validity measure with Spanish/English bilinguals, irrespective of the language of test administration, Spanish or English.", "doi": "10.1080/13854046.2016.1277786", "title": "Specificity rates for non-clinical, bilingual, Mexican Americans on three popular performance validity measures.", "journal": ["The Clinical neuropsychologist", "Clin Neuropsychol"]}
