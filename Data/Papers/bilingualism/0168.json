The majority of the students in the Western Highlands speak a Mayan language as their mother tongue, yet they are generally taught in Spanish. We assisted in the development and implementation of a bilingual/intercultural education model including teacher training at the university level and bilingual materials development. Implementation included education for administrators and teacher coaching. For this intervention, aimed at improving reading outcomes, we report data for the first 3 years of implementation, and offer insights for system-wide interventions in low-resource areas.", "doi": "10.1002/cad.20191", "title": "Impact of Teachers' Practices on Students' Reading Comprehension Growth in Guatemala.", "journal": ["New directions for child and adolescent development", "New Dir Child Adolesc Dev"]}
