The present experiment was therefore aimed at investigating how late proficient Polish (L1)-English (L2) bilinguals process emotionally-laden narratives presented in L1 and L2, in the visual and auditory modality. To this aim, we employed the galvanic skin response (GSR) method and a self-report measure (Polish adaptation of the PANAS questionnaire). The GSR findings showed a reduced galvanic skin response to L2 relative to L1, thus suggesting a decreased reactivity to emotional stimuli in L2. Additionally, we observed a more pronounced skin conductance level to visual than auditory stimuli, yet only in L1, which might be accounted for by a self-reference effect that may have been modulated by both language and modality.", "doi": "10.1007/s10936-017-9552-5", "title": "On Modality Effects in Bilingual Emotional Language Processing: Evidence from Galvanic Skin Response.", "journal": ["Journal of psycholinguistic research", "J Psycholinguist Res"]}
