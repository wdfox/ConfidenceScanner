Mean spectral energy (MSE) and spectral tilt (ST) obtained from long-term average speech spectra were extracted from continuous speech samples of Farsi-Qashqai bilingual speakers. MSE and ST were calculated using Praat and then compared between Farsi and Turkish.Results showed that bilingual speakers had higher MSE and lower ST in Farsi than in Turkish.Findings show that even with the same phonatory apparatus, spoken language affects the speaker's voice quality.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jvoice.2016.07.020", "title": "The Impact of Language on Voice: An LTAS Study.", "journal": ["Journal of voice : official journal of the Voice Foundation", "J Voice"]}
