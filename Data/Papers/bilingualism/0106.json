This practice may promote SDM in that the decisions are treated as contingent on patient preferences. However, the way these hypotheses are formulated, simultaneously constrains the patient's freedom of choice and exerts a pressure to accept the physician's recommendation. These opposing effects may in part explain cases where different assessment instruments yield large variations in SDM measures.Eliciting patient preferences is a complex phenomenon that can be difficult to reduce into an accurate number. Detailed analysis can shed light on how patient preferences are elicited, and its consequences for patient involvement. Comparing CA and SDM measurements can contribute to specifying communicative actions that SDM scores are based on.Our findings have implications for SDM communication skills training and further development of SDM measurements.", "doi": "10.1016/j.pec.2017.05.018", "title": "Eliciting patient preferences in shared decision-making (SDM): Comparing conversation analysis and SDM measurements.", "journal": ["Patient education and counseling", "Patient Educ Couns"]}
