First, preverbal infants tune into word-action and word-object pairings using domain-general mechanisms. Second, while post-verbal infants from noun-friendly language environments experience verb-action mapping difficulty, infants from verb-friendly language environments do not. Third, children use language-specific conventions to learn all types of words, although still strongly influenced by their language environment. Additionally, the authors suggest neurophysiological research to advance these lines of evidence beyond traditional views of word learning.", "doi": "10.1080/87565641.2016.1243112", "title": "Early Verb-Action and Noun-Object Mapping Across Sensory Modalities: A Neuro-Developmental View.", "journal": ["Developmental neuropsychology", "Dev Neuropsychol"]}
