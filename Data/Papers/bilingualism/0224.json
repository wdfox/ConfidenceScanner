A total of 166 respondents completed an electronic survey.Results indicated that the majority of respondents have performed bilingual language assessments. Furthermore, the most frequently used informal and standardized assessments were identified. SLPs identified supports, and barriers to assessment, as well as their perceptions of graduate preparation.The findings of this study demonstrated that although SLPs have become more compliant to ASHA and IDEA guidelines, there is room for improvement in terms of adequate training in bilingual language assessment.", "doi": "10.1044/2016_LSHSS-15-0090", "title": "Bilingual Language Assessment: Contemporary Versus Recommended Practice in American Schools.", "journal": ["Language, speech, and hearing services in schools", "Lang Speech Hear Serv Sch"]}
