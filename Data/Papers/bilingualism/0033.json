Currently, in some nations across the world, there is decreasing interest in cross-cultural interactions and a new interest in nationalism and assimilation, in communication within frontiers and in a specific medium: the national language. Speech-language pathologists (SLPs) advocate for individuals with communication disorders that interfere with their comprehension and expression. The profession promotes communication as a human right. Unfortunately, many clients and their families continue to report instances in which we, SLPs, limit their human right of expression by ignoring their home languages and recommending the exclusive use of the national language. Real progress requires reflection and action on language policy. In 1998, Californians passed Proposition 227, which eliminated bilingual public education. Then, in 2016, California voters approved Proposition 58 allowing the creation of multilingual and biliteracy programs. A discussion about the presentation of these two propositions to the public may hopefully help bilingual SLPs and advocates protect our multilingual clients' human right of expression in these times of anxiety.", "doi": "10.1080/17549507.2018.1392610", "title": "Bilingualism, a human right in times of anxiety: Lessons from California.", "journal": ["International journal of speech-language pathology", "Int J Speech Lang Pathol"]}
