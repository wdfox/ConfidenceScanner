This uncertainty has led to a number of studies for which no performance difference between monolingual and bilingual adults has been detected. One approach to clarifying these issues comes from research with children showing that bilinguals were more able than their monolingual peers to perceive both interpretations of an ambiguous figure, an ability that is more tied to a conception of selective attention than to specific components of executive function. The present study extends this notion to adults by assessing their ability to see the alternative image in an ambiguous figure. Bilinguals performed this task more efficiently than monolinguals by requiring fewer cues to identify the second image. This finding has implications for the role of selective attention in performance differences between monolinguals and bilinguals.", "doi": "10.1080/17470218.2016.1221435", "title": "The relationship between bilingualism and selective attention in young adults: Evidence from an ambiguous figures task.", "journal": ["Quarterly journal of experimental psychology (2006)", "Q J Exp Psychol (Hove)"]}
