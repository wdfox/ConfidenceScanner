The current study focuses on exploring and comparing lexical performances of typically developing Lebanese bilingual children (32 Bi-TD, aged 5;7 to 6;9) and those with specific language impairment (10 Bi-SLI, aged 5;9 to 7;10), using Cross-Linguistic Lexical Tasks (LITMUS-CLT, COST Action IS0804, 2011) in Lebanese Arabic language (CLT-LB), specific to the Lebanese context. The results confirm that typically developing children have better lexical skills, especially expressive skills, than their peers with specific language impairment. Expressive and receptive performance by both groups of children was found to depend on word class (nouns and verbs). Bi-TD children were more accurate at naming and recognising verbs than the Bi-SLI group. The results of these lexical tasks reveal aspects of the nature of bilingual lexical variation, as well as similarities and differences between the Bi-TD and Bi-SLI groups.", "doi": "10.1080/02699206.2017.1308554", "title": "Assessing Lebanese bilingual children: The use of Cross-linguistic Lexical Tasks in Lebanese Arabic.", "journal": ["Clinical linguistics & phonetics", "Clin Linguist Phon"]}
