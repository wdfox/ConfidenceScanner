Moreover, their overall framework is that there is no evidence for any cognitive differences between monolingual and bilingual young adults. Here, we provide evidence in support of our original interpretation and challenge their basis for arguing that there are no language group differences on these cognitive measures.", "doi": "10.1016/j.cognition.2017.10.019", "title": "Science does not disengage.", "journal": ["Cognition", "Cognition"]}
