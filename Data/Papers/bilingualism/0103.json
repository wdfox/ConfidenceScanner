Completion time and error patterns also were examined by validity group and cognitive impairment status.This cross-sectional study included 77 veterans who completed the DCT during clinical evaluation. Seventy-four percent (N\u00a0=\u00a057) were classified as valid and 26% as noncredible (N\u00a0=\u00a020) via the Word Memory Test (WMT) and Test of Memory Malingering (TOMM). Among valid participants, 47% (N\u00a0=\u00a027) were cognitively impaired, and 53% (N\u00a0=\u00a030) were unimpaired.DCT performance was not significantly associated with age, education, or bilingualism. Seventy-five percent of the overall sample committed at least one error across the 12 stimulus cards; however, valid participants had a 27% higher rate of 0 errors, while noncredible participants had a 35% higher rate of \u22654 errors. Overall, noncredible individuals had significantly longer completion times, more errors, and higher E-scores. Conversely, those with cognitive impairment had longer completion times, but comparable errors to their unimpaired counterparts. Finally, DCT E-scores significantly predicted group membership with 83.1% classification accuracy and an area under the curve of .87 for identifying invalid performance. The optimal cut-score of 15 was associated with 70% sensitivity and 88% specificity.The DCT demonstrated good classification accuracy and sensitivity/specificity for identifying noncredible performance in this mixed clinical veteran sample, suggesting utility as a non-memory-based PVT with this population. Moreover, cognitive impairment significantly contributed to slower completion times, but not reduced accuracy.", "doi": "10.1080/13803395.2017.1342773", "title": "The Dot Counting Test adds up: Validation and response pattern analysis in a mixed clinical veteran sample.", "journal": ["Journal of clinical and experimental neuropsychology", "J Clin Exp Neuropsychol"]}
