Thus, this study investigated the left-hemispheric distribution of the L1 and L2 using repetitive navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), in combination with an object-naming task, in 10 healthy, right-handed volunteers. In particular, higher error rates (ERs) were observed in the L1, and there was a statistically significant difference between the ERs of L1 and L2 for no-response errors (L1 mean 11.9\u00b19.0%, L2 mean 6.5\u00b15.2%; p=0.03). Furthermore, language-specific and shared cortical distribution patterns for the L1 and L2 were observed within the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes with a trend towards higher occurrence of language-specific spots within posterior regions. Overall, the L1 presented a more stable pattern of language distribution compared to the L2.", "doi": "10.1016/j.bandl.2017.01.011", "title": "Identifying cortical first and second language sites via navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation of the left hemisphere in bilinguals.", "journal": ["Brain and language", "Brain Lang"]}
