Nonetheless, early ASL-English bilinguals retrieved fewer words in a letter fluency task in their dominant language compared to monolingual English speakers with equal vocabulary level. This finding demonstrates that reduced vocabulary size and/or frequency of use cannot completely account for bilingual disadvantages in verbal fluency. Instead, retrieval difficulties likely reflect between-language interference. Furthermore, it suggests that the two languages of bilinguals compete for selection even when they are expressed with distinct articulators.", "doi": "10.1017/S1366728916000596", "title": "Evidence for a bimodal bilingual disadvantage in letter fluency.", "journal": ["Bilingualism (Cambridge, England)", "Biling (Camb Engl)"]}
