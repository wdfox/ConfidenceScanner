In a computational simulation, we showed that the patterns of change in PAL scores are actually predicted by the models that formalize the associative learning process in other areas of behavioral and neuroscientific research. These models also predict that manipulating language exposure can reproduce the experience-related performance differences erroneously attributed to age-related decline in age-matched adults. Consistent with this, results showed that older bilinguals outperformed native speakers in a German PAL test, an advantage that increased with age. These analyses and results show that age-related PAL performance changes reflect the predictable effects of learning on the associability of test items, and indicate that failing to control for these effects is distorting the understanding of cognitive and brain development in adulthood.", "doi": "10.1177/0956797617706393", "title": "The Mismeasurement of Mind: Life-Span Changes in Paired-Associate-Learning Scores Reflect the \"Cost\" of Learning, Not Cognitive Decline.", "journal": ["Psychological science", "Psychol Sci"]}
