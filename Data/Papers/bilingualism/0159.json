While listeners with little experience with English classified target voicing with an English- or Spanish-like voice onset time (VOT) boundary, predicted by contextual VOT, listeners familiar with English relied on an English-like VOT boundary in an English-accented Spanish context even in the absence of clear contextual cues to English VOT. This indicates that Spanish listeners accommodated English-accented Spanish voicing differently depending on their degree of familiarization with the English norm.", "doi": "10.1177/0023830915623579", "title": "The Effects of Language Experience and Speech Context on the Phonetic Accommodation of English-accented Spanish Voicing.", "journal": ["Language and speech", "Lang Speech"]}
