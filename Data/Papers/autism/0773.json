So far, however, very little research has been done on tdcs.<br/> CONCLUSION: Further research is vitally important in order to ensure the safety and efficacy of rtms and tdcs.", "journal": ["Tijdschrift voor psychiatrie", "Tijdschr Psychiatr"], "id": "29077142", "doi": null, "date": null, "authors": [["van der Meersche", "S", "S", null], ["Lemmens", "G", "G", null], ["Matton", "C", "C", null], ["Baeken", "C", "C", null]]}
