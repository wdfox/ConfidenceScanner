ASD is a phenotypically variable disorder and detailed clinical descriptions are essential to appreciate genotype-phenotype relationships. In this report, we provide a comprehensive clinical description of a child with ASD in whom a TBR1 variant was identified. We review this case in the context of the current TBR1 literature and highlight the variable spectrum of disease associated with this gene. The phenotypic information outlined within the literature is incomplete, exemplifying the limitations of massively-parallel sequencing studies with regards to clinical annotation. We suggest that future reporting of ASD variants should include standardised phenotypic descriptions.
