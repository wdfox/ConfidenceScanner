{"title": "Social skills plus relaxation training with a child with ASD in the schools.", "text": "A social skills plus relaxation training (SSRT) program was developed using direct training, relaxation training, and reinforcement principles. The aim was to examine the effectiveness of SSRT on increasing the frequency of three target behaviors for one 8-year-old, student classified with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A multiple-baseline across behaviors design was used to evaluate the effects of SSRT. During baseline, intervention, and maintenance sessions the student's responses were videotaped and then subsequently viewed and coded after the session. During intervention, the student's correct responses for the targeted social skills increased and were maintained 17 weeks after SSRT ended. This study adds support for the use of this SSRT program in a school setting with children who have ASD.", "journal": ["Research in developmental disabilities", "Res Dev Disabil"], "id": "29054024", "doi": "10.1016/j.ridd.2017.10.012", "date": "2017-10-17", "authors": [["Floress", "Margaret T", "MT", "Eastern Illinois University, 600 Lincoln Avenue, Charleston, IL 61920, USA.
