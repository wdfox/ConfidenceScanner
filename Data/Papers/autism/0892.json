{"title": "[Long-term effects of polycystic ovary syndrome on the offspring].", "text": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine disorder with reproductive dysfunction and abnormal metabolic syndrome. However, its etiology is unknown yet. Androgen hypersecretion is one of the main features of PCOS. It has been found that PCOS has various effects on the offspring in reproductive, metabolic and nervous systems, including:increasing secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone and luteinizing hormone, ovarian morphological changes and abnormal secretion of sex hormones, leading to disorders of lipid and glucose metabolism, and increasing the risks of depression and autism. However, there is still lack of direct evidence, and more studies should be conducted on the underlying mechanism in future.", "journal": ["Zhejiang da xue xue bao.
