{"title": "Systematic Review of Differential Reinforcement of Alternative Behavior Without Extinction for Individuals With Autism.", "text": "The purpose of this article is to review the literature on differential reinforcement of alternative behavior procedures without extinction for individuals with autism. Using predetermined inclusion criteria, a total of 10 studies were included and summarized in terms of the following: (a) participant characteristics (e.g., sex, age, and diagnosis), (b) treatment setting, (c) problem behavior, (d) function, (e) alternative behavior, (f) intervention, (g) outcomes, and (h) conclusiveness of evidence. Of the 10 studies, nine demonstrated positive effects and one mixed effects. Five studies successfully reduced problem behavior by manipulating different reinforcement parameters (magnitude, immediacy, and quality) and four manipulated the schedule of reinforcement. One study had mixed results with two of the three participants requiring extinction. The findings of this review suggest that variations of differential reinforcement of alternative behavior interventions without an extinction component may be considered promising practices for the treatment of challenging behavior in individuals with autism.", "journal": ["Behavior modification", "Behav Modif"], "id": "29117712", "doi": "10.1177/0145445517740321", "date": "2017-11-01", "authors": [["MacNaul", "Hannah L", "HL", "1 University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA."], ["Neely", "Leslie C", "LC", "2 The University of Texas at San Antonio, TX, USA."]]}
