{"title": "Speak Up: Increasing Conversational Volume in a Child with Autism Spectrum Disorder.", "text": "Deficits in social interactions are a hallmark of autism spectrum disorder. This study examined one relatively uncommon aspect of social interactions that has not received much attention from the literature: appropriate conversational volume. Conversational speech volume was measured using a commercially available application, and a package intervention was developed that consisted of feedback from the voice measuring application, signaling from a wrist bracelet, and differential reinforcement. The intervention was evaluated in an ABAB design and speaking at conversational volume was significantly increased when the intervention was in place and in probe conditions.", "journal": ["Behavior analysis in practice", "Behav Anal Pract"], "id": "29214137", "doi": "10.1007/s40617-016-0168-2", "date": "2017-01-11", "authors": [["Edgerton", "Leigh", "L", "Virginia Institute of Autism, Charlottesville, USA."], ["Wine", "Byron", "B", "Florida Institute of Technology, 1701 Byrd Ave., Richmond, VA 23230 USA."]]}
