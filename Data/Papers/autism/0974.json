{"title": "Brief Report: Self-Reported Academic, Social, and Mental Health Experiences of Post-Secondary Students with Autism Spectrum Disorder.", "text": "Increasing numbers of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are enrolling in post-secondary academic institutions. However, research indicates that post-secondary students with ASD are struggling more than their typically developing peers, with high rates of loneliness, anxiety, depression, and an increased incidence of dropping-out before completion of their degrees. The current study utilized an online survey to gain insight into the self-reported academic, social, and mental health experiences of post-secondary students with ASD. Participants reported high levels of academic comfort, but struggled with issues of isolation/loneliness and high levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. Of greatest concern, were the nearly three-quarters of participants who reported lifetime suicidal behaviors. Further analysis on collected data and implications of findings are discussed.", "journal": ["Journal of autism and developmental disorders", "J Autism Dev Disord"], "id": "29022149", "doi": "10.1007/s10803-017-3315-x", "date": "2017-10-11", "authors": [["Jackson", "Scott L J", "SLJ", "Child Study Center, School of Medicine, Yale University, 230 South Frontage Road, New Haven, CT, 06520, USA. scott.jackson@yale.edu."], ["Hart", "Logan", "L", "Child Study Center, School of Medicine, Yale University, 230 South Frontage Road, New Haven, CT, 06520, USA."], ["Brown", "Jane Thierfeld", "JT", "Child Study Center, School of Medicine, Yale University, 230 South Frontage Road, New Haven, CT, 06520, USA."], ["Volkmar", "Fred R", "FR", "Child Study Center, School of Medicine, Yale University, 230 South Frontage Road, New Haven, CT, 06520, USA."]]}
