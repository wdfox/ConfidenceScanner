{"title": "Effects of minocycline and doxycycline against terbutaline induced early postnatal autistic changes in albino rats.", "text": "The current study was initiated to explicate the shielding response of minocycline and doxycycline against early postnatal neurological damage and behavioral alteration convinced by terbutaline. Toxicity was induced by terbutaline at three successive days in the pups. The pups were scrutinized for behavioral, biochemical and inflammatory markers. Subsequent treatment with test drugs commenced a favorable effect on the autistic symptoms with more safeguard by doxycycline. The study also recognized peripheral inflammatory reactions and increased nitric oxide (NO) through terbutaline which was curtailed down by test drugs, with the much more noticeable effect of doxycycline. The GC-FID analysis and histopathological evaluation of the brain tissue elicited more pronounced protection by doxycycline. Doxycycline was also evident with remarkable down-regulation Pgp 9.5 [Ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL-1)] expression in the brain tissue in comparison to minocycline.", "journal": ["Physiology & behavior", "Physiol.
