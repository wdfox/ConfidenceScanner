{"title": "Array-CGH Analysis in a Cohort of Phenotypically Well-Characterized Individuals with \"Essential\" Autism Spectrum Disorders.", "text": "Copy-number variants (CNVs) are associated with susceptibility to autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To detect the presence of CNVs, we conducted an array-comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) analysis in 133 children with \"essential\" ASD phenotype. Genetic analyses documented that 12 children had causative CNVs (C-CNVs), 29 children had non-causative CNVs (NC-CNVs) and 92 children without CNVs (W-CNVs). Results on clinical evaluation showed no differences in cognitive abilities among the three groups, and a higher number of ASD symptoms and of non-verbal children in the C-CNVs group compared to the W-CNVs and NC-CNVs groups. Our results highlighted the importance of the array-CGH analyses and showed that the presence of specific CNVs may differentiate clinical outputs in children with ASD.", "journal": ["Journal of autism and developmental disorders", "J Autism Dev Disord"], "id": "29027068", "doi": "10.1007/s10803-017-3329-4", "date": "2017-10-12", "authors": [["Napoli", "Eleonora", "E", "Department of Neurosciences, Child Neuropsychiatry Unit, Bambino Ges\u00f9 Children's Hospital, IRCCS, Rome, Italy."], ["Russo", "Serena", "S", "Laboratory of Medical Genetics, Bambino Ges\u00f9 Children's Hospital, IRCCS, Rome, Italy."], ["Casula", "Laura", "L", "Department of Neurosciences, Child Neuropsychiatry Unit, Bambino Ges\u00f9 Children's Hospital, IRCCS, Rome, Italy."], ["Alesi", "Viola", "V", "Laboratory of Medical Genetics, Bambino Ges\u00f9 Children's Hospital, IRCCS, Rome, Italy."], ["Amendola", "Filomena Alessandra", "FA", "Department of Neurosciences, Child Neuropsychiatry Unit, Bambino Ges\u00f9 Children's Hospital, IRCCS, Rome, Italy."], ["Angioni", "Adriano", "A", "Laboratory of Medical Genetics, Bambino Ges\u00f9 Children's Hospital, IRCCS, Rome, Italy."], ["Novelli", "Antonio", "A", "Laboratory of Medical Genetics, Bambino Ges\u00f9 Children's Hospital, IRCCS, Rome, Italy."], ["Valeri", "Giovanni", "G", "Department of Neurosciences, Child Neuropsychiatry Unit, Bambino Ges\u00f9 Children's Hospital, IRCCS, Rome, Italy."], ["Menghini", "Deny", "D", "Department of Neurosciences, Child Neuropsychiatry Unit, Bambino Ges\u00f9 Children's Hospital, IRCCS, Rome, Italy."], ["Vicari", "Stefano", "S", "Department of Neurosciences, Child Neuropsychiatry Unit, Bambino Ges\u00f9 Children's Hospital, IRCCS, Rome, Italy. stefano.vicari@opbg.net."]]}
