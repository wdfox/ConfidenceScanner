In addition to reviewing previous reports of psychotic symptoms in persons with WS, this paper introduces clinical histories and therapeutic management strategies for three previously unreported adults with WS diagnosed with co-morbid MDD with psychotic features. Co-morbid medical disorders common in WS are highlighted with regard to safe and appropriate pharmacological treatment. The importance of assessment for co-morbid MDD with psychotic features in individuals with WS is emphasized.", "journal": ["Journal of autism and developmental disorders", "J Autism Dev Disord"], "id": "29164439", "doi": "10.1007/s10803-017-3384-x", "date": "2017-11-21", "authors": [["Valdes", "Francisca", "F", "University of Chile, Santiago, Chile."], ["Keary", "Christopher J", "CJ", "Lurie Center for Autism, Massachusetts General Hospital, One Maguire Road, Lexington, MA, 02421-3114, USA."], ["Mullett", "Jennifer E", "JE", "Lurie Center for Autism, Massachusetts General Hospital, One Maguire Road, Lexington, MA, 02421-3114, USA."], ["Palumbo", "Michelle L", "ML", "Lurie Center for Autism, Massachusetts General Hospital, One Maguire Road, Lexington, MA, 02421-3114, USA."], ["Waxler", "Jessica L", "JL", "Department of Pediatrics, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."], ["Pober", "Barbara R", "BR", "Department of Pediatrics, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."], ["McDougle", "Christopher J", "CJ", "Lurie Center for Autism, Massachusetts General Hospital, One Maguire Road, Lexington, MA, 02421-3114, USA. cmcdougle@mgh.harvard.edu."]]}
