{"title": "[Social Cognition and its Contribution to the Rehabilitation of Behavioural Disorders in Traumatic Brain Injury].", "text": "Social behaviour disorders in traumatic brain injury are caused by the dysfunction of cognitive processes involved in social and interpersonal interaction. The concept of social cognition was introduced by authors studying schizophrenia, autism or mental retardation. The boundaries and the content of the concept have not yet been definitively defined, but theory of mind, empathy and emotional processing are included in all the models proposed. The strategies proposed to improve social behaviour focus on the restoration of cognitive processes such as working memory, emotional recognition and processing, and empathy, as well as social skills. To date, there is very little evidence on the efficacy of the aforementioned social cognition strategies.", "journal": ["Revista colombiana de psiquiatria", "Rev Colomb Psiquiatr"], "id": "29037337", "doi": "10.1016/j.rcp.2017.05.005", "date": "2017-06-17", "authors": [["Quemada", "Jos\u00e9 Ignacio", "JI", "Servicio de da\u00f1o Cerebral, Hospital Aita Menni Arrasate-Mondrag\u00f3n, Guip\u00fazcoa, Espa\u00f1a.
