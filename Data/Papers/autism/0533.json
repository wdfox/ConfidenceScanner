{"title": "The relationship of parental expressed emotion to co-occurring psychopathology in individuals with autism spectrum disorder: A systematic review.", "text": "Expressed emotion is a construct of the affective relationship between two people, with domains measuring criticism, hostility, warmth, relationship and emotional over-involvement. This review focuses on studies of Expressed Emotion in families of individuals with autism spectrum disorder and its association with co-occurring psychiatric disorders. A systematic search used the Psych-Info and Medline databases to identify articles available at or before September 2016. Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria. The included studies suggest that high levels of expressed emotion, including criticism, are associated with behavioural problems. However, the relationship between expressed emotion and emotional problems is presently unclear because findings were mixed. Also, there is presently little evidence regarding the impact of other components of expressed emotion on co-occurring disorders.", "journal": ["Research in developmental disabilities", "Res Dev Disabil"], "id": "29156388", "doi": "10.1016/j.ridd.2017.10.022", "date": "2017-11-20", "authors": [["Romero-Gonzalez", "Marina", "M", "King's College London, Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, United Kingdom.
