{"title": "Parents' Use of Complementary Health Approaches for Young Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.", "text": "Knowledge of why parents use complementary health approaches (CHA) for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is limited. We conducted a mixed methods study to better understand factors influencing parents' decision to use CHA for ASD. Parent-reported data about CHA use were collected on a probability sample of 352 young children with ASD in Denver, Colorado; Los Angeles, California; or Portland, Oregon. Follow-back interviews were conducted with 31 parents. CHA use was negatively associated with older child age and positively associated with parents' belief ASD has major consequences, living in Portland or Denver, and medication use. Nine themes help explain these results. Study findings may have utility for healthcare providers working with children with ASD and their families regarding CHA.", "journal": ["Journal of autism and developmental disorders", "J Autism Dev Disord"], "id": "29243100", "doi": "10.1007/s10803-017-3432-6", "date": "2017-12-14", "authors": [["Lindly", "Olivia J", "OJ", "Department of General Academic Pediatrics, Massachusetts General Hospital for Children and Harvard Medical School, 125 Nashua Street, Boston, MA, 02114, USA. olindly@mgh.harvard.edu."], ["Thorburn", "Sheryl", "S", "School of Social and Behavioral Health Sciences, College of Public Health and Human Sciences, Oregon State University, 401 Waldo Hall, Corvallis, OR, 97331, USA."], ["Heisler", "Karen", "K", "Childhood Health Associates of Salem, Oregan, Salem, USA."], ["Reyes", "Nuri M", "NM", "Department of Psychiatry, School of Medicine, University of Colorado, 13121 E. 17th Avenue, 5th Floor, Aurora, CO, 80045, USA."], ["Zuckerman", "Katharine E", "KE", "Division of General Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Oregon Health & Science University, 707 SW Gaines Street, Portland, OR, 97239, USA."]]}
