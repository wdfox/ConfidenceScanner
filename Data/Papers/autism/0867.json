{"title": "Risperidone in combination with other drugs: Experimental research in individuals with autism spectrum disorder.", "text": "Many individuals with autism spectrum disorder simultaneously receive 2 or more drugs intended to improve their behavior, but few studies have evaluated the effects of such polypharmacy. This article summarizes those studies that have systematically examined the effects of risperidone, an antipsychotic drug that is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat \"irritability\" in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder, in combination with another drug with respect to experimental design, assessment techniques, drug co-administered, reported effects, and participant characteristics. The drug combinations that have been evaluated do not parallel those commonly co-administered to individuals with autism spectrum disorder in the United States, and there is no compelling empirical evidence to support the practice of prescribing risperidone in combination with another drug in an attempt to benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder.
