{"title": "A Model of Family and Child Functioning in Siblings of Youth with Autism Spectrum Disorder.", "text": "The potential clinical needs of typically developing (TD) siblings of youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) remain disputed. A total of 239 mothers of youth aged 6-17, including one youth with ASD (M\u2009=\u200911.14 years; simplex families) and at least one other youth (M\u2009=\u200911.74\u00a0years) completed online standardized measures of various familial factors and TD youth outcomes. Overall, only 6-23% of siblings were identified within the clinical range of emotional, behavioral, or social functioning. Both maternal depression and sibling relationship were identified as key pathways in predicting siblings' functioning within a good-fitting path analysis model. The current model is presented as a novel base for the development of future research and services for this unique population of children.", "journal": ["Journal of autism and developmental disorders", "J Autism Dev Disord"], "id": "29067588", "doi": "10.1007/s10803-017-3352-5", "date": "2017-10-24", "authors": [["Tudor", "Megan E", "ME", "UC Davis MIND Institute, 2825 50th St, Sacramento, CA, 95817, USA. metudor@ucdavis.edu."], ["Rankin", "James", "J", "Psychology Department, University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL, USA."], ["Lerner", "Matthew D", "MD", "Psychology Department, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA."]]}
