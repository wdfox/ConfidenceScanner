Overall the quality of the evidence for each tool was limited.Validation of these instruments, or others that comprehensively assess participation, is needed. Future studies should follow recommended methodological standards.Seven instruments have been used to assess participation in young people with autism. One instrument, with excellent measurement properties in one study, does not comprehensively assess participation. Studies of three instruments that incorporate a more comprehensive assessment of participation have methodological limitations. Overall, limited evidence exists regarding measurement properties of participation assessments for young people with autism.", "doi": "10.1111/dmcn.13631", "journal": ["Developmental medicine and child neurology", "Dev Med Child Neurol"], "date": "2018-01-18_23:46:03"}
