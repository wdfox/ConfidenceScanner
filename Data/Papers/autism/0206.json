{"title": "Follow-Up Study of Youth Who Received EIBI as Young Children.", "text": "Although early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI) has been clearly shown to be evidence-based, there is very little information available regarding long-term outcomes, especially from community effectiveness studies. We present data on cognitive, adaptive, and autism severity measures from four time points (pre- and post-EIBI and two follow-up points) for a sample of 21 youth, currently aged 16 years on average (range = 13-20) who received EIBI as young children and who have been out of EIBI for a mean of 10 years (range = 8.5-14). Results show heterogeneous outcomes and a general pattern of stability since the end of EIBI, suggesting gains made in EIBI are maintained.", "journal": ["Behavior modification", "Behav Modif"], "id": "29241355", "doi": "10.1177/0145445517746916", "date": "2017-12-01", "authors": [["Perry", "Adrienne", "A", "1 York University, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."], ["Koudys", "Julie", "J", "2 Brock University, Saint Catharines, Ontario, Canada."], ["Prichard", "Alice", "A", "3 Alberta Health Services, Calgary, Alberta, Canada."], ["Ho", "Hilda", "H", "1 York University, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."]]}
