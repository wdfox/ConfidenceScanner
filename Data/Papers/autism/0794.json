{"title": "The Occurrence of Antibodies Against Gluten in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders Does Not Correlate with Serological Markers of Impaired Intestinal Permeability.", "text": "There is evidence that children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) display an increased immune reactivity against gluten, which is supposed to be the effect of intestinal barrier abnormalities. The aim of study was to evaluate the relation of antibody induced by gluten to zonulin and intestinal fatty acid binding proteins (I-FABP), that is, serological markers of an impaired gut barrier. The study included 77 patients with ASDs. Zonulin, I-FABP, celiac-specific antibodies, anti-gliadin antibodies (AGA), and antibodies against neural transglutaminase 6 (TG6) of immunoglobulin (Ig) A and IgG classes were detected in sera. Celiac-specific antibodies were negative in all ASD children, four children (5.2%) had positive anti-TG6 antibodies, and increased AGA-IgG production was found in 21 patients (27.3%). Mean levels of zonulin and I-FABP in ASD patients were similar to those found in healthy controls and revealed a negative correlation with age, whereas regression analysis revealed a significant positive relationship between antibody production and the age. Serum concentrations of zonulin and I-FABP showed no statistically significant association with antibody positivity. An increased production of antibodies related to gliadin and neural TG6 in ASD children is not related to serological markers of an impaired intestinal barrier.", "journal": ["Journal of medicinal food", "J Med Food"], "id": "29072974", "doi": "10.1089/jmf.2017.0069", "date": "2017-10-26", "authors": [["J\u00f3zefczuk", "Jan", "J", "1 The Paediatric Ward with the Paediatric Cardiology Unit, Specialist Hospital of the Holy Spirit , Sandomierz, Poland ."], ["Konopka", "Ewa", "E", "2 Laboratory of Immunology, Department of Pathology, The Children's Memorial Health Institute , Warsaw, Poland ."], ["Bier\u0142a", "Joanna Beata", "JB", "2 Laboratory of Immunology, Department of Pathology, The Children's Memorial Health Institute , Warsaw, Poland ."], ["Trojanowska", "Ilona", "I", "2 Laboratory of Immunology, Department of Pathology, The Children's Memorial Health Institute , Warsaw, Poland ."], ["Sowi\u0144ska", "Agnieszka", "A", "2 Laboratory of Immunology, Department of Pathology, The Children's Memorial Health Institute , Warsaw, Poland ."], ["Czarnecki", "Rafa\u0142", "R", "1 The Paediatric Ward with the Paediatric Cardiology Unit, Specialist Hospital of the Holy Spirit , Sandomierz, Poland ."], ["Sobol", "Lucjan", "L", "3 Department of Pathology, Specialist Hospital of the Holy Spirit , Sandomierz, Poland ."], ["J\u00f3zefczuk", "Pawe\u0142", "P", "4 Foundation for Protection of the Immunological System \"Immuno ,\" Warsaw, Poland ."], ["Surdy", "Weronika", "W", "1 The Paediatric Ward with the Paediatric Cardiology Unit, Specialist Hospital of the Holy Spirit , Sandomierz, Poland ."], ["Cukrowska", "Bo\u017cena", "B", "2 Laboratory of Immunology, Department of Pathology, The Children's Memorial Health Institute , Warsaw, Poland ."]]}
