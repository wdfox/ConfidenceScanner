{"title": "Beyond survival: 5-year neurodevelopmental follow-up of a cohort of preterm infants in Colombo, Sri Lanka.", "text": "There is a lack of information on long-term neurodevelopmental outcome in preterm neonates in low- and middle-income countries.To describe the developmental attainments of preterm neonates followed up for 5\u00a0years and to identify the risk factors for impairment.A prospective descriptive cohort study was undertaken in neonates of 34\u00a0weeks gestation born within a period of 12\u00a0months at a single tertiary maternity and neonatal unit in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Infants were assessed for neurodevelopment using the Bayley Infant and Toddler III\u00ae Assessments at 6, 12 and 24\u00a0months of corrected age and school readiness assessment at 5\u00a0years.Fifty-one infants were assessed at least once, 45 were assessed at 2\u00a0years and 39 had a final assessment at 5\u00a0years. Neurodevelopmental attainment deteriorated significantly in the cognitive and motor composite scores from 6 to 24\u00a0months (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). By 5\u00a0years the number of children with delay in cognitive, language and motor domains had reduced significantly from 24\u00a0months (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) but the cognitive skills remained most affected (10/39). At 5\u00a0years, 13 of 39 children had a confirmed diagnosis of a neurodevelopmental disorder: eight had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, three autism spectrum disorder, one cerebral palsy and one visual impairment. Surfactant administration and retinopathy of prematurity were the most significant risks for delayed development at 5\u00a0years (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).Deterioration of cognitive and motor composite scores over the first 24\u00a0months highlights the need for regular surveillance of premature infants. There was a discrepancy between the diagnosis of neurodevelopmental delay at 24\u00a0months and at 5\u00a0years. But the notable impact on school readiness skills requires public health initiatives to cater for the needs of these children.", "journal": ["Paediatrics and international child health", "Paediatr Int Child Health"], "id": "29043919", "doi": "10.1080/20469047.2017.1380944", "date": "2017-10-18", "authors": [["Sumanasena", "S P", "SP", "a Faculty of Medicine, Department of Disability Studies , University of Kelaniya , Ragama , Sri Lanka."], ["Vipulaguna", "D V", "DV", "b Ministry of Health , Colombo , Sri Lanka."], ["Mendis", "M M", "MM", "a Faculty of Medicine, Department of Disability Studies , University of Kelaniya , Ragama , Sri Lanka."], ["Gunawardena", "N S", "NS", "c World Health Organization Country Office for Sri Lanka , Colombo , Sri Lanka."]]}
