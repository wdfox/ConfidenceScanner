{"title": "Changes in Depressive Symptoms Among Adolescents with ASD Completing the PEERS\u00ae Social Skills Intervention.", "text": "Depression is a common concern among people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and is often associated with social skills and relationship challenges. The present data, from a randomized controlled trial, examined the effect of PEERS\u00ae on self-reported depressive symptoms via the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) among 49 adolescents with ASD. Findings revealed that many CDI subscale scores declined (p's\u2009<\u20090.05) and were related to direct social contact on the Quality of Socialization Questionnaire at posttest (p's\u2009<\u20090.05). Exploratory analyses uncovered that suicidality was less evident following PEERS\u00ae. Findings support the notion that social functioning and depression may be intimately intertwined in ASD; therefore, bolstering social skills in ASD may positively influence other domains of functioning, including mental health.", "journal": ["Journal of autism and developmental disorders", "J Autism Dev Disord"], "id": "29164445", "doi": "10.1007/s10803-017-3396-6", "date": "2017-11-21", "authors": [["Schiltz", "Hillary K", "HK", "Marquette University, 604 N 16th St. Cramer Hall, Milwaukee, WI, 53233, USA. hillary.schiltz@marquette.edu."], ["McVey", "Alana J", "AJ", "Marquette University, 604 N 16th St. Cramer Hall, Milwaukee, WI, 53233, USA."], ["Dolan", "Bridget K", "BK", "Marquette University, 604 N 16th St. Cramer Hall, Milwaukee, WI, 53233, USA."], ["Willar", "Kirsten S", "KS", "Marquette University, 604 N 16th St. Cramer Hall, Milwaukee, WI, 53233, USA."], ["Pleiss", "Sheryl", "S", "Marquette University, 604 N 16th St. Cramer Hall, Milwaukee, WI, 53233, USA."], ["Karst", "Jeffrey S", "JS", "Marquette University, 604 N 16th St. Cramer Hall, Milwaukee, WI, 53233, USA."], ["Carson", "Audrey M", "AM", "Marquette University, 604 N 16th St. Cramer Hall, Milwaukee, WI, 53233, USA."], ["Caiozzo", "Christina", "C", "Marquette University, 604 N 16th St. Cramer Hall, Milwaukee, WI, 53233, USA."], ["Vogt", "Elisabeth M", "EM", "Marquette University, 604 N 16th St. Cramer Hall, Milwaukee, WI, 53233, USA."], ["Yund", "Brianna D", "BD", "University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, 2441 E.
