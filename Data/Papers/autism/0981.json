{"title": "The Effects of Bug-in-Ear Coaching on Pre-Service Behavior Analysts' Use of Functional Communication Training.", "text": "Behavior analysts play an important role in supporting the behavior and learning of young children with disabilities in natural settings. However, there is very little research related specifically to developing the skills and competencies needed by pre-service behavior analysts. This study examined the effects of \"bug-in-ear\" (BIE) coaching on pre-service behavior analysts' implementation of functional communication training with pre-school children with autism in their classrooms. BIE coaching was associated with increases in the rate of functional communication training trials each intern initiated per session and in the fidelity with which interns implemented functional communication training. Adults created more intentional opportunities for children to communicate, and adults provided more systematic instruction around those opportunities.", "journal": ["Behavior analysis in practice", "Behav Anal Pract"], "id": "29021934", "doi": "10.1007/s40617-016-0166-4", "date": "2017-01-24", "authors": [["Artman-Meeker", "Kathleen", "K", "College of Education, University of Washington, Box 353600, Seattle, WA 98195 USA."], ["Rosenberg", "Nancy", "N", "College of Education, University of Washington, Box 353600, Seattle, WA 98195 USA."], ["Badgett", "Natalie", "N", "College of Education, University of Washington, Box 353600, Seattle, WA 98195 USA."], ["Yang", "Xueyan", "X", "College of Education, University of Washington, Box 353600, Seattle, WA 98195 USA."], ["Penney", "Ashley", "A", "University of Washington Autism Center, Seattle, WA 98195 USA."]]}
