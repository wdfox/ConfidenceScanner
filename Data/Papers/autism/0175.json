{"title": "Development of Emotion Self-Regulation Among Young Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders: The Role of Parents.", "text": "Emotional self-regulation (ESR) challenges are well-documented in the diagnostic profiles of children with Autism; however, less is known about the development of ESR and the role of parents in ESR development for this population. Thirty-seven young children with autism and one of their parents participated in a home-based, observational study exploring the associations between the children's social communication and sensory processing characteristics and their parents' behaviors associated with ESR development. Findings revealed that parent use of physical and language behaviors were associated with child social communication abilities. No associations between child sensory processing and parent behaviors were found. Understanding the interactive processes between parents and children with ASD has implications for the development of parent-based interventions that increase child ESR.", "journal": ["Journal of autism and developmental disorders", "J Autism Dev Disord"], "id": "29249011", "doi": "10.1007/s10803-017-3430-8", "date": "2017-12-16", "authors": [["Laurent", "Amy C", "AC", "University of Rhode Island, 201 Tyler Hall, Kingston, RI, 02881, USA.
