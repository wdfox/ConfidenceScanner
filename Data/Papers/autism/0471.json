{"title": "Abnormalities in Interactions of Rho GTPases with Scaffolding Proteins Contribute to Neurodevelopmental Disorders.", "text": "Accumulating evidence suggests that Rho GTPases, together with scaffolding SHANK proteins, and associated signaling pathways play a role in the development of autism symptoms in various conditions. Research data have brought information on multiple intracellular signaling pathways, including Rho-associated protein kinases and serine/threonine-protein kinases involved in cytoskeleton rearranging. Alterations in downstream effectors of GTPase signaling pathways are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Bioinformatics and experimental data show that complex genetic and molecular defects (GTPases, actin-binding proteins, kinases, neuropeptides) can result in neuronal remodeling, leading to the functional connectivity deficits that manifest as the heterogeneous autism spectrum phenotype. Finally, the known hormone and neuropeptide oxytocin appears to be a factor for consideration in therapeutic intervention.", "journal": ["Journal of neuroscience research", "J. Neurosci.
