{"title": "How pupils on the autism spectrum make sense of themselves in the context of their experiences in a mainstream school setting: A qualitative metasynthesis.", "text": "Evidence that interpersonal interactions and self-appraisal in social context are crucial in developing self-understanding raises concerns about how pupils with autism spectrum disorder make sense of themselves in school settings where many experience social marginalisation. Metasynthesis was used to systematically extract and integrate findings from qualitative studies examining the mainstream school experiences of these students. Synthesised findings identified three, intermeshing, aspects of experience which contribute to many pupils with autism spectrum disorder making sense of themselves as 'different' to typical peers in a negative way: difficulties linked to autism spectrum disorder; interpersonal relationships, particularly with peers; and accessibility of the school environment. Typical pupils' attitudes and responses towards peers with autism spectrum disorder, unusual sensory reactions to the physical school environment and individual sense-making about the self are highlighted as key areas requiring further research and intervention to improve the experiences, self-esteem and well-being of pupils with autism spectrum disorder in inclusive settings and to inform educational policy and practice.", "journal": ["Autism : the international journal of research and practice", "Autism"], "id": "29139322", "doi": "10.1177/1362361317723836", "date": "2017-11-01", "authors": [["Williams", "Emma I", "EI", "University of Surrey, UK."], ["Gleeson", "Kate", "K", "University of Surrey, UK."], ["Jones", "Bridget E", "BE", "University of Surrey, UK."]]}
