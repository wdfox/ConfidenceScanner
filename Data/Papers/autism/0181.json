The BST package was delivered in small group instruction and included (i) instructions about having a conversation, (ii) modeling a conversation, (iii) practicing a conversation, and (iv) feedback on performance during each session. Results indicated that BST was effective for increasing appropriate conversation interactions for all six participants, and maintenance was evident 4 weeks post intervention.
