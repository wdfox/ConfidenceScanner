{"title": "The promise of induced pluripotent stem cells for neurodevelopmental disorders.", "text": "A major challenge in clinical genetics and medicine is represented by genetically and phenotypically highly diverse neurodevelopmental disorders, like for example intellectual disability and autism. Intellectual disability is characterized by substantial limitations in cognitive function and adaptive behaviour. At the cellular level, this is reflected by deficits in synaptic structure and plasticity and therefore has been coined as a synaptic disorder or \"synaptopathy\". In this review, we summarize the findings from recent studies in which iPSCs have been used to model specific neurodevelopmental syndromes, including Fragile X syndrome, Rett syndrome, Williams-Beuren syndrome and Phelan-McDermid syndrome. We discuss what we have learned from these studies and what key issues need to be addressed to move the field forward.", "journal": ["Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry", "Prog.
