{"title": "Association of Autism Spectrum Disorders and Inflammatory Bowel Disease.", "text": "Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) both have multifactorial pathogenesis with an increasing number of studies demonstrating gut-brain associations. We aim to examine the association between ASD and IBD using strict classification criteria for IBD. We conducted a retrospective case-cohort study using records from the Military Health System database with IBD defined as having one encounter with an ICD-9-CM diagnostic code for IBD and at least one outpatient prescription dispensed for a medication to treat IBD. Children with ASD were more likely to meet criteria for Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative colitis (UC) compared to controls. This higher prevalence of CD and UC in children with ASD compared to controls confirms the association of ASD with IBD.", "journal": ["Journal of autism and developmental disorders", "J Autism Dev Disord"], "id": "29170940", "doi": "10.1007/s10803-017-3409-5", "date": "2017-11-23", "authors": [["Lee", "Maunoo", "M", "Department of Pediatrics, F.
