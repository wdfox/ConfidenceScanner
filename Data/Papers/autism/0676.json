{"title": "Factors That May Influence Parent Treatment Decision Making for Young Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.", "text": "The number of interventions available for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has expanded greatly in recent years, although relatively little is known about the factors that influence family caregivers as they make treatment decisions for their children. This study involved a statewide survey of parents of young children with ASD to examine the relative weights of the factors that influenced their treatment decisions. Results suggested that caregivers rely on their own intuition for much decision making, although selected professionals are also influential. Implications for professionals working with children with ASD and their families are discussed.", "journal": ["Journal of social work in disability & rehabilitation", "J Soc Work Disabil Rehabil"], "id": "29111961", "doi": "10.1080/1536710X.2017.1392395", "date": "2017-12-18", "authors": [["Dinora", "Parthenia", "P", "a Partnership for People with Disabilities , Virginia Commonwealth University , Richmond , Virginia , USA."], ["Bogenschutz", "Matthew", "M", "b School of Social Work , Virginia Commonwealth University , Richmond , Virginia , USA."], ["Lynch", "Kathleen", "K", "a Partnership for People with Disabilities , Virginia Commonwealth University , Richmond , Virginia , USA."]]}
