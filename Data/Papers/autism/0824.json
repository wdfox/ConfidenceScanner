{"title": "Information, Advocacy and Signposting as a Low-Level Support for Adults with High-Functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder: An Example from the UK.", "text": "'Low-level' support is championed to support adults with high functioning autism spectrum disorder (HFASD) to achieve good quality health and social care, yet research in the area is sparse. Drawing on semi-structured interview data, this paper considers the efficacy of an intervention to provide low-level support to adults with HFASD with little or no funded support. The intervention led to a number of perceived positive outcomes for adults with HFASD, their families, and service providers in the city, including increased access to education, volunteering, support and information, socialising, improved health and wellbeing, and managing day-to-day. Although many of life's difficulties still persisted, the intervention helped service users overcome barriers to availing further support, possibly leading to beneficial outcomes down the line.", "journal": ["Journal of autism and developmental disorders", "J Autism Dev Disord"], "id": "29063482", "doi": "10.1007/s10803-017-3331-x", "date": "2017-10-23", "authors": [["Southby", "Kris", "K", "Centre for Health Promotion Research, Leeds Beckett University, Rm. 512 Calverley Building, City Campus, Leeds, LS1 3HE, UK. k.southby@leedsbeckett.ac.uk."], ["Robinson", "Olivia", "O", "Institute for Health and Wellbeing, Leeds Beckett University, Leeds, UK."]]}
