{"title": "Increased trophoblast inclusions in placentas from prematurely born infants: A potential marker of risk for preterm neurodevelopmental outcomes.", "text": "Trophoblast inclusions (TIs) are placental abnormalities of the trophoblast bilayer. Present in 2-8% of full-term placentas, they are associated with poor neurodevelopment, including autism. Although previously unstudied, examination of chorionic villi from 108 preterm births revealed a \u223c4 fold increase in the frequency of TIs (30.5%). Frequency of TIs was inversely related to gestational age (GA); 43% of placentas <30 weeks and 20% of placentas \u226532 weeks had TIs (\u03c72\u00a0=\u00a04.41, p\u00a0=\u00a00.036). This increased prevalence in preterm infants suggests that TIs may indicate adverse intrauterine processes or undetected genetic abnormalities and could identify infants at risk for poor neurodevelopment.", "journal": ["Placenta", "Placenta"], "id": "29208241", "doi": "10.1016/j.placenta.2017.10.006", "date": "2017-10-26", "authors": [["Firestein", "Morgan R", "MR", "Department of Psychology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.
