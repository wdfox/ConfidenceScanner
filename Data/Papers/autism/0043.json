{"title": "Mirror Neurons Modeled Through Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity are Affected by Channelopathies Associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder.", "text": "Mirror neurons fire action potentials both when the agent performs a certain behavior and watches someone performing a similar action. Here, we present an original mirror neuron model based on the spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) between two morpho-electrical models of neocortical pyramidal neurons. Both neurons fired spontaneously with basal firing rate that follows a Poisson distribution, and the STDP between them was modeled by the triplet algorithm. Our simulation results demonstrated that STDP is sufficient for the rise of mirror neuron function between the pairs of neocortical neurons. This is a proof of concept that pairs of neocortical neurons associating sensory inputs to motor outputs could operate like mirror neurons. In addition, we used the mirror neuron model to investigate whether channelopathies associated with autism spectrum disorder could impair the modeled mirror function. Our simulation results showed that impaired hyperpolarization-activated cationic currents (Ih) affected the mirror function between the pairs of neocortical neurons coupled by STDP.", "journal": ["International journal of neural systems", "Int J Neural Syst"], "id": "29297264", "doi": "10.1142/S0129065717500587", "date": "2017-11-28", "authors": [["Antunes", "Gabriela", "G", "1 Department of Physics, Faculdade de Filosofia, Ciencias e Letras de Ribeirao Preto, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil."], ["da Silva", "Samuel F Faria", "SFF", "2 Pontificia Universidade Catolica de Campinas, Campinas, SP, Brazil."], ["de Souza", "Fabio M Simoes", "FMS", "3 Center for Mathematics, Computation and Cognition, Federal University of ABC, Sao Bernardo do Campo, SP, Brazil."]]}
