{"title": "The functional and developmental role of imitation in the (a)typical brain.", "text": "Keven & Akins (K&A) propose a biologically plausible view of neonatal imitation based on the analysis of sensorimotor development. Here, we consider imitation in the general context of motor cognition, taking examples from both typical and atypical development. Specifically, we will discuss the functional role of imitation, its multi-level nature, and its anomalous features in autism.", "journal": ["The Behavioral and brain sciences", "Behav Brain Sci"], "id": "29342818", "doi": "10.1017/S0140525X16001278", "date": null, "authors": [["Casartelli", "Luca", "L", "Scientific Institute IRCCS Medea,Child Psychopathology Unit, 23842\u00a0-\u00a0Bosisio Parini (Lecco),Italy.luca.casartelli@emedea.ithttp://neurophilosophy.unimi.it/people.php."], ["Parma", "Valentina", "V", "International School for Advanced Studies\u00a0-\u00a0SISSA,Neuroscience Area,34136 Trieste,Italy.vparma@sissa.ithttp://insula.sissa.it/people/valentina-parma."]]}
