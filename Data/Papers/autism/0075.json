The two missense variants occurred at evolutionarily conserved amino acids and are located within the SET domain, which plays a pivotal role in catalyzing histone methylation. Previous studies have suggested that de novo microdeletions in the 12q24.3 region encompassing SETD1B were associated with developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, autism/autistic behavior, large stature and craniofacial anomalies. Comparative mapping of 12q24.3 deletions refined the candidate locus, indicating KDM2B and SETD1B to be the most plausible candidate genes for the pathogenicity of 12q24.3 deletion syndrome. Our cases showed epilepsy, developmental delay, intellectual disabilities, autistic behavior and craniofacial dysmorphic features, which are consistent with those of individuals with de novo 12q24.31 deletions.
