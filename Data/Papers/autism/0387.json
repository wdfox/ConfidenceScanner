{"title": "The Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire: Validation of a French Language Version and Refinement of Sensory Profiles of People with High Autism-Spectrum Quotient.", "text": "Sensory sensitivity peculiarities represent an important characteristic of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). We first validated a French language version of the Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire (GSQ) (Robertson and Simmons in J Autism Dev Disord 43(4):775-784, 2013). The GSQ score was strongly positively correlated with the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) (r\u2009=\u20090.81, p\u2009<\u200910-6, n\u2009=\u2009245). We further examined sensory profiles of groups with high versus low AQ. The high AQ group scored higher at the GSQ than the low AQ group for every sensory modality. Moreover, the high AQ group showed greater consistency in their patterns of hypersensitivity and hyposensitivity between sensory modalities, and stronger correlations between hyper and hyposensitivity. Results are discussed in the context of theories accounting for atypical sensory perception in ASD.", "journal": ["Journal of autism and developmental disorders", "J Autism Dev Disord"], "id": "29189917", "doi": "10.1007/s10803-017-3422-8", "date": "2017-11-30", "authors": [["Sapey-Triomphe", "Laurie-Anne", "LA", "Lyon Neuroscience Research Centre, Brain Dynamics and Cognition Team, CNRS UMR5292, INSERM U1028, Universit\u00e9 Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, F-69000, Lyon, France."], ["Moulin", "Annie", "A", "Lyon Neuroscience Research Centre, Brain Dynamics and Cognition Team, CNRS UMR5292, INSERM U1028, Universit\u00e9 Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, F-69000, Lyon, France."], ["Soni\u00e9", "Sandrine", "S", "Lyon Neuroscience Research Centre, Brain Dynamics and Cognition Team, CNRS UMR5292, INSERM U1028, Universit\u00e9 Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, F-69000, Lyon, France."], ["Schmitz", "Christina", "C", "Lyon Neuroscience Research Centre, Brain Dynamics and Cognition Team, CNRS UMR5292, INSERM U1028, Universit\u00e9 Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, F-69000, Lyon, France. christina.schmitz@inserm.fr."]]}
