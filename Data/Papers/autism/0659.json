{"title": "Sensory Sensitivity and Food Selectivity in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.", "text": "Few studies have compared atypical sensory characteristics and food selectivity between children with and without autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We compared oral sensory processing between children with (n\u2009=\u200953) and without ASD (n\u2009=\u200958), ages 3-11\u00a0years. We also examined the relationships between atypical oral sensory processing, food selectivity, and fruit/vegetable consumption in children with ASD. We found that more children with ASD presented with atypical sensory processing than children without ASD. Among children with ASD, those with atypical oral sensory sensitivity refused more foods and ate fewer vegetables than those with typical oral sensory sensitivity. The findings suggest that efforts to address food selectivity in children with ASD may be enhanced by including strategies that address oral sensory processing.", "journal": ["Journal of autism and developmental disorders", "J Autism Dev Disord"], "id": "29116421", "doi": "10.1007/s10803-017-3340-9", "date": "2017-11-07", "authors": [["Chistol", "Liem T", "LT", "Sargent College of Health & Rehabilitation Sciences, Boston University, 635 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, MA, 02215, USA."], ["Bandini", "Linda G", "LG", "Department of Pediatrics, E.K.
