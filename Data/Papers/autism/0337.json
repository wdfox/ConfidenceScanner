{"title": "Brief Report: Factor Analysis of the Brazilian Version of the Adult Autism Spectrum Quotient.", "text": "This study examined the factor structure of the Brazilian version of the Autism-Spectrum Quotient. This is a self-report questionnaire for continuous and quantitative assessment of autistic spectrum traits in adults. Confirmatory factor analysis was performed on the five-factor model (social skill, attention switching, attention to detail, communication and imagination) proposed by the original authors, support not being found for this model in our sample. An exploratory factor analysis was then performed that resulted in an alternative three-factor model (social skills, details/patterns and imagination). Confirmatory factor analysis of the latter model revealed adequate psychometric indexes. The Brazilian version of the AQ was shown to be an adequate instrument for the evaluation of signs compatible with the autism spectrum in adults.", "journal": ["Journal of autism and developmental disorders", "J Autism Dev Disord"], "id": "29204928", "doi": "10.1007/s10803-017-3424-6", "date": "2017-12-04", "authors": [["do Egito", "Julia Horta Tabosa", "JHT", "Social and Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory, Mackenzie Presbyterian University, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil."], ["Ferreira", "Gabrielle Martins Ribeiro", "GMR", "Social and Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory, Mackenzie Presbyterian University, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil."], ["Gon\u00e7alves", "Manoela Izidoro", "MI", "Social and Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory, Mackenzie Presbyterian University, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil."], ["Os\u00f3rio", "Ana Alexandra Caldas", "AAC", "Social and Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory, Mackenzie Presbyterian University, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. ana.osorio@mackenzie.br."]]}
