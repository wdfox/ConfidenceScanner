{"title": "Effects of cross-rearing with social peers on myelination in the medial prefrontal cortex of a mouse model with autism spectrum disorder.", "text": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction, poor communication skills, and repetitive/restrictive behaviors. Recent studies have indicated that early rehabilitative intervention can alleviate the symptoms of individuals with ASD. However, it remains unknown whether rehabilitative intervention can restore brain structures such as myelin, which generally shows abnormalities in individuals with ASD. Therefore, in the present study, we used a mouse model of ASD (BTBR mice) that demonstrated asocial behaviors and hypomyelination in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to investigate whether interaction with social peers (C57BL/6J mice) has an effect on myelination. We found that housing with C57BL/6J mice after weaning through adulthood increased the myelin thickness in mPFC, but not in the motor cortex, of BTBR mice. There was no effect of cross-rearing with C57BL/6J mice on axon diameter in mPFC of BTBR mice. This finding suggests that early rehabilitative intervention may alleviate myelin abnormalities in mPFC as well as clinical symptoms in individuals with ASD.", "journal": ["Heliyon", "Heliyon"], "id": "29234739", "doi": "10.1016/j.heliyon.2017.e00468", "date": "2017-12-01", "authors": [["Makinodan", "Manabu", "M", "Department of Psychiatry, Nara Medical University School of Medicine, 840 Shijo-cho, Kashihara, Nara 634-8522, Japan."], ["Okumura", "Kazuki", "K", "Department of Psychiatry, Nara Medical University School of Medicine, 840 Shijo-cho, Kashihara, Nara 634-8522, Japan."], ["Ikawa", "Daisuke", "D", "Department of Psychiatry, Nara Medical University School of Medicine, 840 Shijo-cho, Kashihara, Nara 634-8522, Japan."], ["Yamashita", "Yasunori", "Y", "Department of Psychiatry, Nara Medical University School of Medicine, 840 Shijo-cho, Kashihara, Nara 634-8522, Japan."], ["Yamamuro", "Kazuhiko", "K", "Department of Psychiatry, Nara Medical University School of Medicine, 840 Shijo-cho, Kashihara, Nara 634-8522, Japan."], ["Toritsuka", "Michihiro", "M", "Department of Psychiatry, Nara Medical University School of Medicine, 840 Shijo-cho, Kashihara, Nara 634-8522, Japan."], ["Kimoto", "Sohei", "S", "Department of Psychiatry, Nara Medical University School of Medicine, 840 Shijo-cho, Kashihara, Nara 634-8522, Japan."], ["Yamauchi", "Takahira", "T", "Department of Psychiatry, Nara Medical University School of Medicine, 840 Shijo-cho, Kashihara, Nara 634-8522, Japan."], ["Komori", "Takashi", "T", "Department of Psychiatry, Nara Medical University School of Medicine, 840 Shijo-cho, Kashihara, Nara 634-8522, Japan."], ["Kayashima", "Yoshinori", "Y", "Department of Psychiatry, Nara Medical University School of Medicine, 840 Shijo-cho, Kashihara, Nara 634-8522, Japan."], ["Yoshino", "Hiroki", "H", "Department of Psychiatry, Nara Medical University School of Medicine, 840 Shijo-cho, Kashihara, Nara 634-8522, Japan."], ["Wanaka", "Akio", "A", "Department of Anatomy and Neuroscience, Nara Medical University School of Medicine, 840 Shijo-cho, Kashihara, Nara 634-8522, Japan."], ["Kishimoto", "Toshifumi", "T", "Department of Psychiatry, Nara Medical University School of Medicine, 840 Shijo-cho, Kashihara, Nara 634-8522, Japan."]]}
