{"title": "Traffic Related Air Pollution and Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Population Based Nested Case-Control Study in Israel.", "text": "Accumulating evidence suggests that perinatal air pollutant exposures are associated with increased risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but evidence outside the US for traffic pollutants is inconclusive. We assessed the association between NO2, a traffic pollution tracer, and risk of ASD. We conducted a nested case-control study among the entire population of children born 2005-2009 in the central coastal area of Israel. Cases were identified through the National Insurance Institute of Israel (n\u00a0=\u00a02,098). Controls were a 20% random sample of the remaining children (n\u00a0=\u00a054,191). Exposure was based on an optimized dispersion model. We estimated adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using logistic regression and a distributed-lag model. The OR per 5.85\u00a0ppb NO2 exposure during pregnancy (median, 16.8\u00a0ppb; range, 7.5-31.2) was 0.77 (95% CI: 0.59, 1.00), and the OR for exposure in the 9 months after birth was 1.40 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.80) in models mutually adjusted for the two periods. A distributed lag model revealed reduced risk around week 13 of pregnancy, and elevated risk around week 26 after birth. These findings suggest that postnatal exposure to NO2 in Israel is associated with increased odds of ASD, and prenatal exposure with lower odds. The latter may relate to selection effects.", "journal": ["American journal of epidemiology", "Am. J.
