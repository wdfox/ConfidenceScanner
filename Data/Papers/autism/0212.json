{"title": "Weight status, diet quality, perceived stress, and functional health of caregivers of children with autism spectrum disorder.", "text": "Caring for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can be highly demanding and can put significant strain on caregivers. To date, little is known about the extent to which caregivers of children with ASD experience increased levels of stress which may adversely affect health outcomes. The purpose of this secondary analysis was to compare caregivers of children with ASD and caregivers of typically developing children (TDC) in weight status, diet quality, perceived stress related to the parenting role, and functional health and well-being.Caregivers of 25 children with ASD and 30 TDC completed the 2005 Block Food Frequency Questionnaire, the 36-item Short Form of the Parenting Stress Index (PSI/SF), and the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and had their heights and weights measured during an onsite visit. Diet quality was assessed using the Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 and its dietary components and conformance to the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans.ASD caregivers did not differ significantly from TDC caregivers in body mass index or overweight/obesity prevalence (p \u2265 .28), even when controlling for covariates. In univariate analyses, ASD caregivers consumed significantly fewer empty calories from solid fats, alcohol, and added sugars than TDC caregivers (p\u00a0=\u00a0.03), but they did not differ significantly in any other dietary outcomes including nutrient adequacy (p \u2265 .10) and mean total HEI scores (p\u00a0=\u00a0.20). ASD caregivers, when compared to TDC caregivers, reported significantly greater parenting stress for the subscales difficult child and parent-child dysfunctional interaction as well as total stress (p\u00a0<\u00a0.001). In addition, 56% of ASD caregivers compared with 6.7% of TDC caregivers showed clinically significant levels of stress (p\u00a0<\u00a0.0001); a finding which remained statistically significant when controlling for covariates. ASD and TDC caregivers did not differ significantly in any SF-36 health domains related to functional health and well-being (p \u2265 .10).Despite higher reported levels of stress, ASD caregivers did not differ significantly from TDC caregivers in diet- and health-related outcomes. Nurses and other health professionals should use comprehensive screening tools to assess overall caregiver stress and levels of resilience.", "journal": ["Journal for specialists in pediatric nursing : JSPN", "J Spec Pediatr Nurs"], "id": "29240304", "doi": "10.1111/jspn.12205", "date": "2017-12-14", "authors": [["Li", "Xiaoyin Sara", "XS", "Master of Public Health Program, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennyslvania, USA."], ["Pinto-Martin", "Jennifer A", "JA", "Department of Biobehavioral Health Sciences, University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing, Philadelphia, Pennyslvania, USA."], ["Thompson", "Aleda", "A", "Department of Biobehavioral Health Sciences, University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing, Philadelphia, Pennyslvania, USA."], ["Chittams", "Jesse", "J", "Department of Biobehavioral Health Sciences, University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing, Philadelphia, Pennyslvania, USA."], ["Kral", "Tanja V E", "TVE", "Department of Biobehavioral Health Sciences, University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing, Philadelphia, Pennyslvania, USA."]]}
