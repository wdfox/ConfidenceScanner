{"title": "Assessing Quality of Program Environments for Children and Youth with Autism: Autism Program Environment Rating Scale (APERS).", "text": "The purpose of this study was to examine the psychometric properties of the Autism Program Environment Rating Scale (APERS), an instrument designed to assess quality of program environments for students with autism spectrum disorder. Data sets from two samples of public school programs that provided services to children and youth with autism spectrum disorder were utilized. Cronbach alpha analyses indicated high coefficients of internal consistency for the total APERS and moderate levels for item domains for the first data set, which was replicated with the second data set. A factor analysis of the first data set indicated that all domain scores loaded on one main factor, in alignment with the conceptual model, with this finding being replicated in the second data set. Also, the APERS was sensitive to changes resulting from a professional development program designed to promote program quality.", "journal": ["Journal of autism and developmental disorders", "J Autism Dev Disord"], "id": "29159578", "doi": "10.1007/s10803-017-3379-7", "date": "2017-11-20", "authors": [["Odom", "Samuel L", "SL", "Frank Porter Graham Child Development Institute, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, CB 8180, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599-8180, USA. slodom@unc.edu."], ["Cox", "Ann", "A", "Frank Porter Graham Child Development Institute, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, CB 8180, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599-8180, USA."], ["Sideris", "John", "J", "Frank Porter Graham Child Development Institute, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, CB 8180, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599-8180, USA."], ["Hume", "Kara A", "KA", "Frank Porter Graham Child Development Institute, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, CB 8180, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599-8180, USA."], ["Hedges", "Susan", "S", "Frank Porter Graham Child Development Institute, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, CB 8180, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599-8180, USA."], ["Kucharczyk", "Suzanne", "S", "Department of Special Education, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR, USA."], ["Shaw", "Evelyn", "E", "Frank Porter Graham Child Development Institute, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, CB 8180, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599-8180, USA."], ["Boyd", "Brian A", "BA", "Department of Allied Health Sciences, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599, USA."], ["Reszka", "Stephanie", "S", "Department of Allied Health Sciences, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599, USA."], ["Neitzel", "Jennifer", "J", "Frank Porter Graham Child Development Institute, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, CB 8180, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599-8180, USA."]]}
