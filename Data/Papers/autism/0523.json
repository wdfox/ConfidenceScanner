{"title": "Examining the Effectiveness of Naturalistic Social Skills Training in Developing Social Skills and Theory of Mind in Preschoolers with ASD.", "text": "We compared the effectiveness of two programs for developing social skills, 'Play Time/Social Time' (PT/ST) and 'I Can Problem Solve' (ICPS), in improving the social skills and theory of mind (ToM) of preschoolers with ASD. The experiment took place in a classroom setting. Fifty-two children attended and data were analyzed with latent growth curve models. Comparison with a control group indicated that both programs were effective in developing social skills. The PT/ST program was more effective than ICPS in developing interaction skills; both programs improved children's ability to cope with difficult social situations. The ICPS program was marginally effective in developing ToM when compared with PT/ST and control condition. These results are relevant to children with ASD and their teachers.", "journal": ["Journal of autism and developmental disorders", "J Autism Dev Disord"], "id": "29159579", "doi": "10.1007/s10803-017-3377-9", "date": "2017-11-20", "authors": [["Szumski", "Grzegorz", "G", "Department of Educational Sciences, The Maria Grzegorzewska University, Szczesliwicka St. 40, 02-353, Warsaw, Poland. bgszum@poczta.onet.pl."], ["Smogorzewska", "Joanna", "J", "Department of Educational Sciences, The Maria Grzegorzewska University, Szczesliwicka St. 40, 02-353, Warsaw, Poland."], ["Grygiel", "Pawe\u0142", "P", "Institute of Education, Faculty of Philosophy, Jagiellonian University, Golebia St. 24, 31-007, Cracow, Poland."], ["Orlando", "Ann-Marie", "AM", "Department of Psychiatry, Center for Autism and Related Disabilities, University of Florida, Golebia 24 st., PO Box 100234, Gainesville, FL, 32609, USA."]]}
