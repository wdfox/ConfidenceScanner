{"title": "Behavioral, Cognitive and Neural Markers of Asperger Syndrome.", "text": "Asperger syndrome (AS) is a subtype of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) characterized by major problems in social and nonverbal communication, together with limited and repetitive forms of behavior and interests. The linguistic and cognitive development in AS is preserved which help us to differentiate it from other subtypes of ASD. However, significant effects of AS on cognitive abilities and brain functions still need to be researched. Although a clear cut pathology for Asperger has not been identified yet, recent studies have largely focused on brain imaging techniques to investigate AS. In this regard, we carried out a systematic review on behavioral, cognitive, and neural markers (specifically using MRI and fMRI) studies on AS. In this paper, behavior, motor skills and language capabilities of individuals with Asperger are compared to those in healthy controls. In addition, common findings across MRI and fMRI based studies associated with behavior and cognitive disabilities are highlighted.", "journal": ["Basic and clinical neuroscience", "Basic Clin Neurosci"], "id": "29167722", "doi": "10.18869/nirp.bcn.8.5.349", "date": null, "authors": [["Faridi", "Farnaz", "F", "Institute for Cognitive and Brain Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran."], ["Khosrowabadi", "Reza", "R", "Institute for Cognitive and Brain Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran."]]}
