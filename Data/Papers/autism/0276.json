Healthy controls were selected from five kindergartens and one primary school in Harbin by the stratified cluster random sampling (control group) . The Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) was used to investigate the sleep problems of the two groups. The patients were matched in a 1\u22361 ratio for the age and sex, and the urine samples of case-control pairs were collected in the morning. The level of 6-SM was measured by the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The student's t test was used for comparison between the ASD group and control group, and the Pearson correlation analysis was used to determine the correlation difference.

Conclusion: The children with ASD were at high risk for sleep problems, and the melatonin metabolite of ASD group was abnormal compared with that of the control group. Moreover, there was a negative correlation between the severity of sleep problems and the level of 6-SM in ASD children. The results of our study indicate that the abnormal melatonin metabolism may be one of the causes of sleep problems in children with ASD.\u76ee\u7684\uff1a \u4e86\u89e3\u5b64\u72ec\u75c7\u8c31\u7cfb\u969c\u788d\uff08ASD\uff09\u60a3\u513f\u7684\u7761\u7720\u95ee\u9898\u53d1\u751f\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u4e0e\u892a\u9ed1\u6fc0\u7d20\u4ee3\u8c22\u6307\u68076-\u7f9f\u57fa\u786b\u9178\u892a\u9ed1\u7d20\uff086-SM\uff09\u7684\u5173\u8054\u6027\u3002 \u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a \u524d\u77bb\u6027\u75c5\u4f8b\u5bf9\u7167\u7814\u7a76\u30022015\u5e7410\u6708\u81f32017\u5e744\u6708\u5728\u54c8\u5c14\u6ee8\u533b\u79d1\u5927\u5b66\u513f\u7ae5\u53d1\u80b2\u884c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8fdb\u884c\u5eb7\u590d\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ca\u54c8\u5c14\u6ee8\u5e02\u7279\u6b8a\u6559\u80b2\u5b66\u6821\u5c31\u8bfb\u7684ASD\u60a3\u513f\u4f5c\u4e3aASD\u7ec4\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u6574\u7fa4\u968f\u673a\u62bd\u6837\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u54c8\u5c14\u6ee8\u5e025\u6240\u5e7c\u513f\u56ed\u53ca1\u6240\u5c0f\u5b66\u62bd\u53d6\u5065\u5eb7\u513f\u7ae5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u513f\u7ae5\u7761\u7720\u4e60\u60ef\u95ee\u5377\uff08CSHQ\uff09\u5bf9\u4e24\u7ec4\u513f\u7ae5\u8fdb\u884c\u7761\u7720\u95ee\u9898\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u96c6\u6309\u5e74\u9f84\u3001\u6027\u522b1\u22361\u5339\u914d\u7684\u75c5\u4f8b-\u5bf9\u7167\u513f\u7ae5\u7684\u6668\u5c3f\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u9176\u8054\u514d\u75ab\u5438\u9644\u8bd5\u9a8c\uff08ELISA\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u6668\u5c3f\u4e2d\u76846-SM\u6c34\u5e73\u3002\u91c7\u7528t\u68c0\u9a8c\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec4\u95f4\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0cPearson\u76f8\u5173\u5206\u6790\u8fdb\u884c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u68c0\u9a8c\u3002 \u7ed3\u679c\uff1a \u5171\u7eb3\u5165212\u4f8bASD\u60a3\u513f\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u5e74\u9f84\uff086.0\u00b12.7\uff09\u5c81\uff0c\u7537181\u4f8b\uff0885.4%\uff09\uff1b334\u540d\u5bf9\u7167\u513f\u7ae5\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u5e74\u9f84\uff085.9\u00b12.6\uff09\u5c81\uff0c\u7537272\u4f8b\uff0881.4%\uff09\uff1b\u5176\u4e2d101\u5bf9\u75c5\u4f8b-\u5bf9\u7167\u513f\u7ae5\u91c7\u96c6\u6668\u5c3f\u3002\u7ecf\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\uff0cASD\u60a3\u513fCSHQ\u603b\u5206\u53ca\u7761\u7720\u62b5\u89e6\u3001\u5165\u7761\u6f5c\u4f0f\u671f\u3001\u7761\u7720\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u591c\u9192\u3001\u5f02\u6001\u7761\u7720\u3001\u7761\u7720\u547c\u5438\u969c\u788d\u53ca\u65e5\u95f4\u56f0\u5026\u51717\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u5f97\u5206\u5747\u660e\u663e\u9ad8\u4e8e\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u513f\u7ae5\uff08\u5206\uff1a48.2\u00b16.2\u6bd446.6\u00b15.4\u300111.4\u00b12.5\u6bd410.7\u00b12.8\u30011.7\u00b10.8\u6bd41.5\u00b10.7\u30014.1\u00b11.4\u6bd43.7\u00b11.1\u30014.2\u00b11.5\u6bd43.8\u00b11.1\u30018.5\u00b11.5\u6bd48.3\u00b11.4\u30013.7\u00b11.0\u6bd43.4\u00b10.8\u300111.7\u00b12.5\u6bd412.4\u00b12.7, t=3.16\u30013.00\u30013.23\u30012.76\u30013.19\u30011.99\u30013.45\u3001-2.72, P=0.002\u30010.003\u30010.001\u30010.006\u30010.002\u30010.048\u30010.001\u30010.007\uff09\uff1bASD\u60a3\u513f6-SM\u7684\u6c34\u5e73\u660e\u663e\u4f4e\u4e8e\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4[\uff081.24\u00b10.50\uff09\u6bd4\uff081.68\u00b10.63\uff09\u03bcg/h, t=-5.50, P<0.01]\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0eCSHQ\u603b\u5206\u5448\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\uff08r=-0.50, P<0.01\uff09\u3002 \u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a ASD\u60a3\u513f\u662f\u53d1\u751f\u7761\u7720\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u9ad8\u53d1\u7fa4\u4f53\uff0c\u4e14\u892a\u9ed1\u6fc0\u7d20\u4ee3\u8c22\u6c34\u5e73\u5f02\u4e8e\u5bf9\u7167\u513f\u7ae5\uff1bASD\u60a3\u513f\u7761\u7720\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0e\u892a\u9ed1\u6fc0\u7d20\u4ee3\u8c22\u4ea7\u72696-SM\u6c34\u5e73\u5b58\u5728\u5173\u8054\uff1b\u892a\u9ed1\u6fc0\u7d20\u4ee3\u8c22\u5f02\u5e38\u53ef\u80fd\u662fASD\u60a3\u513f\u6613\u53d1\u751f\u7761\u7720\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002.", "doi": null, "journal": ["Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics", "Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi"], "date": "2018-01-18_23:45:44"}
