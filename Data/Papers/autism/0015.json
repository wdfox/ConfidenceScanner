Research in special populations\u00a0-\u00a0specifically, individuals with autism spectrum disorder, ASD\u00a0-\u00a0may further illuminate sign/gesture similarities and differences and lead to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of growth and change. Even verbally fluent speakers with ASD display distinctive qualities in sign and gesture.", "journal": ["The Behavioral and brain sciences", "Behav Brain Sci"], "id": "29342514", "doi": "10.1017/S0140525X15002885", "date": null, "authors": [["Eigsti", "Inge-Marie", "IM", "Department of Psychological Sciences,University of Connecticut,Storrs,CT 06269.inge-marie.eigsti@uconn.eduhttp://eigsti.psy.uconn.edu/."], ["de Marchena", "Ashley", "A", "The Center for Autism Research,Philadelphia,PA 19104.demarchenaa@email.chop.edu."]]}
