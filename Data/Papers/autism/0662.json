{"title": "Multiple Behavior Phenotypes of the Fragile-X Syndrome Mouse Model Respond to Chronic Inhibition of Phosphodiesterase-4D (PDE4D).", "text": "Fragile-X syndrome (FXS) patients display intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder due to silencing of the X-linked, fragile-X mental retardation-1 (FMR1) gene. Dysregulation of cAMP metabolism is a consistent finding in patients and in the mouse and fly FXS models. We therefore explored if BPN14770, a prototypic phosphodiesterase-4D negative allosteric modulator (PDE4D-NAM) in early human clinical trials, might provide therapeutic benefit in the mouse FXS model. Daily treatment of adult male fmr1 C57Bl6 knock-out mice with BPN14770 for 14 days reduced hyperarousal, improved social interaction, and improved natural behaviors such as nesting and marble burying as well as dendritic spine morphology. There was no decrement in behavioral scores in control C57Bl6 treated with BPN14770. The behavioral benefit of BPN14770 persisted two weeks after washout of the drug. Thus, BPN14770 may be useful for the treatment of fragile-X syndrome and other disorders with decreased cAMP signaling.", "journal": ["Scientific reports", "Sci Rep"], "id": "29116166", "doi": "10.1038/s41598-017-15028-x", "date": "2017-11-07", "authors": [["Gurney", "Mark E", "ME", "Tetra Discovery Partners, Inc, Grand Rapids, MI, USA. mark@tetradiscovery.com."], ["Cogram", "Patricia", "P", "FRAXA-DVI, FRAXA, Santiago, Chile."], ["Deacon", "Robert M", "RM", "FRAXA-DVI, FRAXA, Santiago, Chile."], ["Rex", "Christopher", "C", "Afraxis, Inc, San Diego, CA, USA."], ["Tranfaglia", "Michael", "M", "FRAXA Research Foundation, Newburyport, MA, USA."]]}
