{"title": "Broadening the Scope of Peer-Mediated Intervention for Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders.", "text": "Peer-mediated intervention (PMI) is most commonly defined as a treatment approach that engages typically developing peers to teach children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) social skills and increase their social interactions, mainly in a school setting. In this letter, we address the limitations of such understanding of PMI and review the arguments for broadening its scope. In particular, we argue that there is a critical need for research on PMI that focuses on friendship, social participation, and well-being of adolescents and adults with ASD, as well as engages peers in the community settings. In conclusion, we provide a description of a befriending scheme for individuals with ASD to inspire future research and guidelines on PMI.", "journal": ["Journal of autism and developmental disorders", "J Autism Dev Disord"], "id": "29222613", "doi": "10.1007/s10803-017-3429-1", "date": "2017-12-08", "authors": [["P\u0142atos", "Mateusz", "M", "Faculty of Psychology, University of Warsaw, Stawki Str. 5/7, 00-183, Warsaw, Poland. mateusz.platos@psych.uw.edu.pl."], ["Wojaczek", "Kinga", "K", "Faculty of Psychology, University of Warsaw, Stawki Str. 5/7, 00-183, Warsaw, Poland. kinga.wojaczek@psych.uw.edu.pl."]]}
