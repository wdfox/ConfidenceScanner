{"title": "Selection and classification of gene expression in autism disorder: Use of a combination of statistical filters and a GBPSO-SVM algorithm.", "text": "In this work, gene expression in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is analyzed with the goal of selecting the most attributed genes and performing classification. The objective was achieved by utilizing a combination of various statistical filters and a wrapper-based geometric binary particle swarm optimization-support vector machine (GBPSO-SVM) algorithm. The utilization of different filters was accentuated by incorporating a mean and median ratio criterion to remove very similar genes. The results showed that the most discriminative genes that were identified in the first and last selection steps included the presence of a repetitive gene (CAPS2), which was assigned as the gene most highly related to ASD risk. The merged gene subset that was selected by the GBPSO-SVM algorithm was able to enhance the classification accuracy.", "journal": ["PloS one", "PLoS ONE"], "id": "29095904", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0187371", "date": "2017-11-02", "authors": [["Hameed", "Shilan S", "SS", "Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Computing, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Johor Bahru, Malaysia."], ["Hassan", "Rohayanti", "R", "Department of Software Engineering, Faculty of Computing, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Johor Bahru, Malaysia."], ["Muhammad", "Fahmi F", "FF", "Department of Physics, Faculty of Science & Health, Koya University, Koya, Kurdistan Region, Iraq."]]}
