{"title": "Body composition of patients with autism spectrum disorder through bioelectrical impedance.", "text": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in sociability, communication, and limited repertoire of interests and behaviors.We aimed to investigate the nutritional status through bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and antrophometrics variables in 63 ASD children and adolescents (10.5 \u00b1 4.1 years; 81% male).Anthropometric variables were weight, height, and waist circumference (WC); body composition (fat mass, fat free mass) and phase angle (PA) were obtained through BIA.The body mass index showed a prevalence of overweight, obesity and underweight of 38.9, 36.5 and 15.8%, respectively. According to the body fat percentual, obesity prevalence was 49.2%, and 49.2% showed WC > 80th\u00a0percentile for age. Eleven patients presented lower PA values than references.According to the these parameters, a large percentual of ASD children and adolescents in this sample had total overweight and obesity and truncal adiposity, which causes concern, as well as the percentage of underweight participants.", "journal": ["Nutricion hospitalaria", "Nutr Hosp"], "id": "29095012", "doi": null, "date": "2017-07-28", "authors": [["Castro", "Kamila", "K", "kamilacastro@hotmail.com.br."], ["Slongo Faccioli", "Larissa", "L", null], ["Baronio", "Diego", "D", null], ["Gottfried", "Carmem", "C", null], ["Schweigert Perry", "Ingrid", "I", null], ["Riesgo", "Rudimar", "R", null]]}
