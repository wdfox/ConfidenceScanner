It is considered as a neurological disorder that affects brain function leading to impaired development in social interaction and communication skills. Some clinical trials demonstrated that certain acupuncture points play relatively significant role in improving both signs and symptoms of this disease. Owing to limited information available about acupuncture point's combination and protocols, the present study aimed to explore the most frequently used acupuncture points and their channels for children with autism. Thirteen articles about autism enhancement were selected from 2007 to 2015. Acupoints and their channels used in these articles were analyzed according to usage frequencies. The present study identified the following main channels that contribute\u00a0to autism symptoms\u00a0enhancement along with the corresponding points' frequencies: Governing Vessel channel (12), Gall bladder channel (9), Kidney channel (8), Pericardium channel (7), Extra points channel (7), Liver channel (7), Heart channel (6), Conception vessel channel (6), and Bladder channel (6). On the other hand, the frequency of each corresponding acupuncture points are EX-HN1 (5), GV-17 (4), PC-6 (4), LR-3 (3), KI-3 (3), HT-7 (3), Lu-9 (3), GV-20 (2), GV-24 (2), GV-24.5 (2), GB-13(2), GB-19 (2), KI-4 (2), LR-4 (2), ST-36 (2), SP-3 (2), SP-6 (2). In conclusion, the consensus is that both channels and points may have an important role in autism symptoms enhancement. Based on the present study, the specific channels and points selection and stimulation types need further investigation through clinical trials.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jams.2017.09.001", "journal": ["Journal of acupuncture and meridian studies", "J Acupunct Meridian Stud"], "date": "2018-01-18_23:45:34"}
