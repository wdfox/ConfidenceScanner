Fifty-two parents enrolled. Following a traditional genetics results informing visit, the study coordinator stratified families by diagnostic result and uninformative result and then randomized families within each group to an intervention arm to receive the GenomeCOMPASS\u2122 report or to the usual care arm to receive a summary letter from the medical geneticist. A letter inviting enrollment included a baseline survey, which once returned, constituted enrollment. Surveys were administered at 3\u00a0months post-genetics visit. At 6\u00a0months, the usual care arm crossed over to receive the intervention and were administered an additional survey at 3\u00a0months. Qualitative interviews were conducted following survey completion to augment the survey data regarding the patient centered outcomes of interest. Patient reported outcomes including communication, engagement, empowerment and satisfaction. In the intervention arm, GenomeCOMPASS\u2122 reports were released to 14 families (N\u2009=\u200928 parents) and of those 21 (75%) returned 3\u00a0month surveys. In the usual care arm, 12 families (N\u2009=\u200924 parents) received usual care summary letters and of those 20 (83%) returned 3\u00a0month surveys. At crossover, GenomeCOMPASS\u2122 reports were released to 20 individuals and 15 (75%) returned 3\u00a0month surveys. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 5 individuals. Use of the GenomeCOMPASS\u2122 report was reported by this small group of parents to improve communication with providers and non-health professionals such as educators and therapists and led to increased engagement and high satisfaction. Providers and others involved in the children's care also endorsed the report's effectiveness. Reports that addressed negative findings, i.e. uninformative results, were not found to be useful.
