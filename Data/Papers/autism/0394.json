{"title": "In Search of Culturally Appropriate Autism Interventions: Perspectives of Latino Caregivers.", "text": "Most evidence-based autism spectrum disorder (ASD) interventions are tested with primarily White, mid-upper class, English-speaking populations, despite the increase in Latino children with ASD in early intervention programs throughout the United States. Unfortunately, interventions that are incongruent with a target population's culture may be relatively ineffective. This mixed-methods study explored how culturally appropriate, feasible, and acceptable Latino caregivers perceived intervention models, strategies, and targets. Survey data were compared for 28 Latino and 27 non-Latino White parents of young children with ASD. Further, 20 Latino caregivers participated in focus groups to describe their challenges, perspectives and preferences for intervention strategies and models, and unmet needs from providers. These findings underscore the need for culturally modified interventions for Latino children and families.", "journal": ["Journal of autism and developmental disorders", "J Autism Dev Disord"], "id": "29188586", "doi": "10.1007/s10803-017-3394-8", "date": "2017-11-29", "authors": [["DuBay", "Michaela", "M", "Department of Allied Health Sciences, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 321 S Columbia St., Chapel Hill, NC, 27516, USA.
