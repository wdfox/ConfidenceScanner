{"title": "The use of behavior modeling training in a mobile app parent training program to improve functional communication of young children with autism spectrum disorder.", "text": "Communication intervention in early life can significantly impact long-term outcomes for young children with autism. Parents can be vital resources in the midst of the current manpower shortage. Map4speech is a new mobile application developed for parents of children with autism spectrum disorder. It is specially designed to provide high-quality, interactive learning, coupled with frequent feedback and live coaching to train parents in a naturalistic language intervention. A multiple-baseline single-case experimental design was conducted across three parent-child dyads. Results indicate that procedural integrity of parents' intervention techniques was above 85% during post-training intervention, and their respective children showed increases in spontaneous word/gesture use. The results show that mobile applications with feedback can be a promising means for improving efficiency and effectiveness in disseminating evidence-based practices for autism intervention.", "journal": ["Autism : the international journal of research and practice", "Autism"], "id": "29153002", "doi": "10.1177/1362361316683887", "date": "2017-03-01", "authors": [["Law", "Gloria C", "GC", "National Institute of Education, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore."], ["Neihart", "Maureen", "M", "National Institute of Education, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore."], ["Dutt", "Anuradha", "A", "National Institute of Education, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore."]]}
