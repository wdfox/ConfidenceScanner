{"title": "Hot and cool executive function in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder: Cross-sectional developmental trajectories.", "text": "The development of executive function (EF) in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has only been investigated using \"cool\"-cognitive-EF tasks. Little is known about the development of \"hot\"-affective-EF and whether it follows a similar developmental pathway. This study employed a cross-sectional developmental trajectories approach to examine the developmental changes in cool (working memory, inhibition, and planning) and hot EF (delay discounting and affective decision-making) of ASD participants (n\u00a0=\u00a079) and controls (n\u00a0=\u00a091) relative to age and IQ, shedding more light on the hot-cool EF organization. The developmental trajectories of some aspects of cool EF (working memory and planning) differed significantly as a function of age in ASD participants relative to controls. For both hot EFs, no significant age-related changes were found in either group. These findings extend our understanding regarding the maturation of EF from childhood through adolescence in ASD.", "journal": ["Child neuropsychology : a journal on normal and abnormal development in childhood and adolescence", "Child Neuropsychol"], "id": "29052463", "doi": "10.1080/09297049.2017.1391190", "date": "2017-10-20", "authors": [["Kouklari", "Evangelia-Chrysanthi", "EC", "a Department of Psychology, Social Work and Counselling , University of Greenwich , London , UK."], ["Tsermentseli", "Stella", "S", "a Department of Psychology, Social Work and Counselling , University of Greenwich , London , UK."], ["Monks", "Claire P", "CP", "a Department of Psychology, Social Work and Counselling , University of Greenwich , London , UK."]]}
