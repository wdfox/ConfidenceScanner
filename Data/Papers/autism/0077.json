Shank3 was also found to be downregulated in the CNS of the transgenic AD (TgAD) 5x familial Alzheimer's disease murine model engineered to overexpress the 42 amino acid amyloid-beta (A\u03b242) peptide. Interestingly, the application of known pro-inflammatory stressors, such as the A\u03b242 peptide and the metal-neurotoxin aluminum sulfate, to human neuronal-glial cells in primary culture resulted in a significant decrease in the expression of Shank3.
