{"title": "Identifying Depression in Parents of Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder: Recommendations for Professional Practice.", "text": "Parents of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) face many challenges, not the least of which can be dealing with their own depression. Depression decreases an individual's capacity for self-care and is often overlooked in this population striving to manage the demands of parenting their child with ASD. This article examines current literature related to prevalence, diagnosis, and interventions for depression in parents of children with ASD. The review indicates that depression is more common in parents of children with ASD than in the general public. However, most literature addresses parenting skills rather than depression and associated self-care deficits identified in these parents. Suggestions for best practice models and proactive interventions to caregivers are provided.
