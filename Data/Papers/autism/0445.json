{"title": "[Hypersensitivity as Extraordinary High Temporal Processing in Individuals with Autism-Spectrum Disorders].", "text": "Most individuals with autism-spectrum disorders have hypersensitivity/hyposensitivity to various types of sensory stimuli. Although several hypotheses such as higher sensitivity to stimuli, alterations in brain structure and function, and dysfunction of inhibitory systems at the molecular level have been suggested, there is no convincing evidence. We found that individuals with high temporal resolution tended to have strong hypersensitivity to sensory stimuli and vice versa. In addition, we focused on a case with extraordinarily high temporal resolution across the tactile, auditory, and audio-tactile domains. We believe that studying such an extreme case of temporal processing could facilitate an understanding of the neural basis of time perception.", "journal": ["Brain and nerve = Shinkei kenkyu no shinpo", "Brain Nerve"], "id": "29172193", "doi": "10.11477/mf.1416200905", "date": null, "authors": [["Ide", "Masakazu", "M", "Developmental Disorders Section, Department of Rehabilitation for Brain Functions, Research Institute of National Rehabilitation Center for Persons with Disabilities."], ["Yaguchi", "Ayako", "A", null], ["Atsumi", "Takeshi", "T", null], ["Yasu", "Keiichi", "K", null], ["Wada", "Makoto", "M", null]]}
