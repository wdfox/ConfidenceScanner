{"title": "Structure and function of the contactin-associated protein family in myelinated axons and their relationship with nerve diseases.", "text": "The contactin-associated protein (Caspr) family participates in nerve excitation and conduction, and neurotransmitter release in myelinated axons. We analyzed the structures and functions of the Caspr family-CNTNAP1 (Caspr1), CNTNAP2 (Caspr2), CNTNAP3 (Caspr3), CNTNAP4 (Caspr4) and CNTNAP5 (Caspr5), Caspr1-5 is not only involved in the formation of myelinated axons, but also participates in maintaining the stability of adjacent connections. Caspr1 participates in the formation, differentiation, and proliferation of neurons and astrocytes, and in motor control and cognitive function. We also analyzed the relationship between the Caspr family and neurodegenerative diseases, multiple sclerosis, and autoimmune encephalitis. However, the effects of Caspr on disease course and prognosis remain poorly understood. The effects of Caspr on disease diagnosis and treatment need further investigation.", "journal": ["Neural regeneration research", "Neural Regen Res"], "id": "29090003", "doi": "10.4103/1673-5374.215268", "date": null, "authors": [["Zou", "Yan", "Y", "Department of Neurology, The Second People's Hospital of Wuxi, Wuxi, Jiangsu Province, China."], ["Zhang", "Wei-Feng", "WF", "Department of Neurology, The Second People's Hospital of Wuxi, Wuxi, Jiangsu Province, China."], ["Liu", "Hai-Ying", "HY", "Department of Neurology, The Second People's Hospital of Wuxi, Wuxi, Jiangsu Province, China."], ["Li", "Xia", "X", "Department of Neurology, The Second People's Hospital of Wuxi, Wuxi, Jiangsu Province, China."], ["Zhang", "Xing", "X", "Department of Neurology, The Second People's Hospital of Wuxi, Wuxi, Jiangsu Province, China."], ["Ma", "Xiao-Fang", "XF", "Department of Neurology, The Second People's Hospital of Wuxi, Wuxi, Jiangsu Province, China."], ["Sun", "Yang", "Y", "Department of Neurology, The Second People's Hospital of Wuxi, Wuxi, Jiangsu Province, China."], ["Jiang", "Shi-Yi", "SY", "Department of Neurology, The Second People's Hospital of Wuxi, Wuxi, Jiangsu Province, China."], ["Ma", "Quan-Hong", "QH", "Department of Neurology, The Second People's Hospital of Wuxi, Wuxi, Jiangsu Province, China."], ["Xu", "De-En", "DE", "Department of Neurology, The Second People's Hospital of Wuxi, Wuxi, Jiangsu Province, China."]]}
