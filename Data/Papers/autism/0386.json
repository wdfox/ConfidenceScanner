{"title": "Predictors of Satisfaction with Life in Parents of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.", "text": "This study examined the relationships between autism spectrum disorder (ASD) symptoms, care-related activities, and satisfaction with life (SWL) in 184 parents caring for a child with ASD in New Zealand. The relationships between coping styles and SWL were also examined. The parents' SWL scores indicated they were slightly dissatisfied with their lives. A stepwise linear regression showed three predictors (care-related health problems, carer esteem and financial difficulties) explained 47% of the variance in SWL scores. Several coping styles were associated with lowered SWL, and only emotional support was related to increased SWL. The regression model provides a focus for monitoring parental wellbeing, and stresses the importance of recognition and support for the substantial responsibilities parents of children with ASD face.", "journal": ["Journal of autism and developmental disorders", "J Autism Dev Disord"], "id": "29189918", "doi": "10.1007/s10803-017-3423-7", "date": "2017-11-30", "authors": [["Landon", "Jason", "J", "Department of Psychology, Faculty of Health & Environmental Sciences, Auckland University of Technology, 90 Akoranga Drive, Northcote, Auckland, 1142, New Zealand. jason.landon@aut.ac.nz."], ["Shepherd", "Daniel", "D", "Department of Psychology, Faculty of Health & Environmental Sciences, Auckland University of Technology, 90 Akoranga Drive, Northcote, Auckland, 1142, New Zealand."], ["Goedeke", "Sonja", "S", "Department of Psychology, Faculty of Health & Environmental Sciences, Auckland University of Technology, 90 Akoranga Drive, Northcote, Auckland, 1142, New Zealand."]]}
