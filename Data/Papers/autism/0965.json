{"title": "The determinants of service complexity in children with intellectual disabilities.", "text": "To date, little is known about the predictors of healthcare service utilisation in children with intellectual disability (ID). The aim of this study was to identify the factors associated with service complexity in children with ID in Ontario, Canada.The population of this cross-sectional study consisted of 330 children with ID ages 4 to 18\u00a0years who accessed mental health services from November of 2012 to June of 2016 in four agencies. All participants completed the interRAI Child and Youth Mental Health and Developmental Disability Assessment Instrument, which is a semi-structured clinician-rated assessment that covers a range of common issues in children with ID. The outcome of this study was a service complexity variable based on (1) mental health service utilisation including any services provided to the child and (2) the management involved in providing that care. Eight individual items were summed, resulting in a scale that ranged from 0 to 8. Scores were then dichotomised into two groups: a score of 0-2 identified children with a low service complexity and a score of 3 or higher identified children with a high service complexity.After adjustment for other covariates, gender was not associated with service complexity. Children aged 11-14\u00a0years and children with autism spectrum disorder used over twofold higher levels of service complexity than children aged equal to or less than 10\u00a0years or children with other causes of ID. Moreover, victims of bullying, high scores on the family functioning scale or learning or communication disorder were associated with greater service complexity.The findings of this study indicate that a variety of factors are related to service complexity ranged from children's nonclinical (age and experiences of bullying) to clinical (e.g. aggression, learning/communication problems and autism spectrum disorder) characteristics.", "journal": ["Journal of intellectual disability research : JIDR", "J Intellect Disabil Res"], "id": "29024219", "doi": "10.1111/jir.12423", "date": null, "authors": [["Stewart", "S L", "SL", "Faculty of Education, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada."], ["Falah Hassani", "K", "K", "Faculty of Education, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada."], ["Poss", "J", "J", "School of Public Health and Health Systems, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada."], ["Hirdes", "J", "J", "School of Public Health and Health Systems, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada."]]}
