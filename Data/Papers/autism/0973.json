{"title": "Challenges of Females with Autism: A Parental Perspective.", "text": "Most studies investigating the experiences and needs of individuals with ASD have largely focused on males. Hence, this study investigates parents' perspectives on the challenges that their daughters with ASD face. In total, 40 parents of 40 females with autism (age range\u2009=\u20094-29 years; mean\u2009=\u200915.9) participated in the study. Five separate, 2-h long focus groups were conducted, with 7-10 participants in each group. Field notes were analyzed using thematic analysis. Some of the issues parents discussed were similar to those experienced by males with ASD, such as challenges in social interactions. However, other issues discussed were of particular relevance to girls with ASD, including difficulties socializing with other girls, sex-specific puberty issues, barriers in accessing intervention and sexual vulnerability.", "journal": ["Journal of autism and developmental disorders", "J Autism Dev Disord"], "id": "29022174", "doi": "10.1007/s10803-017-3341-8", "date": "2017-10-11", "authors": [["Mademtzi", "Marilena", "M", "Child Study Center, School of Medicine, Yale University, 230 South Frontage, Room G70, New Haven, CT, 06510, USA. marilena.mademtzi@yale.edu."], ["Singh", "Pavita", "P", "School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA."], ["Shic", "Fred", "F", "Seattle Children's Hospital, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA."], ["Koenig", "Kathy", "K", "Child Study Center, School of Medicine, Yale University, 230 South Frontage, Room G70, New Haven, CT, 06510, USA."]]}
