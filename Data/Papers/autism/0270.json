{"title": "How do Parents Manage Irritability, Challenging Behaviour, Non-Compliance and Anxiety in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders? A Meta-Synthesis.", "text": "Although there is increasing research interest in the parenting of children with ASD, at present, little is known about everyday strategies used to manage problem behaviour. We conducted a meta-synthesis to explore what strategies parents use to manage irritability, non-compliance, challenging behaviour and anxiety in their children with ASD. Approaches included: (1) accommodating the child; (2) modifying the environment; (3) providing structure, routine and occupation; (4) supervision and monitoring; (5) managing non-compliance with everyday tasks; (6) responding to problem behaviour; (7) managing distress; (8) maintaining safety and (9) analysing and planning. Results suggest complex parenting demands in children with ASD and problem behaviour. Findings will inform the development of a new measure to quantify parenting strategies relevant to ASD.", "journal": ["Journal of autism and developmental disorders", "J Autism Dev Disord"], "id": "29222612", "doi": "10.1007/s10803-017-3361-4", "date": "2017-12-08", "authors": [["O'Nions", "Elizabeth", "E", "Parenting and Special Education Research Unit, Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences, KU Leuven, Leopold Vanderkelenstraat 32, P.
