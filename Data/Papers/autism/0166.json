{"title": "Angelman Syndrome Due to UBE3A Gene Mutation.", "text": "A 12-y-old boy presented with developmental delay, autism, epilepsy, limb tremors and behavioral problems which posed a diagnostic challenge. Though his clinical profile and electroencephalogram were suggestive of Angelman syndrome, initial genetic tests were unyielding. Exome sequencing revealed a previously unreported mutation of Ubiquitin Protein Ligase E3A (UBE3A) gene, confirming the diagnosis of Angelman syndrome. The case is aimed to sensitize pediatricians about Angelman syndrome and to highlight the role of sequential investigations in establishing the diagnosis.", "journal": ["Indian journal of pediatrics", "Indian J Pediatr"], "id": "29250725", "doi": "10.1007/s12098-017-2559-y", "date": "2017-12-18", "authors": [["Goswami", "Jyotindra Narayan", "JN", "Pediatric Neurology and Neurodevelopment Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education & Research, Chandigarh, 160012, India."], ["Sahu", "Jitendra Kumar", "JK", "Pediatric Neurology and Neurodevelopment Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education & Research, Chandigarh, 160012, India."], ["Singhi", "Pratibha", "P", "Pediatric Neurology and Neurodevelopment Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education & Research, Chandigarh, 160012, India. doctorpratibhasinghi@gmail.com."]]}
