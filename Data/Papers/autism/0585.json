The sample consisted of two groups; a study group (SG) of 150 ASD children, and a control group (CG) of age- and gender-matched 150 healthy children. The parents of the children in both the groups were administered a questionnaire that included questions about the children's demographic information and previous or persistent oral habits.The prevalence of oral habits was higher (87.3%) among the SG children as compared to CG children (49.3%). The most prevalent oral habit among the SG was bruxism (n = 82; 54.7%), followed by object biting (n = 67; 44.7%) and mouth breathing (n = 40; 26.7 %). Among the CG; the most prevalent oral habit was mouth breathing (n = 40; 26.7%) followed by nail biting (n=18; 12%) and object biting (n = 7; 4.7%). The prevalence of bruxism, object biting, thumb sucking and tongue biting was significantly (p<0.05) higher in the SG than the CG.The prevalence of oral habits was higher in the ASD group children than the healthy children.", "journal": ["Pakistan journal of medical sciences", "Pak J Med Sci"], "id": "29142556", "doi": "10.12669/pjms.335.13554", "date": null, "authors": [["Al-Sehaibany", "Fares S", "FS", "Fares S.
