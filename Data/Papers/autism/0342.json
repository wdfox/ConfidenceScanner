{"title": "Development of Attention to Faces during the First 3 Years: Influences of Stimulus Type.", "text": "The development of attention toward faces was explored during the first 3 years of life in 54 children aged between 3 and 36 months. In contrast to previous research, attention to faces was assessed using both static images and a dynamic video sequence in the same participants. Separate analyses at each age and exploratory longitudinal analyses indicate a preference for faces during the first year, followed by a decline during the second year. These results suggest that attention to faces does not follow a linear increasing pattern over development, and that social attention patterns are influenced by stimulus characteristics.", "journal": ["Frontiers in psychology", "Front Psychol"], "id": "29204130", "doi": "10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01976", "date": "2017-11-17", "authors": [["Libertus", "Klaus", "K", "Learning Research and Development Center, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, United States."], ["Landa", "Rebecca J", "RJ", "Center for Autism and Related Disorders, Kennedy Krieger Institute, Baltimore, MD, United States."], ["Haworth", "Joshua L", "JL", "Science & Learning Center, Whittier College, Whittier, CA, United States."]]}
