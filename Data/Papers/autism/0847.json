{"title": "An exploration of common dopaminergic variants and behavior problems in siblings at high risk for autism spectrum disorder.", "text": "Younger siblings of children with ASD often exhibit elevated internalizing and externalizing problems. We investigated common dopaminergic variants (DRD4 and DRD2) in relation to behavior problems at 36 months. Genotypes linked to less efficient dopaminergic functioning were associated with higher internalizing problems in high-risk siblings.", "journal": ["Infant behavior & development", "Infant Behav Dev"], "id": "29054034", "doi": "10.1016/j.infbeh.2017.10.002", "date": "2017-10-17", "authors": [["Gangi", "Devon N", "DN", "MIND Institute, University of California, Davis, UC Davis Medical Center, 2825 50(th) Street, Sacramento, CA 95817, USA.
