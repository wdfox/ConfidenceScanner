{"title": "A Sibling-Mediated Intervention for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder: Using the Natural Language Paradigm (NLP).", "text": "We taught three typically developing siblings to occasion speech by implementing the Natural Language Paradigm (NLP) with their brothers with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A non-concurrent multiple baseline design across children with ASD and sibling dyads was used. Ancillary behaviors of happiness, play, and joint attention for the children with ASD were recorded. Generalization of speech for the children with ASD across setting and peers was also measured. During baseline, the children with ASD displayed few target speech behaviors and the siblings inconsistently occasioned speech from their brothers. After sibling training, however, they successfully delivered NLP, and in turn, for two of the brothers with ASD, speech reached criterion. Implications of this research suggest the inclusion of siblings in interventions.", "journal": ["Journal of autism and developmental disorders", "J Autism Dev Disord"], "id": "29170941", "doi": "10.1007/s10803-017-3404-x", "date": "2017-11-23", "authors": [["Spector", "Vicki", "V", "Claremont Graduate University, 150 E. 10th St., Claremont, CA, 91711, USA. vicki.spector@cgu.edu."], ["Charlop", "Marjorie H", "MH", "Claremont McKenna College, 850 Columbia Ave, Claremont, CA, 91711, USA."]]}
