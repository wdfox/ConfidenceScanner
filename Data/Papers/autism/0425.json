{"title": "Parent-Implemented Bedtime Fading and Positive Routines for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders.", "text": "Sleep disorders affect a large portion of those with autism spectrum disorder. Behavioural interventions have been found to increase appropriate sleep behaviours. This study sought to examine the efficacy of two stimulus control interventions (bedtime fading and positive routines) on total sleep duration, sleep onset latency and frequency and duration of night wakings for children with autism using two multiple baseline designs. Secondary dependent variables, namely, educational opportunities, challenging behaviours, parent acceptance and social validity were also analysed. Results suggest some efficacy for both interventions. Increased total sleep duration and decreased sleep onset latency were achieved with bedtime fading. Positive routines showed mixed results with decreased sleep onset latency and increased total sleep duration for two of three participants.", "journal": ["Journal of autism and developmental disorders", "J Autism Dev Disord"], "id": "29177618", "doi": "10.1007/s10803-017-3398-4", "date": "2017-11-24", "authors": [["Delemere", "Emma", "E", "School of Social Sciences, Education & Social Work, Queen's University Belfast, 69-71 University Street, Belfast, BT7 1HL, Northern Ireland, UK."], ["Dounavi", "Katerina", "K", "School of Social Sciences, Education & Social Work, Queen's University Belfast, 69-71 University Street, Belfast, BT7 1HL, Northern Ireland, UK. k.dounavi@qub.ac.uk."]]}
