{"title": "An Evaluation of a Social Skills Intervention for Adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder and Intellectual Disabilities preparing for Employment in Ireland: A Pilot Study.", "text": "Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are faced with significant barriers relating to employment opportunities and workplace participation. This study evaluated the effectiveness of the Walker social skills curriculum: the ACCESS program and video modeling to increase social communication skills necessary for workplace inclusion. Participants attended two sessions (i.e., 3\u00a0h) per week across a period of 20\u00a0weeks. A multiple-probe design was used to demonstrate social skills outcomes across three broad curricular areas (i.e., peer-related, adult-related, and self-related social skills). Pre-and post-intervention standardized assessments were also taken. Results showed significant increases in target social skills and a significant decrease in problem behaviors following intervention. Evidence of maintenance and generalization were also demonstrated. Implications for practice and research are discussed.", "journal": ["Journal of autism and developmental disorders", "J Autism Dev Disord"], "id": "29224188", "doi": "10.1007/s10803-017-3441-5", "date": "2017-12-09", "authors": [["Walsh", "Edith", "E", "School of Psychology, National University of Ireland, Galway, Ireland."], ["Holloway", "Jennifer", "J", "School of Psychology, National University of Ireland, Galway, Ireland. jennifer.holloway@nuigalway.ie."], ["Lydon", "Helena", "H", "School of Psychology, National University of Ireland, Galway, Ireland."]]}
