{"title": "Brief Report: Physical Activity, Body Mass Index and Arterial Stiffness in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder: Preliminary Findings.", "text": "We examined the association between physical activity (PA), body mass index (BMI) and novel measures of subclinical cardiovascular disease (CVD) in 15 children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (mean age 7\u2009\u00b1\u20092 years, 2 girls). PA was objectively assessed using accelerometry as time spent in moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Arterial stiffness was measured via aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) and taken as a marker of subclinical CVD risk. MVPA was inversely associated with aortic PWV (r = -\u20090.46, p\u2009<\u20090.05). BMI percentile was positively associated with aortic PWV (r\u2009=\u20090.61, p\u2009<\u20090.05). Overall findings suggest that reduced PA and higher body mass in children with ASD are associated with increased arterial stiffness which may have a detrimental impact on overall cardiovascular health.", "journal": ["Journal of autism and developmental disorders", "J Autism Dev Disord"], "id": "29119519", "doi": "10.1007/s10803-017-3358-z", "date": "2017-11-08", "authors": [["Heffernan", "Kevin S", "KS", "Department of Exercise Science, Human Performance Laboratory, Syracuse University, 820 Comstock Ave, Room 201, Syracuse, NY, 13244, USA. ksheffer@syr.edu."], ["Columna", "Luis", "L", "Department of Exercise Science, Physical Education, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, USA."], ["Russo", "Natalie", "N", "Department of Psychology, Center for Autism and Electrophysiology Laboratory, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, USA."], ["Myers", "Beth A", "BA", "Department of Teaching and Leadership, Taishoff Center for Inclusive Higher Education, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, USA."], ["Ashby", "Christine E", "CE", "Department of Teaching and Leadership, Institute on Communication and Inclusion, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, USA."], ["Norris", "Michael L", "ML", "Department of Exercise Science, Physical Education, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, USA."], ["Barreira", "Tiago V", "TV", "Department of Exercise Science, Human Behavior Measurement Laboratory, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, USA."]]}
