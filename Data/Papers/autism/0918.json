{"title": "Do Low Serum UCH-L1 and TDP-43 Levels Indicate Disturbed Ubiquitin-Proteosome System in Autism Spectrum Disorder?", "text": "The mechanism of ubiquitination-related abnormalities causing neural development problems is still unclear. We examined the association between autism and serum transactive response DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43) and ubiquitin c-terminal hydrolase-L1 (UCH-L1) levels, both of which are members of the ubiquitin-proteosome system.We measured serum levels of TDP-43 and UCH-L1 in 24 children with autism and 24 healthy children. Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) was used to assess symptom severity at admission.The mean serum TDP-43 and UCH-L1 levels in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) were found to decrease compared to healthy controls (p<0.001, 506.21\u00b1780.97 ng/L and 1245.80\u00b1996.76 ng/L, respectively; 3.08\u00b15.44 ng/mL and 8.64\u00b16.67 ng/mL, respectively). A positive correlation between serum TDP-43 levels and UCH-L1 levels was found in the ASD group (r=0.947, n=24, p<0.001). The CARS score of children with ASD was 48.91 points (standard deviation [SD]: 5.82).Low serum levels of UCH-L1 and TDP-43 may reflect disturbed ubiquitination in autism.", "journal": ["Noro psikiyatri arsivi", "Noro Psikiyatr Ars"], "id": "29033641", "doi": "10.5152/npa.2017.14873", "date": "2017-04-19", "authors": [["\u00c7etin", "\u0130hsan", "\u0130", "Department of Nutrition and Dietetics, Batman University School of Health, Batman, Turkey."], ["Tezdi\u011f", "\u0130hsan", "\u0130", "Department of Chemistry, Batman University Institute of Science, Batman, Turkey."], ["Tarak\u00e7io\u011flu", "Mahmut Cem", "MC", "Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Kanuni Sultan S\u00fcleyman Training and Research Hospital, \u0130stanbul, Turkey."], ["Kadak", "Muhammed Tayyib", "MT", "Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, \u0130stanbul University Cerrahpa\u015fa School of Medicine, \u0130stanbul, Turkey."], ["Demirel", "\u00d6mer Faruk", "\u00d6F", "Department of Psychiatry, \u0130stanbul University Cerrahpa\u015fa School of Medicine, \u0130stanbul, Turkey."], ["\u00d6zer", "\u00d6mer Faruk", "\u00d6F", "Department of Biochemistry, Bezmialem Vakif University School of Medicine, \u0130stanbul, Turkey."], ["Erdo\u011fan", "F\u0131rat", "F", "Department of Pediatrics, Medipol University School of Medicine, \u0130stanbul, Turkey."], ["Do\u011fang\u00fcn", "Burak", "B", "Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, \u0130stanbul University Cerrahpa\u015fa School of Medicine, \u0130stanbul, Turkey."]]}
