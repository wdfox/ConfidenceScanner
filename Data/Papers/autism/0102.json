{"title": "The Effects of a Peer-Delivered Social Skills Intervention for Adults with Comorbid Down Syndrome and Autism Spectrum Disorder.", "text": "Deficits in social skills are often exhibited in individuals with comorbid Down syndrome (DS) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and there is a paucity of research to help guide intervention for this population. In the present study, a multiple probe study across behaviors, replicated across participants, assessed the effectiveness of peer-delivered simultaneous prompting in teaching socials skills to adults with DS-ASD using visual analysis techniques and Tau-U statistics to measure effect. Peer-mediators with DS and intellectual disability (ID) delivered simultaneous prompting sessions reliably (i.e., >\u200980% reliability) to teach social skills to adults with ID and a dual-diagnoses of DS-ASD with small (Tau Weighted \u2009=\u2009.55, 90% CI [.29, .82]) to medium effects (Tau Weighted \u2009=\u2009.75, 90% CI [.44, 1]). Statistical and visual analysis findings suggest a promising social skills intervention for individuals with DS-ASD as well as reliable delivery of simultaneous prompting procedures by individuals with DS.", "journal": ["Journal of autism and developmental disorders", "J Autism Dev Disord"], "id": "29274009", "doi": "10.1007/s10803-017-3437-1", "date": "2017-12-22", "authors": [["Davis", "Matthew A Cody", "MAC", "Department of Educational, School, and Counseling Psychology, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, 40506-0017, USA. cdavis@stewarthome.com."], ["Spriggs", "Amy", "A", "Department of Early Childhood, Special Education and Rehabilitation Counseling, University of Kentucky, Lexington, USA."], ["Rodgers", "Alexis", "A", "Department of Educational, School, and Counseling Psychology, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, 40506-0017, USA."], ["Campbell", "Jonathan", "J", "Department of Educational, School, and Counseling Psychology, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, 40506-0017, USA."]]}
