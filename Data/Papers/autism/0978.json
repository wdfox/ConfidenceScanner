{"title": "A Program Evaluation of Home and Center-Based Treatment for Autism Spectrum Disorder.", "text": "The present study aimed to retrospectively compare the relative rates of mastery of exemplars for individuals with ASD (N\u00a0=\u00a0313) who received home-based and center-based services. A between-group analysis found that participants mastered significantly more exemplars per hour when receiving center-based services than home-based services. Likewise, a paired-sample analysis found that participants who received both home and center-based services had mastered 100\u00a0% more per hour while at the center than at home. These analyses indicated that participants demonstrated higher rates of learning during treatment that was provided in a center setting than in the participant's home.", "journal": ["Behavior analysis in practice", "Behav Anal Pract"], "id": "29021944", "doi": "10.1007/s40617-016-0155-7", "date": "2016-10-25", "authors": [["Dixon", "Dennis R", "DR", "Center for Autism and Related Disorders, 21600 Oxnard Street, Suite 1800, Woodland Hills, CA 91367 USA."], ["Burns", "Claire O", "CO", "Center for Autism and Related Disorders, 21600 Oxnard Street, Suite 1800, Woodland Hills, CA 91367 USA."], ["Granpeesheh", "Doreen", "D", "Center for Autism and Related Disorders, 21600 Oxnard Street, Suite 1800, Woodland Hills, CA 91367 USA."], ["Amarasinghe", "Roshan", "R", "Center for Autism and Related Disorders, 21600 Oxnard Street, Suite 1800, Woodland Hills, CA 91367 USA."], ["Powell", "Alva", "A", "Center for Autism and Related Disorders, 21600 Oxnard Street, Suite 1800, Woodland Hills, CA 91367 USA."], ["Linstead", "Erik", "E", "Chapman University, Schmid College of Science and Technology, One University Drive, Orange, CA 92866 USA."]]}
