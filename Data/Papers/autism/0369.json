{"title": "School Age Outcomes of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder Who Received Community-Based Early Interventions.", "text": "This study followed children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) from early intervention into their early schooling years, when they were aged between 6 and 9\u00a0years, on autism symptom severity and cognitive functioning. The children, matched at pre-intervention, were compared on type of community provided service: 31 were in receipt of community-based group Early Start Denver Model and 28 had received other community provisions for ASD. Irrespective of groups, cognitive functioning was found to have significantly improved by school age compared to pre-intervention. Autism symptom severity increased during the same developmental period, seemingly driven by an increase in restricted and repetitive behaviours over time. In contrast, both groups displayed improved social affect by school age.", "journal": ["Journal of autism and developmental disorders", "J Autism Dev Disord"], "id": "29196863", "doi": "10.1007/s10803-017-3414-8", "date": "2017-12-01", "authors": [["Vinen", "Zoe", "Z", "Olga Tennison Autism Research Centre, La Trobe University, Bundoora Campus, Melbourne, VIC, 3086, Australia."], ["Clark", "Megan", "M", "Olga Tennison Autism Research Centre, La Trobe University, Bundoora Campus, Melbourne, VIC, 3086, Australia."], ["Paynter", "Jessica", "J", "Griffith University, Nathan, QLD, Australia."], ["Dissanayake", "Cheryl", "C", "Olga Tennison Autism Research Centre, La Trobe University, Bundoora Campus, Melbourne, VIC, 3086, Australia. c.dissanayake@latrobe.edu.au."]]}
