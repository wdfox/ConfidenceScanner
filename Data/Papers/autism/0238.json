{"title": "Poor Convergence: College Students' Definitions and Free-Poured Volumes of Standard Alcohol Servings.", "text": "We examined the correspondence between college students' ( N\u2009=\u2009192, 71% women) definitions of free-pours and their free-poured volumes of beer, wine, and liquor. Participants' mean beer definitions and free-pours were positively correlated; participants' mean wine and liquor definitions were larger than their free-pours, which were fairly accurate. Contrary to what the aggregate mean values indicated, fewer than half of the participants accurately free-poured a standard volume of beer, wine, or liquor (37.4%, 35.1%, and 22.2%, respectively) or provided an accurate definition of beer (45.8%); similar to the aggregate data, few participants provided accurate definitions of standard serving of wine (12.2%) or liquor (12.8%) Instead, a majority of participants' definitions and free-pours were well over or under a standard serving. For all three types of alcohol, there was little correspondence between each individual participant's definitions and his or her free-poured volumes. These data suggest analyses of individual data points may provide information important for data collection, prevention, and intervention strategies.", "journal": ["Journal of drug education", "J Drug Educ"], "id": "29231063", "doi": "10.1177/0047237917744329", "date": "2017-01-01", "authors": [["Kohn", "Carolynn S", "CS", "1 Department of Psychology, University of the Pacific, Stockton, CA, USA."], ["Schultz", "Nicole R", "NR", "2 Department of Psychology, 1383 Auburn University , AL, USA."], ["Bettencourt", "Katrina", "K", "3 A Hope For Autism Foundation, OR, USA."], ["Dunn Carlton", "Heather", "H", "4 Division of Student Life, University of the Pacific, Stockton, CA, USA."]]}
