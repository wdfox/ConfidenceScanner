{"title": "The GapMap project: a mobile surveillance system to map diagnosed autism cases and gaps in autism services globally.", "text": "Although the number of autism diagnoses is on the rise, we have no evidence-based tracking of size and severity of gaps in access to autism-related resources, nor do we have methods to geographically triangulate the locations of the widest gaps in either the US or elsewhere across the globe. To combat these related issues of (1) mapping diagnosed cases of autism and (2) quantifying gaps in access to key intervention services, we have constructed a crowd-based mobile platform called \"GapMap\" (http://gapmap.stanford.edu) for real-time tracking of autism prevalence and autism-related resources that can be accessed from any mobile device with cellular or wireless connectivity. Now in beta, our aim is for this Android/iOS compatible mobile tool to simultaneously crowd-enroll the massive and growing community of families with autism to capture geographic, diagnostic, and resource usage information while automatically computing prevalence at granular geographical scales to yield a more complete and dynamic understanding of autism resource epidemiology.", "journal": ["Molecular autism", "Mol Autism"], "id": "29075431", "doi": "10.1186/s13229-017-0163-7", "date": "2017-10-23", "authors": [["Daniels", "Jena", "J", "Department of Pediatrics, Division of Systems Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA USA."], ["Schwartz", "Jessey", "J", "Department of Pediatrics, Division of Systems Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA USA."], ["Albert", "Nikhila", "N", "Department of Pediatrics, Division of Systems Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA USA."], ["Du", "Michael", "M", "Department of Pediatrics, Division of Systems Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA USA."], ["Wall", "Dennis P", "DP", "Department of Pediatrics, Division of Systems Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA USA."]]}
