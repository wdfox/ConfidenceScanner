{"title": "Assessing Autism in Adults: An Evaluation of the Developmental, Dimensional and Diagnostic Interview-Adult Version (3Di-Adult).", "text": "We developed a brief, informant-report interview for assessing autism spectrum conditions (ASC) in adults, called the Developmental, Dimensional and Diagnostic Interview-Adult Version (3Di-Adult); and completed a preliminary evaluation. Informant reports were collected for participants with ASC (n\u2009=\u200939), a non-clinical comparison group (n\u2009=\u200929) and a clinical comparison group (n\u2009=\u200920) who had non-autistic mental health conditions. Mean administration time was 38\u00a0min (50\u00a0min for ASC). Internal consistency (\u03b1s\u2009\u2265\u20090.93) and inter-rater agreement (ICCs\u2009\u2265\u20090.99) were high. When discriminating ASC from non-ASC, the 3Di-Adult showed excellent sensitivity (95%) and specificity (92%). The 3Di-Adult shows promise as a psychometrically sound and time-efficient interview for collecting standardised informant reports for DSM-5 assessments of ASC in adults, in research and clinical practice.", "journal": ["Journal of autism and developmental disorders", "J Autism Dev Disord"], "id": "29116420", "doi": "10.1007/s10803-017-3321-z", "date": "2017-11-07", "authors": [["Mandy", "William", "W", "The Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, UK. w.mandy@ucl.ac.uk."], ["Clarke", "Kiri", "K", "The Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, UK."], ["McKenner", "Michele", "M", "The Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, UK."], ["Strydom", "Andre", "A", "The Division of Psychiatry, UCL, London, WC1E 6BT, UK."], ["Crabtree", "Jason", "J", "The Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, UK."], ["Lai", "Meng-Chuan", "MC", "Autism Research Centre, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, 18B Trumpington Road, Cambridge, CB2 8AH, UK."], ["Allison", "Carrie", "C", "Autism Research Centre, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, 18B Trumpington Road, Cambridge, CB2 8AH, UK."], ["Baron-Cohen", "Simon", "S", "Autism Research Centre, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, 18B Trumpington Road, Cambridge, CB2 8AH, UK."], ["Skuse", "David", "D", "Institute of Child Health, UCL, Guilford Street, London, WC1N 1EH, UK."]]}
