{"title": "Understanding parents' concerns about their children with autism taking public school transportation in Los Angeles County.", "text": "There are a number of recent US news media reports of children and youth with autism becoming lost, injured, or even dying while taking public school transportation, yet research on this problem is scarce. This ethnographic study examines the experiences of 14 parents whose children with autism take public school transportation in Los Angeles County. We present two case studies of children with autism being \"lost\" while in transit from school to home on the bus to (1) describe how the situation was experienced, responded to, and managed by the parents; (2) consider three interrelated themes that emerged from interviews with 14 parents, related to children's safety, independence, and participation, across multiple contexts and analytic levels; and (3) discuss the findings in relation to US news media reports of incidents involving children with autism on school buses to identify specific weaknesses in school transportation infrastructure, particularly in the context of privatization, that create conditions in which children with autism can \"fall through the cracks\" in potentially life-threatening ways. We argue that there is a critical need to address transportation accessibility for individuals on the autism spectrum to ensure their safety and support their independence and community participation.", "journal": ["Autism : the international journal of research and practice", "Autism"], "id": "29153001", "doi": "10.1177/1362361316680182", "date": "2017-02-01", "authors": [["Angell", "Amber M", "AM", "1 University of Southern California, USA."], ["Solomon", "Olga", "O", "1 University of Southern California, USA."]]}
