{"title": "Transposition of the great arteries - a phenotype associated with 16p11.2 duplications?", "text": "Genetic analyses of patients with transposition of the great arteries have identified rare copy number variations, suggesting that they may be significant to the aetiology of the disease. This paper reports the identification of a 16p11.2 microduplication, a variation that has yet to be reported in association with transposition of the great arteries. The 16p11.2 microduplication is associated with autism spectrum disorder and developmental delay, but with highly variable phenotypic effects. Autism and attention deficit disorders are observed more frequently in children with congenital heart disease than in the general population. Neonatal surgery is proposed as a risk factor, but as yet unidentified genetic abnormalities should also be taken into account. Thus, congenital heart abnormalities may constitute a part of the phenotypic spectrum associated with duplications at 16p11.2. We suggest chromosomal microarray be considered part of the diagnostic work-up in patients with transposition of the great arteries.", "journal": ["World journal of cardiology", "World J Cardiol"], "id": "29317992", "doi": "10.4330/wjc.v9.i12.848", "date": null, "authors": [["Karunanithi", "Zarmiga", "Z", "Department of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus N 8200, Denmark."], ["Vestergaard", "Else Marie", "EM", "Department of Clinical Genetics, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus N 8200, Denmark."], ["Lauridsen", "Mette H", "MH", "Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus N 8200, Denmark. lauridsen.mette@auh.rm.dk."]]}
