{"title": "Analysis of Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) Screening for Children Less Than Age 4.", "text": "The Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) is a screener for Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) validated for age 4.0\u00a0+. There is a clinical need for an ASD screener for children beyond the 30-month age limit of the M-CHAT-R/F. We evaluate the literature on the use of the SCQ in children <\u00a04.0\u00a0years.Recent studies have used very large samples; included typically developing children, rather than just those with developmental disorders; compared the SCQ Lifetime and Current versions; and increased scrutiny of internal validity.The sensitivity-specificity balance in distinguishing between ASD and other developmental disorders is poor, which has led to development of abbreviated versions of the SCQ; however, sensitivity-specificity balance is better in a more general population. The SCQ Lifetime (not Current) version should be used. Future research relating should focus on further validation of the SCQ as a screener for children 30-48\u00a0months.", "journal": ["Current developmental disorders reports", "Curr Dev Disord Rep"], "id": "29188169", "doi": "10.1007/s40474-017-0122-1", "date": "2017-11-04", "authors": [["Marvin", "Alison R", "AR", "Department of Medical Informatics, Kennedy Krieger Institute, 3825 Greenspring Avenue, Baltimore, MD 21209 USA."], ["Marvin", "Daniel J", "DJ", "Department of Medical Informatics, Kennedy Krieger Institute, 3825 Greenspring Avenue, Baltimore, MD 21209 USA."], ["Lipkin", "Paul H", "PH", "Department of Medical Informatics, Kennedy Krieger Institute, 3825 Greenspring Avenue, Baltimore, MD 21209 USA."], ["Law", "J Kiely", "JK", "Department of Medical Informatics, Kennedy Krieger Institute, 3825 Greenspring Avenue, Baltimore, MD 21209 USA."]]}
