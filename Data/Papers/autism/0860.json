{"title": "Altered behavioral and amygdala habituation in high-functioning adults with autism spectrum disorder: an fMRI study.", "text": "Habituation to repeatedly presented stimuli is an important adaptive property of the nervous system. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been associated with reduced neural habituation, for example in the amygdala, which may be related to social impairments. The main focus of this study was to investigate habituation effects on the level of behavioral responses as well as amygdala responses in adults with ASD during a working memory task flanked by task-irrelevant face stimuli. Twenty-two patients with high-functioning autism and 24 healthy controls (HC) were included in this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study. We employed an established habituation index to investigate habituation effects. Suggestive of altered habituation, the habituation index showed a decrement of reaction time over the course of the experiment in the HC but not in the ASD group. Similarly, an expected pattern of habituation was evident in amygdala activation in HC but absent in ASD participants. These results provide evidence that habituation may be altered not only on a neural, but also on a behavioral level in ASD. While more research is needed to develop a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms, the current findings support the possibility that deficient habituation may be a biomarker of ASD.", "journal": ["Scientific reports", "Sci Rep"], "id": "29051601", "doi": "10.1038/s41598-017-14097-2", "date": "2017-10-19", "authors": [["Tam", "Friederike I", "FI", "Division of Psychological and Social Medicine and Developmental Neurosciences, Faculty of Medicine, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Fetscherstra\u00dfe 74, 01307, Dresden, Germany."], ["King", "Joseph A", "JA", "Division of Psychological and Social Medicine and Developmental Neurosciences, Faculty of Medicine, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Fetscherstra\u00dfe 74, 01307, Dresden, Germany."], ["Geisler", "Daniel", "D", "Division of Psychological and Social Medicine and Developmental Neurosciences, Faculty of Medicine, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Fetscherstra\u00dfe 74, 01307, Dresden, Germany."], ["Korb", "Franziska M", "FM", "Department of Psychology, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Zellescher Weg 17, 01069, Dresden, Germany."], ["Sareng", "Juliane", "J", "Division of Psychological and Social Medicine and Developmental Neurosciences, Faculty of Medicine, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Fetscherstra\u00dfe 74, 01307, Dresden, Germany."], ["Ritschel", "Franziska", "F", "Division of Psychological and Social Medicine and Developmental Neurosciences, Faculty of Medicine, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Fetscherstra\u00dfe 74, 01307, Dresden, Germany."], ["Steding", "Julius", "J", "Division of Psychological and Social Medicine and Developmental Neurosciences, Faculty of Medicine, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Fetscherstra\u00dfe 74, 01307, Dresden, Germany."], ["Albertowski", "Katja U", "KU", "Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, University Hospital C.
