Of more than 11,000 abstracts and 86 articles that were considered, only 4 met the criteria and were included in this review. Studies of parental training and coaching for children with challenges in SP-SI and comorbid autism spectrum disorder have suggested that educational or coaching programs could result in positive outcomes for both parents and children, often in a relatively short time period. Recommendations include a greater focus on providing educational interventions for parents and teachers and including specific assessment of SP-SI before implementing interventions meant to address those issues.
