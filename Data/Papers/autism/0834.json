{"title": "The Relation Between Walking and Language in Infant Siblings of Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder.", "text": "In typical development, walk onset is accompanied by increased language growth (e.g., Walle & Campos, 2014). The present study explored whether this relation may be disrupted in the infant siblings of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD; heightened risk of receiving an ASD diagnosis; HR), a population exhibiting substantial variability in motor and language development (e.g., Gamliel, Yirmiya, & Sigman, 2007; Landa & Garrett-Mayer, 2006). Receptive and expressive language were examined across the transition to walking in three groups of HR infants (no diagnosis, language delay, and ASD; N\u00a0=\u00a091, 8-18\u00a0months) and in infants with no family history of ASD (N\u00a0=\u00a025; 9-15\u00a0months). Only infants with an eventual ASD diagnosis did not show increased language growth following walk onset.", "journal": ["Child development", "Child Dev"], "id": "29058782", "doi": "10.1111/cdev.12980", "date": "2017-10-23", "authors": [["West", "Kelsey L", "KL", "University of Pittsburgh."], ["Leezenbaum", "Nina B", "NB", "University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill."], ["Northrup", "Jessie B", "JB", "University of Pittsburgh."], ["Iverson", "Jana M", "JM", "University of Pittsburgh."]]}
