{"title": "Automated Detection of Repetitive Motor Behaviors as an Outcome Measurement in Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities.", "text": "Repetitive sensory motor behaviors are a direct target for clinical treatment and a potential treatment endpoint for individuals with intellectual or developmental disabilities. By removing the burden associated with video annotation or direct observation, automated detection of stereotypy would allow for longer term monitoring in ecologic settings. We report automated detection of common stereotypical motor movements using commercially available accelerometers affixed to the body and a generalizable detection algorithm. The method achieved a sensitivity of 80% for body rocking and 93% for hand flapping without individualized algorithm training or foreknowledge of subject's specific movements. This approach is well-suited for implementation in a continuous monitoring system outside of a clinical setting.", "journal": ["Journal of autism and developmental disorders", "J Autism Dev Disord"], "id": "29164446", "doi": "10.1007/s10803-017-3408-6", "date": "2017-11-21", "authors": [["Gilchrist", "Kristin H", "KH", "RTI International, 3040 E.
