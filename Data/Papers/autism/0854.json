{"title": "Profiling Autism Symptomatology: An Exploration of the Q-ASC Parental Report Scale in Capturing Sex Differences in Autism.", "text": "The Questionnaire for Autism Spectrum Conditions (Q-ASC) was developed by Attwood et al. (2011) to identify gender-sensitive profiles of autism symptomatology; prioritise and adjust the direction of clinical interventions; and support positive psychosocial outcomes and prognosis into adulthood. The current research piloted the Q-ASC with parents of 238 children with a clinical diagnosis of ASD-Level 1 (without intellectual or language impairment). Data analysis revealed eight interpretable and reliable components of the Q-ASC using Principle components analysis. Comparisons across age and gender groups found statistically significant mean differences of parent-reported characteristics. The findings from this study aim to identify improvements in the Q-ASC towards the future assessment of the sensitivity and diversity of presentations of autism among female children and adolescents.", "journal": ["Journal of autism and developmental disorders", "J Autism Dev Disord"], "id": "29052806", "doi": "10.1007/s10803-017-3324-9", "date": "2017-10-20", "authors": [["Ormond", "Sarah", "S", "School of Psychology and Counselling, University of Southern Queensland, Toowoomba, Australia."], ["Brownlow", "Charlotte", "C", "School of Psychology and Counselling, University of Southern Queensland, Toowoomba, Australia.
