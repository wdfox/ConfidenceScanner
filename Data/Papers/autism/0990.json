{"title": "Parents' and young adults' perspectives on transition outcomes for young adults with autism.", "text": "Existing research shows that young adults with autism spectrum disorder have poorer outcomes than their peers with other developmental disabilities in the key areas of independent living, postsecondary education, and employment. However, we understand little about how young adults with autism and their families understand and value outcomes and whether these indicators match their goals and aspirations. We interviewed parents (n\u2009=\u200921) and young adults with autism spectrum disorder (n\u2009=\u200920) about their experiences with the transition to adulthood to understand what they consider to be desirable outcomes and how they seek to achieve them. Understanding these perspectives will help identify areas of need as well as disconnections between service objectives and the goals of young adults and their families. Participants described outcomes as more complex and nuanced than current conceptions and measures account for. They defined and evaluated outcomes in relation to their or their child's individual abilities, needs, and desires. These findings provide important insight into challenges to and facilitators of desired outcomes, which has implications for programming, service delivery, and policy.", "journal": ["Autism : the international journal of research and practice", "Autism"], "id": "29020791", "doi": "10.1177/1362361317699585", "date": "2017-10-11", "authors": [["Sosnowy", "Collette", "C", "Drexel University, USA."], ["Silverman", "Chloe", "C", "Drexel University, USA."], ["Shattuck", "Paul", "P", "Drexel University, USA."]]}
