{"title": "Establishing Concurrent Validity of the Role Checklist Version 2 with the OCAIRS in Measurement of Participation: A Pilot Study.", "text": "Persons experiencing problems with adaptation following disease, disability, or overwhelming life circumstances are often referred by their physicians to occupational therapists. Given time constraints, therapists may skip administration of a client-centered participation focused assessment and instead use an impairment or limitation focused assessment. This approach assumes that skill remediation will naturally lead to return of participation in valued occupational roles because most participation measures take 30 minutes or longer. In response to the need for an efficient measure of desired role participation, this study establishes concurrent validity of the 10-15-minute Role Checklist Version 2 (RCV2: QP) with the 50 minute Occupational Circumstances Assessment And Rating Scale (OCAIRS) in measuring occupational participation in individuals recovering from surgery following liver transplantation. 20 subjects (mean age of 55 and a mean time-since-transplant of 5.2 months) completed both instruments. The hypothesis was supported (r = .63), showing concurrent validity between the OCAIRS and the RCV2: QP. This provides therapists with an efficient, client-centered measure of occupational participation for a client-centered treatment plan. Using the RCV2: QP in place of the OCAIRS provides a more efficient assessment tool for occupational therapists to set treatment goals and monitor client progress over time.", "journal": ["Occupational therapy international", "Occup Ther Int"], "id": "29097976", "doi": "10.1155/2017/6493472", "date": "2017-01-22", "authors": [["Scott", "Patricia J", "PJ", "Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN, USA."], ["Cacich", "Danielle", "D", "Franciscan Health, Indianapolis, IN, USA."], ["Fulk", "Morgan", "M", "NCA Therapy, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA."], ["Michel", "Karen", "K", "Autism Treatment Center, San Antonio, TX, USA."], ["Whiffen", "Katie", "K", "Duke University Health System, Durham, NC, USA."]]}
