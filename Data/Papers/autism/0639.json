{"title": "Video modeling for the development of personal hygiene skills in youth with autism spectrum disorder.", "text": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder mainly characterised by deficits in social communication as well as by narrow patterns of behaviour and interests (American Psychiatric Association, 2013), often accompanied by language, intellectual and sensory impairments. The severity of these impairments may lead to deficits in the development of daily living activities such as simple meal preparation and feeding, community skills (e.g. buying groceries), personal care (e.g. dressing) and personal hygiene skills (bathing, toileting, hand washing, teeth brushing) needed for independence. Among others, the lack of independence in personal hygiene skills increases the burden of the caregiver and makes children with ASD more dependent (Flynn & Healy, 2012). Therefore, it is important to develop tools for helping individuals with ASD in increasing their ability to perform these basic life activities which will lead to savings that can be invested in other critical areas of needs.", "journal": ["Epidemiology and psychiatric sciences", "Epidemiol Psychiatr Sci"], "id": "29122040", "doi": "10.1017/S2045796017000610", "date": "2017-11-10", "authors": [["Piccin", "S", "S", "IRCCS \"Eugenio Medea\" Scientific Institute,San Vito al Tagliamento, Pordenone, Italy."], ["Crippa", "A", "A", "IRCCS \"Eugenio Medea\" Scientific Institute,Bosisio Parini, Lecco,Italy."], ["Nobile", "M", "M", "IRCCS \"Eugenio Medea\" Scientific Institute,Bosisio Parini, Lecco,Italy."], ["Hardan", "A Y", "AY", "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences,Stanford University,Stanford, CA,USA."], ["Brambilla", "P", "P", "Department of Neurosciences and Mental Health,Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, University of Milan,Milan,Italy."]]}
