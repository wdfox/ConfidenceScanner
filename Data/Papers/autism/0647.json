{"title": "Attention Training in Autism as a Potential Approach to Improving Academic Performance: A School-Based Pilot Study.", "text": "This study assessed the effectiveness of an attention intervention program (Computerized Progressive Attentional Training; CPAT) in improving academic performance of children with ASD. Fifteen 6-10\u00a0year olds with ASD attending a mainstream and a special school were assigned to an experimental (CPAT; n\u2009=\u20098) and active control (computer games; n\u2009=\u20097) group. Children were assessed pre- and post-intervention on measures of behavioural symptoms, cognitive skills and academic performance. The intervention was conducted in school twice a week for 8 weeks. Children in the CPAT group showed cognitive and academic improvements over and above the active control group, while children in both groups showed improvements in behaviour. Results suggest that attention training is a feasible approach to improving academic performance in this population.", "journal": ["Journal of autism and developmental disorders", "J Autism Dev Disord"], "id": "29119521", "doi": "10.1007/s10803-017-3371-2", "date": "2017-11-08", "authors": [["Spaniol", "Mayra Muller", "MM", "Department of Developmental Disorders, Universidade Presbiteriana Mackenzie, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. mayramspaniol@gmail.com."], ["Shalev", "Lilach", "L", "School of Education and the Sagol School of Neuroscience, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel."], ["Kossyvaki", "Lila", "L", "School of Education, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK."], ["Mevorach", "Carmel", "C", "School of Psychology, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK."]]}
