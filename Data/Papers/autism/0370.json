However, 128 isomers can be formed from DHA oxidation and among them, 4(RS)-4-F4t-NeuroP (4-F4t-NeuroP) and 10(RS)-10-F4t-NeuroP (10-F4t-NeuroP) are the most studied. Here, we report the identification and the clinical relevance of 4-F4t-NeuroP and 10-F4t-NeuroP in plasma of four different neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS), autism spectrum disorders (ASD), Rett syndrome (RTT), and Down syndrome (DS). The identification and the optimization of the method were carried out by gas chromatography/negative-ion chemical ionization tandem mass spectrometry (GC/NICI-MS/MS) using chemically synthesized 4-F4t-NeuroP and 10-F4t-NeuroP standards and in oxidized DHA liposome. Both 4-F4t-NeuroP and 10-F4t-NeuroP were detectable in all plasma samples from MS (n = 16), DS (n\u00a0= 16), ASD (n\u00a0= 9) and RTT (n = 20) patients. While plasma 10-F4t-NeuroP content was significantly higher in patients of all diseases as compared to age and gender matched healthy control subjects (n\u00a0= 61), 4-F4t-NeuroP levels were significantly higher in MS and RTT as compared to healthy controls. Significant positive relationships were observed between relative disease severity and 4-F4t-NeuroP levels (r = 0.469, P <0.0001), and 10-F4t-NeuroP levels (r = 0.757, P < 0.0001). The study showed that the plasma amount ratio of 10-F4t-NeuroP to 4-F4t-NeuroP and the plasma amount as individual isomer can be used to discriminate between different brain diseases. Overall, by comparing the different types of disease, our plasma data indicates that 4-F4t-NeuroP and 10-F4t -NeuroP: i) are biologically synthesized in vivo and circulated, ii) are related to clinical severity of neurological diseases, iii) are useful to identify shared pathogenetic pathways in distinct brain diseases, and iv) appears to be distinctive for different neurological conditions, thus representing potentially new biological disease markers.
