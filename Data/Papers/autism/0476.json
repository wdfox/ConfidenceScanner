{"title": "Mediating Parent Learning to Promote Social Communication for Toddlers with Autism: Effects from a Randomized Controlled Trial.", "text": "A randomized controlled trial was conducted to evaluate effects of the Joint Attention Mediated Learning (JAML) intervention. Toddlers with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) aged 16-30\u00a0months (n\u2009=\u2009144) were randomized to intervention and community control conditions. Parents, who participated in 32 weekly home-based sessions, followed a mediated learning process to target preverbal social communication outcomes (social visual synchrony, reciprocity, and responding and initiating forms of joint attention) throughout daily interactions. The analysis found post-intervention effects for all outcomes, with all except initiating joint attention sustaining 6\u00a0months post-intervention. Findings support the value of very early intervention targeting explicitly social functions of preverbal communication and of promoting active engagement in the learning process for both toddlers and parents.", "journal": ["Journal of autism and developmental disorders", "J Autism Dev Disord"], "id": "29168087", "doi": "10.1007/s10803-017-3386-8", "date": "2017-11-22", "authors": [["Schertz", "Hannah H", "HH", "Department of Curriculum & Instruction, Indiana University, 201 N Rose Ave., Bloomington, IN, 47405, USA. hschertz@indiana.edu."], ["Odom", "Samuel L", "SL", "Frank Porter Graham Child Development Institute, University of North Carolina, 105 Smith Level Road, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599, USA."], ["Baggett", "Kathleen M", "KM", "Mark Chaffin Center for Healthy Development, School of Public Health Georgia State University, 14 Marietta, Room 135, Atlanta, GA, 30303, USA."], ["Sideris", "John H", "JH", "Frank Porter Graham Child Development Institute, University of North Carolina, 105 Smith Level Road, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599, USA."]]}
