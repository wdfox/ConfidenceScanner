{"title": "Accelerometer-Assessed Physical Activity and Sedentary Time in Youth With Disabilities.", "text": "This study compared accelerometer-assessed habitual physical activity (PA), sedentary time, and meeting PA recommendations among 102 youth with disabilities (7-20 years) in four subgroups-physical/visual impairments, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorders, and hearing impairment-and 800 youth with typical development (8-16 years). Low proportions of youth with disabilities met PA recommendations, and they generally were less physically active and more sedentary than youth with typical development. The hearing impairment and autism spectrum disorder groups were the most and least physically active, respectively. Older age and to some extent female sex were related to less PA and more sedentary time. Considering the suboptimal levels of PA in youth with disabilities, effective interventions directed at factors associated with PA among them are needed.", "journal": ["Adapted physical activity quarterly : APAQ", "Adapt Phys Activ Q"], "id": "29072484", "doi": "10.1123/apaq.2015-0065", "date": "2017-10-26", "authors": [["Lobenius-Palm\u00e9r", "Karin", "K", "1 \u00d6rebro University."], ["Sj\u00f6qvist", "Birgitta", "B", "1 \u00d6rebro University."], ["Hurtig-Wennl\u00f6f", "Anita", "A", "1 \u00d6rebro University."], ["Lundqvist", "Lars-Olov", "LO", "1 \u00d6rebro University."]]}
