{"title": "The relation between emotional intelligence and resilience in at-risk populations.", "text": "Resilience factors and their relation to emotional intelligence (EI) as a potential strength for children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or high-functioning autism spectrum disorder (HFASD) were investigated. Children with either ADHD or HFASD were hypothesized to demonstrate reduced EI and differential relations between EI and resilience as compared to typically developing (TD) children.Fifty-four children aged 8-12\u00a0years (18 with ADHD, 18 with HFASD, and 18 TD controls) completed the Resilience Scales for Children and Adolescents and BarOn Emotional Quotient Inventory. Differences between groups (analysis of variance) and unique relations among the variables (correlation) for each group were examined.No group differences; however, unique relations between the variables were found within each sample.EI may be a unique area of interest for clinical populations and an important consideration in the development and implementation of interventions to capitalize upon inherent strengths. Implications of these results for intervention are discussed.", "journal": ["Developmental neurorehabilitation", "Dev Neurorehabil"], "id": "29083944", "doi": "10.1080/17518423.2017.1387873", "date": "2017-10-30", "authors": [["McCrimmon", "Adam W", "AW", "a Werklund School of Education , University of Calgary , Calgary , Alberta , Canada."], ["Climie", "Emma A", "EA", "a Werklund School of Education , University of Calgary , Calgary , Alberta , Canada."], ["Huynh", "Stephany", "S", "a Werklund School of Education , University of Calgary , Calgary , Alberta , Canada."]]}
