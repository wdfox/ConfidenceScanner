{"title": "Exercise Effects for Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder: Metabolic Health, Autistic Traits, and Quality of Life.", "text": "This study examined the effects of a 48-week exercise-based intervention on the metabolic profile, autism traits, and perceived quality of life in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We randomly allocated 64 children with ASD (aged 6-12 years) to experimental ( n\u2009=\u200946) and control groups ( n\u2009=\u200918) and used multilevel regression modeling to examine responses to receiving or not receiving the intervention. The experimental group showed beneficial effects on metabolic indicators (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and total cholesterol), autism traits, and parent-perceived quality of life. Our results provide support for exercise and physical activity, including basic coordination and strength exercises, as important therapeutic interventions for children with ASD.", "journal": ["Perceptual and motor skills", "Percept Mot Skills"], "id": "29226773", "doi": "10.1177/0031512517743823", "date": "2017-12-09", "authors": [["Toscano", "Chrystiane V A", "CVA", "1 Faculty of Physical Education, University of Coimbra, Portugal."], ["Carvalho", "Humberto M", "HM", "3 Faculty of Physical Education, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Florian\u00f3polis, SC, Brazil."], ["Ferreira", "Jos\u00e9 P", "JP", "1 Faculty of Physical Education, University of Coimbra, Portugal."]]}
