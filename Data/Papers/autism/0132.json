{"title": "Advantages and Challenges of a Home- and Clinic-Based Model of Behavioral Intervention for Individuals Diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder.", "text": "Researchers have demonstrated that comprehensive behavioral intervention can result in significant improvements in the lives of individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD; e.g.; Lovaas, Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology 55(1):3-9, 1987; McEachin et al., American Journal of Mental Retardation 97(4):359-372, 1993). This intervention has occurred in a variety of settings (e.g., school, home, and clinic). Even though procedures based upon the principles of applied behavior analysis (ABA) can be implemented across a variety of settings, there is often confusion about the differences and relative advantages of home- versus clinic-based settings. The purpose of this paper is to provide a discussion of home- and clinic-based intervention within the context of a progressive approach to ABA and discus possible advantages of each type of setting.", "journal": ["Journal of autism and developmental disorders", "J Autism Dev Disord"], "id": "29264680", "doi": "10.1007/s10803-017-3443-3", "date": "2017-12-20", "authors": [["Leaf", "Justin B", "JB", "Autism Partnership Foundation, 200 Marina Drive, Seal Beach, CA, 90740, USA.
