{"title": "Race influences parent report of concerns about symptoms of autism spectrum disorder.", "text": "Racial differences in parent report of concerns about their child's development to healthcare providers may contribute to delayed autism spectrum disorder diagnoses in Black children. We tested the hypotheses that compared to White parents, Black parents of children with autism spectrum disorder would report fewer concerns about autism symptoms and would be more likely to report concerns about disruptive behaviors. A sample of 18- to 40-month-old toddlers ( N\u2009=\u2009174) with autism spectrum disorder and their parent participated. After screening positive for autism spectrum disorder risk, but prior to a diagnostic evaluation, parents completed free-response questions soliciting concerns about their child's development. Parent responses were coded for the presence or the absence of 10 possible concerns, which were grouped into autism concerns (e.g. social and restricted and repetitive behavior concerns) or non-autism concerns (e.g. general developmental and disruptive behavior concerns). Compared to White parents, Black parents reported significantly fewer autism concerns and fewer social and restricted and repetitive behavior concerns. However, Black parents did not report significantly fewer non-autism concerns. Race did not influence parent report of disruptive behavior concerns. Lower reporting of autism concerns by Black parents may impact providers' abilities to identify children who need further screening or evaluation.", "journal": ["Autism : the international journal of research and practice", "Autism"], "id": "29100475", "doi": "10.1177/1362361317722030", "date": "2017-11-01", "authors": [["Donohue", "Meghan Rose", "MR", "1 Georgia State University, USA."], ["Childs", "Amber W", "AW", "2 Yale University, USA."], ["Richards", "Megan", "M", "3 Drexel University, USA."], ["Robins", "Diana L", "DL", "1 Georgia State University, USA."]]}
