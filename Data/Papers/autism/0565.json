{"title": "Please Wait, Processing: A Selective Literature Review of the Neurological Understanding of Emotional Processing in ASD and Its Potential Contribution to Neuroeducation.", "text": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and its corresponding conditions have been investigated from a multitude of perspectives resulting in varying understandings of its origin, its outplay, its prognosis, and potential methods of intervention and education for individuals with the disorder. One area that has contributed significantly to providing a different type of understanding is that of neuroscience, and specifically neuroimaging. This paper will offer a selective literature review of research that investigates the role of emotional processing in ASD, and how a deepening of this line of understanding can be used to inform more comprehensive educational practices.", "journal": ["Brain sciences", "Brain Sci"], "id": "29149018", "doi": "10.3390/brainsci7110153", "date": "2017-11-17", "authors": [["Shyman", "Eric", "E", "Child Study, St. Joseph's College, Patchogue, NY 11772, USA. eshyman@sjcny.edu."]]}
