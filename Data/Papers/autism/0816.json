{"title": "Dysregulated gene expressions of MEX3D, FOS and BCL2 in human induced-neuronal (iN) cells from NF1 patients: a pilot study.", "text": "Direct conversion technique to produce induced-neuronal (iN) cells from human fibroblasts within 2 weeks is expected to discover unknown neuronal phenotypes of neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we present unique gene expression profiles in iN cells from patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a single-gene multifaceted disorder with comparatively high co-occurrence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Microarray-based transcriptomic analysis on iN cells from male healthy controls and male NF1 patients (NF1-iN cells) revealed that 149 genes expressions were significantly different (110 upregulated and 39 downregulated). We validated that mRNA of MEX3D (mex-3 RNA binding family member D) was lower in NF1-iN cells by real-time PCR with 12 sex-mixed samples. In NF1-iN cells on day 14, higher expression of FOS mRNA was observed with lower expression of MEX3D mRNA. Interestingly, BCL2 mRNA was higher in NF1-iN cells on day 5 (early-period) but not on day 14. Our data suggest that aberrant molecular signals due to NF1 mutations may disturb gene expressions, a subset of which defines continuum of the neuronal phenotypes of NF1 with ASD. Further translational studies using induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived neuronal cells are needed to validate our preliminary findings especially confirming meanings of analysis using early-period iN cells.", "journal": ["Scientific reports", "Sci Rep"], "id": "29066822", "doi": "10.1038/s41598-017-14440-7", "date": "2017-10-24", "authors": [["Sagata", "Noriaki", "N", "Department of Neuropsychiatry, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Maidashi 3-1-1, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka, 812-8582, Japan."], ["Kato", "Takahiro A", "TA", "Department of Neuropsychiatry, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Maidashi 3-1-1, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka, 812-8582, Japan. takahiro@npsych.med.kyushu-u.ac.jp."], ["Kano", "Shin-Ichi", "SI", "Departments of Psychiatry, Mental Health, Neuroscience, and Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and Bloomberg School of Public Health, 600 North Wolfe St., Baltimore, MD 21287, USA."], ["Ohgidani", "Masahiro", "M", "Department of Neuropsychiatry, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Maidashi 3-1-1, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka, 812-8582, Japan."], ["Shimokawa", "Norihiro", "N", "Department of Neuropsychiatry, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Maidashi 3-1-1, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka, 812-8582, Japan."], ["Sato-Kasai", "Mina", "M", "Department of Neuropsychiatry, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Maidashi 3-1-1, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka, 812-8582, Japan."], ["Hayakawa", "Kohei", "K", "Department of Neuropsychiatry, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Maidashi 3-1-1, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka, 812-8582, Japan."], ["Kuwano", "Nobuki", "N", "Department of Neuropsychiatry, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Maidashi 3-1-1, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka, 812-8582, Japan."], ["Wilson", "Ashley M", "AM", "Departments of Psychiatry, Mental Health, Neuroscience, and Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and Bloomberg School of Public Health, 600 North Wolfe St., Baltimore, MD 21287, USA."], ["Ishizuka", "Koko", "K", "Departments of Psychiatry, Mental Health, Neuroscience, and Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and Bloomberg School of Public Health, 600 North Wolfe St., Baltimore, MD 21287, USA."], ["Kato", "Shiori", "S", "Department of Dermatology, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Maidashi 3-1-1, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka, 812-8582, Japan."], ["Nakahara", "Takeshi", "T", "Department of Dermatology, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Maidashi 3-1-1, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka, 812-8582, Japan."], ["Nakahara-Kido", "Makiko", "M", "Department of Dermatology, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Maidashi 3-1-1, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka, 812-8582, Japan."], ["Setoyama", "Daiki", "D", "Department of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Maidashi 3-1-1, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka, 812-8582, Japan."], ["Sakai", "Yasunari", "Y", "Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Maidashi 3-1-1, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka, 812-8582, Japan."], ["Ohga", "Shouichi", "S", "Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Maidashi 3-1-1, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka, 812-8582, Japan."], ["Furue", "Masutaka", "M", "Department of Dermatology, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Maidashi 3-1-1, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka, 812-8582, Japan."], ["Sawa", "Akira", "A", "Departments of Psychiatry, Mental Health, Neuroscience, and Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and Bloomberg School of Public Health, 600 North Wolfe St., Baltimore, MD 21287, USA."], ["Kanba", "Shigenobu", "S", "Department of Neuropsychiatry, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Maidashi 3-1-1, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka, 812-8582, Japan."]]}
