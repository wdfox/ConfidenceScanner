{"title": "Brief Report: Agreement Between Parents and Day-Care Professionals on Early Symptoms Associated with Autism Spectrum Disorders.", "text": "Early identification of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) has the potential to elicit effective early intervention, improving children's level of functioning and developmental trajectories as well as reducing parental stress. Multiple sources of information, including several informants may facilitate early identification. This study examined the agreement between parents and day-care professionals on how they retrospectively recall early symptoms associated with ASD. In this study, we found fair to excellent agreement on early symptoms between parents and day-care professionals. The finding indicates that day-care centres may be a supplementary area for early identification of ASD. More research is needed to explore day-care centers possible role in this early identification.", "journal": ["Journal of autism and developmental disorders", "J Autism Dev Disord"], "id": "29086212", "doi": "10.1007/s10803-017-3355-2", "date": "2017-10-30", "authors": [["Larsen", "Kenneth", "K", "Regional resource centre for autism, ADHD, Tourette\u00b4s syndrome and narcolepsy, Division of Paediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway. k_larsen@mac.com."], ["Aasland", "Astrid", "A", "Section of Psychosomatics and CL-Child Psychiatry, Department of Clinical Neurosciences for Children, Division of Paediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway."], ["Diseth", "Trond H", "TH", "Section of Psychosomatics and CL-Child Psychiatry, Department of Clinical Neurosciences for Children, Division of Paediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway."]]}
