{"title": "Utilizing PEAK Relational Training System to Teach Visual, Gustatory, and Auditory Relations to Adults with Developmental Disabilities.", "text": "Two multiple baseline designs were conducted across participants to determine if the promoting the emergence of advanced knowledge (PEAK) equivalence module was an effective tool in teaching adults with autism relationships between stimuli. More specifically, a transitivity program utilizing the gustatory sensory modality was implemented. Stimuli were selected and probed initially preceding the training. First, gustatory stimuli to a visual picture were trained. Then, a visual picture to a spoken word was trained. Finally, once mastery criterion was reached, each participant's responding was tested to determine whether there were derived relations following training. Results showed that all three participants reached mastery criterion in training sessions and were able to derive new relations without direct training.", "journal": ["Behavior analysis in practice", "Behav Anal Pract"], "id": "29021936", "doi": "10.1007/s40617-017-0194-8", "date": "2017-05-16", "authors": [["McKeel", "Autumn", "A", "Aurora University, Aurora, IL 60506 USA."], ["Matas", "Jaime", "J", "Aurora University, Aurora, IL 60506 USA."]]}
