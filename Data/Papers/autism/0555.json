This is the first reported case of a patient with fragile X syndrome with this Robertsonian translocation. Facial features and macroorchidism were consistent with fragile X syndrome. Cognitive impairment is more significant than in his sibling with fragile X syndrome, and the patient also has a prior diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. We emphasize the challenges in his behavioral management and outline future directions for his management.", "journal": ["Clujul medical (1957)", "Clujul Med"], "id": "29151796", "doi": "10.15386/cjmed-763", "date": "2017-10-20", "authors": [["Rachisan", "Andreea Liana", "AL", "Department of Pediatrics II, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania."], ["Niculae", "Alexandru Stefan", "AS", "Department of Pediatrics II, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania."], ["Tintea", "Ioana", "I", "Department of Pediatrics Neurology, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania."], ["Pop", "Bianca", "B", "Department of Pediatrics Psychiatry, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania."], ["Militaru", "Mariela", "M", "Department of Medical Genetics, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania."], ["Bizo", "Aurel", "A", "Department of Pediatrics I, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania."], ["Hrusca", "Adrian", "A", "Department of Medical Biophysics, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania."]]}
