{"title": "Structure Mapping in Autism Spectrum Disorder: Levels of Information Processing and Relations to Executive Functions.", "text": "Analogical reasoning was investigated among children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) without intellectual disabilities and typical development (TD). Children were asked to select one of two targets in two conditions: (1) with and without spatial structure similarity; (2) with and without a perceptual distractor. Results demonstrate that children with ASD were able to select targets based on structural similarity, but this ability decreased to chance level when presented with a perceptual distractor. Everyday executive functions were positively correlated with structural selections among children with ASD. Results suggest that although children with ASD were able to select based on systematicity principle, perceptual distractor decreased their selection so that their cognitive system produced less structure similarities, that negatively affects spatial analogical reasoning.", "journal": ["Journal of autism and developmental disorders", "J Autism Dev Disord"], "id": "29164441", "doi": "10.1007/s10803-017-3376-x", "date": "2017-11-21", "authors": [["Hetzroni", "Orit E", "OE", "Department of Special Education, Faculty of Education, University of Haifa, Mount Carmel, 31905, Haifa, Israel. hetzroni@edu.haifa.ac.il."], ["Shalahevich", "Kiril", "K", "Department of Special Education, Faculty of Education, University of Haifa, Mount Carmel, 31905, Haifa, Israel."]]}
