{"title": "A study of single nucleotide polymorphisms in CD157, AIM2 and JARID2 genes in Han Chinese children with autism spectrum disorder.", "text": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of developmental brain disorders caused by genetic and environmental factors. The objective of this study was to investigate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes related to immune function were associated with ASD in Chinese Han children.A total of 201 children with ASD and 200 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were recruited from September 2012 to June 2106. A TaqMan probe-based approach was used to genotype SNPs corresponding to rs28532698 and rs4301112 in CD157, rs855867 in AIM2, and rs2237126 in JARID2. Case-control and case-only studies were performed to determine the contribution of SNPs to the predisposition of disease and its severity, respectively.Our results revealed that the genotypes and allele frequencies of these SNPs were not significantly associated with childhood ASD and its severity in this population.Results of our study suggest that these SNPs are not predictors of childhood ASD in the Chinese Han population. The discrepant results suggest the predictor roles of SNPs have to be determined in different ethnic populations due to genetic heterogeneity of ASD.", "journal": ["Nordic journal of psychiatry", "Nord J Psychiatry"], "id": "29216786", "doi": "10.1080/08039488.2017.1410570", "date": "2017-12-07", "authors": [["Mo", "Weiming", "W", "a Department of Clinical Laboratory , Zhejiang Xiaoshan Hospital , Hangzhou , China."], ["Liu", "Jun", "J", "a Department of Clinical Laboratory , Zhejiang Xiaoshan Hospital , Hangzhou , China."], ["Zhang", "Zengyu", "Z", "b Department of Pediatrics , Xiaoshan First People's Hospital , Hangzhou , China."], ["Yu", "Hong", "H", "c Department of Child and Adolescent Mental Health , Zhejiang Xiaoshan Hospital , Hangzhou , China."], ["Yang", "Aiping", "A", "a Department of Clinical Laboratory , Zhejiang Xiaoshan Hospital , Hangzhou , China."], ["Qu", "Fei", "F", "a Department of Clinical Laboratory , Zhejiang Xiaoshan Hospital , Hangzhou , China."], ["Hu", "Pingfang", "P", "a Department of Clinical Laboratory , Zhejiang Xiaoshan Hospital , Hangzhou , China."], ["Liu", "Zhuo", "Z", "d Department of Internal Medicine , Zhejiang Xiaoshan Hospital , Hangzhou , China."], ["Hu", "Fengpei", "F", "e Institute of Brain and Management Science , Zhejiang University of Technology , Hangzhou , China."]]}
