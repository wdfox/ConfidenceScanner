{"title": "From Social Media to Mainstream News: The Information Flow of the Vaccine-Autism Controversy in the US, Canada, and the UK.", "text": "Despite increasing warnings about inaccurate information online, little is known about how social media contribute to the widespread diffusion of unverified health information.

Additionally, the results show that both Twitter and Reddit are more likely to discuss the vaccine-autism link compared to online news content.", "journal": ["Health communication", "Health Commun"], "id": "29028371", "doi": "10.1080/10410236.2017.1384433", "date": "2017-10-13", "authors": [["Jang", "S Mo", "SM", "a School of Journalism and Mass Communications , University of South Carolina."], ["Mckeever", "Brooke W", "BW", "a School of Journalism and Mass Communications , University of South Carolina."], ["Mckeever", "Robert", "R", "a School of Journalism and Mass Communications , University of South Carolina."], ["Kim", "Joon Kyoung", "JK", "a School of Journalism and Mass Communications , University of South Carolina."]]}
