{"title": "Symbolic Play in School-Aged Minimally Verbal Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.", "text": "Few interventions exist for school-aged minimally verbal children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Even though play skills are associated with children's production of language, few studies have focused on play for minimally verbal children. Fifty-eight minimally verbal children with ASD received a naturalistic developmental behavioral intervention. Children were randomized to receive a speech generating device in the context of the intervention or not. Children in both conditions improved in play skills at exit. Children demonstrated an increase in play skills in proximal (sessions) and distal (during blind assessment) contexts. Minimally verbal children with ASD can improve their play skills within a targeted intervention. Increases in symbolic play were associated with increases in expressive language skills.", "journal": ["Journal of autism and developmental disorders", "J Autism Dev Disord"], "id": "29170936", "doi": "10.1007/s10803-017-3388-6", "date": "2017-11-23", "authors": [["Chang", "Ya-Chih", "YC", "California State University, Los Angeles, 5151 State University Drive, Los Angeles, CA, 90032, USA. ychang27@calstatela.edu."], ["Shih", "Wendy", "W", "University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA."], ["Landa", "Rebecca", "R", "Kennedy Krieger Institute, Baltimore, MD, USA."], ["Kaiser", "Ann", "A", "Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA."], ["Kasari", "Connie", "C", "University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA."]]}
