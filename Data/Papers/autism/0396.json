{"title": "Enhancing the Validity of a Quality of Life Measure for Autistic People.", "text": "Accurate measurement of quality of life (QoL) is important for evaluation of autism services and trials of interventions. We undertook psychometric validation of the World Health Organisation measure-WHOQoL-BREF, examined construct validity of the WHO Disabilities module and developed nine additional autism-specific items (ASQoL) from extensive consultation with the autism community. The sample of 309 autistic people was recruited from the Adult Autism Spectrum Cohort-UK. The WHOQoL-BREF had good psychometric properties, including criterion, convergent, divergent and discriminant validity. The WHO Disabilities module showed adequate construct validity and reliability. The ASQoL items form a unitary factor of QoL, with one global item. Future studies can use the WHO measures alongside the ASQoL items to measure QoL of autistic people.", "journal": ["Journal of autism and developmental disorders", "J Autism Dev Disord"], "id": "29188584", "doi": "10.1007/s10803-017-3402-z", "date": "2017-11-29", "authors": [["McConachie", "Helen", "H", "Institute of Health and Society, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK. helen.mcconachie@ncl.ac.uk."], ["Mason", "David", "D", "Institute of Health and Society, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK."], ["Parr", "Jeremy R", "JR", "Institute of Neuroscience, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK."], ["Garland", "Deborah", "D", "National Autistic Society Resource Centre, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK."], ["Wilson", "Colin", "C", "Autism Advocate, Sunderland, UK."], ["Rodgers", "Jacqui", "J", "Institute of Neuroscience, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK."]]}
