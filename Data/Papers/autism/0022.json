Here we investigate the behavior of Scn1afl/+/PV-Cre-TG mice using a comprehensive battery of behavioral tests. We observed that Scn1afl/+/PV-Cre-TG mice display hyperactive behavior, impaired social novelty recognition, and altered spatial memory. We also generated Scn1afl/+/SST-Cre-KI mice with a selective Scn1a deletion in somatostatin-expressing (SST+) inhibitory neurons using an SST-IRES-Cre knock-in driver line. We observed that Scn1afl/+/SST-Cre-KI mice display no spontaneous convulsive seizures and that Scn1afl/+/SST-Cre-KI mice have a lowered threshold temperature for hyperthermia-induced seizures, although their threshold values are much higher than those of Scn1afl/+/PV-Cre-TG mice. We finally show that Scn1afl/+/SST-Cre-KI mice exhibited no noticeable behavioral abnormalities.
