{"title": "What Works for College Students with Autism Spectrum Disorder.", "text": "This article reports the results of a systematic review of the emerging research on programs and services designed to meet the needs of students with ASD. For the purposes of this review, only articles that included data on program outcomes were included. A total of eight studies that met this criterion were identified. These studies included three that examined the effects of cognitive-behavioral interventions, three that reported the results of methods to enhance social communication skills, one study of a transition to college program, and one evaluation of a variety of widely used accommodations. This review identifies methods that have been found to be effective supporting students with ASD in higher education settings as well as needs for future research.", "journal": ["Journal of autism and developmental disorders", "J Autism Dev Disord"], "id": "29249012", "doi": "10.1007/s10803-017-3434-4", "date": "2017-12-16", "authors": [["Kuder", "S Jay", "SJ", "Department of Interdisciplinary and Inclusive Education, Rowan University, 201 Mullica Hill Rd., Glassboro, NJ, 08028, USA. kuder@rowan.edu."], ["Accardo", "Amy", "A", "Department of Interdisciplinary and Inclusive Education, Rowan University, 201 Mullica Hill Rd., Glassboro, NJ, 08028, USA."]]}
