{"title": "Brief Report: Improving Social Outcomes for Students with Autism at Recess Through Peer-Mediated Pivotal Response Training.", "text": "Many students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) struggle to appropriately interact and play with their peers at recess. In this pilot feasibility study, we tested the efficacy of practitioner-implemented, peer-mediated Pivotal Response Training (PRT) with 11 elementary and middle school students with ASD. Participants were randomly assigned to a treatment or control group. We measured outcomes at multiple time points, and analyzed data using multi-level modeling with time nested within student. We demonstrated large and statistically significant increases in peer interaction (d\u2009=\u20091.13). Appropriate play with peers also increased substantially (d\u2009=\u20090.89). Practitioners and students provided positive feedback. These findings suggest school staff can feasibly facilitate peer-implemented PRT that improves social outcomes for students with ASD at recess.", "journal": ["Journal of autism and developmental disorders", "J Autism Dev Disord"], "id": "29255960", "doi": "10.1007/s10803-017-3435-3", "date": "2017-12-18", "authors": [["Brock", "Matthew E", "ME", "Crane Center for Early Childhood Education and Policy, Ohio State University, 334 PAES Building, 305 West 17th Avenue, Columbus, OH, 43210, USA. brock.184@osu.edu."], ["Dueker", "Scott A", "SA", "Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA."], ["Barczak", "Mary A", "MA", "Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA."]]}
