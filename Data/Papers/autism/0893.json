{"title": "Brief Report: Body Image in Autism: Evidence from Body Size Estimation.", "text": "Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have difficulties with social interaction and communication. First-hand accounts written by individuals with ASD have shown the existence of other atypical characteristics such as difficulties with body awareness. However, few studies have examined whether such atypicalities are found more generally among individuals with ASD. We examined body image (i.e., self-body awareness) by asking individuals with ASD and typically developing (TD) individuals to estimate their own body size (shoulder width). Results show that TD individuals estimated their shoulder width more accurately than individuals with ASD. This study suggests that individuals with ASD often experience misperceptions in their body size.", "journal": ["Journal of autism and developmental disorders", "J Autism Dev Disord"], "id": "29038931", "doi": "10.1007/s10803-017-3323-x", "date": "2017-10-16", "authors": [["Asada", "Kosuke", "K", "Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Komaba, Meguro-ku, Tokyo, 153-8904, Japan. asada@fc.hakuoh.ac.jp."], ["Tojo", "Yoshikuni", "Y", "College of Education, Ibaraki University, 2-1-1, Bunkyo, Mito, Ibaraki, 310-8512, Japan."], ["Hakarino", "Koichiro", "K", "Musashino Higashi Center for Education and Research, Musashino Higashi Gakuen, 2-1-10 Midoricho, Musashino, Tokyo, 180-0012, Japan."], ["Saito", "Atsuko", "A", "Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 3-8-1 Komaba, Meguro-ku, Tokyo, 153-8902, Japan."], ["Hasegawa", "Toshikazu", "T", "Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 3-8-1 Komaba, Meguro-ku, Tokyo, 153-8902, Japan."], ["Kumagaya", "Shinichiro", "S", "Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Komaba, Meguro-ku, Tokyo, 153-8904, Japan."]]}
