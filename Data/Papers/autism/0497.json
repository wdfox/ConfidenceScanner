{"title": "Brief Report: Mapping Systems of Support and Psychological Well-Being of Mothers of Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorders.", "text": "Parents of children with autism spectrum disorders are generally known to experience elevated levels of stress and poorer psychological well-being. To provide treatments and resources that most effectively support parent mental health, it is critical to understand how parents' connections with various networks and systems impact their well-being. This study examined the relationship between the psychological well-being of mothers of adolescents with ASD (n\u2009=\u200920) and their systems of support from an ecological systems theoretical framework. Findings indicated that most connections across mothers' ecosystems were strong in nature. However, the presence of strong connections was not significantly related to psychological well-being. In contrast, stressful/weak connections were significantly related to elevated levels of depressive symptoms, perceived stress, and sense of burden.", "journal": ["Journal of autism and developmental disorders", "J Autism Dev Disord"], "id": "29164438", "doi": "10.1007/s10803-017-3381-0", "date": "2017-11-21", "authors": [["Kuhn", "Jocelyn", "J", "University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, USA."], ["Ford", "Katie", "K", "University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, USA."], ["Dawalt", "Leann Smith", "LS", "University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, USA."]]}
