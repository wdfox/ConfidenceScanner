To support clinicians, researchers, and public health decision makers, we developed an information system dedicated to ASD, called TEDIS.

TEDIS will be deployed in nine ASD expert assessment centers in Ile-DeFrance district. We present security policy and infrastructure developed in context of TEDIS to protect patient privacy and clinical information. TEDIS security policy was organized around governance, ethical and organisational chart-agreement, patients consents, controlled user access, patients' privacy protection, constrained patients' data access.
