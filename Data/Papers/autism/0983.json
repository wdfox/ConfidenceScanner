{"title": "An Evaluation of Lag Schedules of Reinforcement During Functional Communication Training: Effects on Varied Mand Responding and Challenging Behavior.", "text": "We evaluated the effects of lag schedules of reinforcement during functional communication training (FCT) on the varied use of mands and challenging behavior by two individuals diagnosed with autism. Specifically, we compared the effects of Lag 0 and Lag 1 schedules of reinforcement during FCT. The results showed that each participant exhibited increases in varied mand responding during FCT with the Lag 1 schedule of reinforcement relative to Lag 0; challenging behavior remained low during both FCT lag conditions relative to baseline. Results are discussed in terms of treatment implications relating to FCT and the potential prevention and/or mitigation of clinical relapse during challenges to treatment.", "journal": ["Behavior analysis in practice", "Behav Anal Pract"], "id": "29021932", "doi": "10.1007/s40617-017-0179-7", "date": "2017-02-11", "authors": [["Adami", "Summer", "S", "Department of Special Education, The University of Texas at Austin, 1 University Station/D5300, Austin, TX 78712 USA."], ["Falcomata", "Terry S", "TS", "Department of Special Education, The University of Texas at Austin, 1 University Station/D5300, Austin, TX 78712 USA."], ["Muething", "Colin S", "CS", "Department of Special Education, The University of Texas at Austin, 1 University Station/D5300, Austin, TX 78712 USA."], ["Hoffman", "Katherine", "K", "Department of Special Education, The University of Texas at Austin, 1 University Station/D5300, Austin, TX 78712 USA."]]}
