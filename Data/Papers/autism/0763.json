{"title": "Time-Lag Between Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder and Onset of Publicly-Funded Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention: Do Race-Ethnicity and Neighborhood Matter?", "text": "Health coverage of early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI) for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is rapidly expanding across the United States. Yet we know little about the time-lag between diagnosis and treatment onset. We integrated administrative, Medicaid claims, and Census data for children in an EIBI Medicaid waiver (n\u2009=\u2009473) to examine the relationship between time-lag and (a) child race-ethnicity and (b) neighborhood racial composition, poverty, affluence, and urbanicity. We explored whether the relationship between child race-ethnicity and time-lag varies by neighborhood characteristics. Average time-lag between diagnosis and treatment onset was nearly 3 years. Child race-ethnicity and neighborhood characteristics did not predict time-lag. Reducing time-lag is critical to ensuring that children with ASD receive treatment as early as possible.", "journal": ["Journal of autism and developmental disorders", "J Autism Dev Disord"], "id": "29080927", "doi": "10.1007/s10803-017-3354-3", "date": "2017-10-28", "authors": [["Yingling", "Marissa E", "ME", "Kent School of Social Work, University of Louisville, 2217 S 3rd St., Julius John Oppenheimer Hall, Louisville, USA. marissa.yingling@louisville.edu."], ["Hock", "Robert M", "RM", "College of Social Work, Hamilton College, University of South Carolina, 1512 Pendleton Street, Columbia, USA."], ["Bell", "Bethany A", "BA", "College of Social Work, Hamilton College, University of South Carolina, 1512 Pendleton Street, Columbia, USA."]]}
