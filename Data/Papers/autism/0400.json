However, no studies to date have examined the genetics of individuals dually diagnosed with both ASD and psychosis. In this study, we present findings of copy number variants (CNVs) from a study of 116 well-characterised individuals with this dual diagnosis. DNA was extracted and arrayed using the Affymetrix CytoScan HD 2.8M array or the Affymetrix Cytogenetics arrays and compared with existing samples from the Database of Genomic Variants and the Simons Simplex Collection of CNVs from individuals with ASD and their families. Twenty-seven novel CNVs \u226520k base pairs were identified in the sample, most occurring in only a single individual, although two were found in two female participants. Forty-nine rare CNVs (<1.5% rate in general population) were also found at significantly higher frequencies than expected. The findings may provide evidence for areas of further study in the understanding of the development of both ASD and psychosis due to the number of affected genetic regions that have not previously been linked to these conditions.", "doi": "10.1016/j.ejmg.2017.12.005", "journal": ["European journal of medical genetics", "Eur J Med Genet"], "date": "2018-01-18_23:46:08"}
