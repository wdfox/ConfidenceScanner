{"title": "Teaching reading comprehension to learners with autism spectrum disorder: Discrepancies between teacher and research-recommended practices.", "text": "Students with autism spectrum disorder have been found to experience difficulty with reading comprehension despite intact decoding and word recognition. This identified need for targeted reading comprehension remediation results in a need for teachers to utilize research-based practices and to individualize instruction for students with autism spectrum disorder; however, teachers report a lack of access to such practices. This study utilized survey methodology to gather perceptions and experiences of teachers and to compare teacher preparedness to use effective instructional practices emerging from the extant research to teacher-reported effective practices in the classroom. Study findings, based on 112 participants, reveal a discrepancy between teacher-reported effective practices, and the practices identified as effective through research, indicating a research to practice gap. Implications for practice include professional development recommendations, and the need for increased communication between researchers and teachers.", "journal": ["Autism : the international journal of research and practice", "Autism"], "id": "29160095", "doi": "10.1177/1362361317730744", "date": "2017-11-01", "authors": [["Accardo", "Amy L", "AL", "1 Rowan University, USA."], ["Finnegan", "Elizabeth G", "EG", "2 St. Thomas Aquinas College, USA."]]}
