Clinical charts were reviewed. Results were analysed using mixed methodology.Ninety-seven % (73/76) of surveys were completed. Pediatricians reported that 36% of parents had difficulties understanding genetic testing and that 40% seemed anxious. The majority expected testing to have positive impacts on children/families. The themes raised were 1) clarifying the diagnosis (56%), 2) understanding the aetiology of the condition (55%), 3) enabling prenatal diagnosis/counselling (43%), 4) improving medical care for the child (15%) and 5) decreasing parental guilt/anxiety (8%). Less than half anticipated negative impacts; 74% expected that the most helpful result for their patient would be an abnormal result explaining the disorder. Among the 73 children for whom CMA was ordered, 81% got tested: 66% of the results were normal, 19% were abnormal and contributed to explain the condition and 12% were abnormal but of unknown significance.Paediatricians generally expect many positive and less negative impacts of genetic testing for children with developmental disorders.
