{"title": "Disparities in Life Course Outcomes for Transition-Aged Youth with Disabilities.", "text": "Close to 750,000 youth with special health care needs transition to adult health care in the United States every year; however, less than one-half receive transition-planning services. Using the \"F-words\" organizing framework, this article explores life course outcomes and disparities in transition-aged youth with disabilities, with a special focus on youth with autism, Down syndrome, and cerebral palsy. Despite the importance of transition, a review of the available literature revealed that (1) youth with disabilities continue to have poor outcomes in all six \"F-words\" domains (ie, function, family, fitness, fun, friends, and future) and (2) transition outcomes vary by race/ethnicity and disability. Professionals need to adopt a holistic framework to examine transition outcomes within a broader social-ecological context, as well as implement evidence-based transition practices to help improve postsecondary outcomes of youth with disabilities.
