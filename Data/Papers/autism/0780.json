{"title": "Caregiver Burden Varies by Sensory Subtypes and Sensory Dimension Scores of Children with Autism.", "text": "Understanding characteristics associated with burden in caregivers of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is critical due to negative health consequences. We explored the association between child sensory subtype, sensory dimension scores, and caregiver burden. A national survey of caregivers of children with ASD aged 5-13\u00a0years was conducted (n\u2009=\u2009367). The relationship between variables of interest and indicators of caregiver burden, including health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and caregiver strain, was examined with canonical correlation analyses. Caregiver strain was, but caregiver HRQOL was not, significantly associated with child sensory subtype and sensory dimension scores. Caregiver age, child age, and household income were also associated with caregiver strain. Potential explanatory mechanisms for these findings, derived from published qualitative studies, are discussed.", "journal": ["Journal of autism and developmental disorders", "J Autism Dev Disord"], "id": "29076036", "doi": "10.1007/s10803-017-3348-1", "date": "2017-10-26", "authors": [["Hand", "Brittany N", "BN", "College of Health Professions, Medical University of South Carolina, 151B Rutledge Ave., Charleston, SC, 29403, USA. handbr@musc.edu."], ["Lane", "Alison E", "AE", "Priority Research Centre Grow Up Well\u00ae, The University of Newcastle, Newcastle, NSW, Australia."], ["De Boeck", "Paul", "P", "Department of Psychology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA."], ["Basso", "D Michele", "DM", "School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA."], ["Nichols-Larsen", "Deborah S", "DS", "School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA."], ["Darragh", "Amy R", "AR", "School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA."]]}
