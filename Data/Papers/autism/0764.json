{"title": "Metaperception in Adolescents With and Without Autism Spectrum Disorder.", "text": "This study compared how adolescents with and without autism spectrum disorder (ASD) evaluated unfamiliar peers (i.e., perceptions), as well as how adolescents believed they were evaluated by peers (i.e., metaperceptions). The Perceptions and Metaperceptions Questionnaire was designed to quantify perceptions and metaperceptions following a live interaction. For all adolescents, more positive perceptions of the peer were associated with more positive metaperceptions. Adolescents with ASD exhibited more accurate metaperceptions than did typically developing adolescents. More positive perceptions and metaperceptions were associated with higher levels of observed social competence across groups. Findings extend our understanding of typically and atypically developing adolescents' impressions of unfamiliar peers and their ability to discern what peers think of them.", "journal": ["Journal of autism and developmental disorders", "J Autism Dev Disord"], "id": "29080926", "doi": "10.1007/s10803-017-3356-1", "date": "2017-10-28", "authors": [["Usher", "Lauren V", "LV", "University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL, USA. usher3@wisc.edu."], ["Burrows", "Catherine A", "CA", "University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL, USA."], ["Messinger", "Daniel S", "DS", "University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL, USA."], ["Henderson", "Heather A", "HA", "University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada."]]}
