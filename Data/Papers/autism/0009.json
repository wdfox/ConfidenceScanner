Genetic cause was subgrouped into deletion and other genetic aberrations of the 15q11-q13 area. The number of signs used to communicate (<\u200920 sign and \u2265\u200920 signs) was used as a measure of nonverbal communication.Mean age of epilepsy onset was 3.0\u00a0years (range 3\u00a0months-7.8\u00a0years).
