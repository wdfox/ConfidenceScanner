{"title": "Motor, Somatosensory, Viscerosensory and Metabolic Impairments in a Heterozygous Female Rat Model of Rett Syndrome.", "text": "Rett Syndrome (RTT), an autism-related disorder caused by mutation of the X-linked Methyl CpG-binding Protein 2 (MECP2) gene, is characterized by severe cognitive and intellectual deficits. While cognitive deficits are well-documented in humans and rodent models, impairments of sensory, motor and metabolic functions also occur but remain poorly understood. To better understand non-cognitive deficits in RTT, we studied female rats heterozygous for Mecp2 mutation (Mecp2-/x); unlike commonly used male Mecp2-/y rodent models, this more closely approximates human RTT where males rarely survive. Mecp2-/x rats showed rapid, progressive decline of motor coordination through six months of age as assessed by rotarod performance, accompanied by deficits in gait and posture. Mecp2-/x rats were hyper-responsive to noxious pressure and cold, but showed visceral hyposensitivity when tested by colorectal distension. Mecp2-/x rats ate less, drank more, and had more body fat resulting in increased weight gain. Our findings reveal an array of progressive non-cognitive deficits in this rat model that are likely to contribute to the compromised quality of life that characterizes RTT.", "journal": ["International journal of molecular sciences", "Int J Mol Sci"], "id": "29286317", "doi": "10.3390/ijms19010097", "date": "2017-12-29", "authors": [["Bhattacherjee", "Aritra", "A", "Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS 66160, USA.
