{"title": "Anxiety in Williams Syndrome: The Role of Social Behaviour, Executive Functions and Change Over Time.", "text": "Anxiety is a prevalent mental health issue for individuals with Williams syndrome (WS). Relatively little is known about the developmental course of anxiety, or how it links with core features of WS, namely social and executive functioning (EF). In this study, parent-reports of anxiety were compared across a 4-year period (N\u2009=\u200917), and links between anxiety, social and EF were explored from concurrent parent-reports (N\u2009=\u200926). Results indicated that high anxiety persisted over time, and anxiety was related to impairments in both social and executive functioning. Importantly, results indicated that impairments in EFs may drive the links between anxiety and social functioning. This timely investigation provides new insights into anxiety in WS and highlights potential areas for intervention.", "journal": ["Journal of autism and developmental disorders", "J Autism Dev Disord"], "id": "29124472", "doi": "10.1007/s10803-017-3357-0", "date": "2017-11-09", "authors": [["Ng-Cordell", "Elise", "E", "Department of Psychology, Durham University, Durham, UK."], ["Hanley", "Mary", "M", "Department of Psychology, Durham University, Durham, UK. mary.hanley@durham.ac.uk."], ["Kelly", "Alyssa", "A", "Department of Psychology, Durham University, Durham, UK."], ["Riby", "Deborah M", "DM", "Department of Psychology, Durham University, Durham, UK."]]}
