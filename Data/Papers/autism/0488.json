{"title": "Specific Patterns of Emotion Recognition from Faces in Children with ASD: Results of a Cross-Modal Matching Paradigm.", "text": "Children with ASD show emotion recognition difficulties, as part of their social communication deficits. We examined facial emotion recognition (FER) in intellectually disabled children with ASD and in younger typically developing (TD) controls, matched on mental age. Our emotion-matching paradigm employed three different modalities: facial, vocal and verbal. Results confirmed overall FER deficits in ASD. Compared to the TD group, children with ASD had the poorest performance in recognizing surprise and anger in comparison to happiness and sadness, and struggled with face-face matching, compared to voice-face and word-face combinations. Performance in the voice-face cross-modal recognition task was related to adaptive communication. These findings highlight the specific face processing deficit, and the relative merit of cross-modal integration in children with ASD.", "journal": ["Journal of autism and developmental disorders", "J Autism Dev Disord"], "id": "29164447", "doi": "10.1007/s10803-017-3389-5", "date": "2017-11-21", "authors": [["Golan", "Ofer", "O", "Department of Psychology, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel. ofer.golan@biu.ac.il."], ["Gordon", "Ilanit", "I", "Department of Psychology, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel."], ["Fichman", "Keren", "K", "School of Psychological Sciences, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel."], ["Keinan", "Giora", "G", "School of Psychological Sciences, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel."]]}
