{"title": "A Survey-Based Method to Evaluate Optimal Treatment Selection for Escape-Maintained Problem Behavior.", "text": "Geiger, Carr, and LeBlanc (2010) developed a decision-making model for escape-maintained problem behavior that could be used to guide the course of treatment selection. We used a digital survey to evaluate the model's potential usefulness. We presented novice and expert practitioners' written hypothetical scenarios and asked them to determine the optimal treatment in a given situation. Some participants were given the model, whereas others were instructed to use their best clinical judgment. Using logistic regression analyses, the general findings for our scenarios were the following: (a) experts without the aid of a decision model had better odds of selecting the optimal treatment than novices without the decision model, (b) experts with the decision model did not have greater odds of selecting optimal treatment than experts without the model, and", "journal": ["Behavior analysis in practice", "Behav Anal Pract"], "id": "29021933", "doi": "10.1007/s40617-017-0180-1", "date": "2017-04-07", "authors": [["Saini", "Valdeep", "V", "Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY USA."], ["Betz", "Alison M", "AM", "Coastal Behavior Analysis' Center for Autism Research and Education, Vero Beach, FL USA."], ["Gregory", "Meagan K", "MK", "Kennedy Krieger Institute, Baltimore, MD USA."], ["Leon", "Yanerys", "Y", "Florida Institute of Technology, Miami, USA."], ["Fernandez", "Nathalie", "N", "University of Florida, Gainesville, FL USA."]]}
