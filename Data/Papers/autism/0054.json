{"title": "Increasing appropriate conversation skills using a behavioral skills training package for adults with intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder.", "text": "The current research evaluates the effectiveness of a behavioral skills training (BST) package used to increase appropriate conversation interactions for six adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Deficits in the area of social skills can become a significant feature for individuals with disabilities and in particular for those with ASD. A multiple probe design across participant dyads was employed to examine the effects of the intervention on conversation interactions. The BST package was delivered in small group instruction and included (i) instructions about having a conversation, (ii) modeling a conversation, (iii) practicing a conversation, and (iv) feedback on performance during each session. Results indicated that BST was effective for increasing appropriate conversation interactions for all six participants, and maintenance was evident 4 weeks post intervention. The findings were discussed in relation to the importance of social interactions and communication amongst this population.", "journal": ["Journal of intellectual disabilities : JOID", "J Intellect Disabil"], "id": "29291670", "doi": "10.1177/1744629517750744", "date": "2017-01-01", "authors": [["Ryan", "Grace", "G", "National University of Ireland, Ireland."], ["Brady", "Shelley", "S", "RehabCare, Ireland."], ["Holloway", "Jennifer", "J", "National University of Ireland, Ireland."], ["Lydon", "Helena", "H", "National University of Ireland, Ireland."]]}
