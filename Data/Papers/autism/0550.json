{"title": "Double Voicing and Personhood in Collaborative Life Writing about Autism: the Transformative Narrative of Carly's Voice.", "text": "Collaborative memoirs by co-writers with and without autism can enable the productive interaction of the voices of the writers in ways that can empower rather than exploit the disabled subject. Carly's Voice, co-written by Arthur Fleischmann and his autistic daughter Carly, demonstrates the capacity for such life narratives to facilitate the relational interaction between writers in the negotiation of understandings of disability. Though the text begins by focusing on the limitations of life with autism, it develops into a collaboration which helps both writers move toward new ways of understanding disability and their own and one another's life stories.", "journal": ["The Journal of medical humanities", "J Med Humanit"], "id": "29152670", "doi": "10.1007/s10912-017-9496-7", "date": "2017-11-20", "authors": [["Orlando", "Monica", "M", "Shawnee State University, 940 Second St., Portsmouth, OH, 45662, USA. morlando@shawnee.edu."]]}
