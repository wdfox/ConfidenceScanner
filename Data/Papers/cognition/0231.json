In 3\u00d7Tg-AD mice, AF710B attenuates cognitive deficits and decreases Alzheimer-like hallmarks. We now report on the long-lasting disease-modifying properties of AF710B in McGill-R-Thy1-APP transgenic (Tg) rats.Chronic treatment with AF710B (10\u00a0\u03bcg/kg) was initiated in postplaque 13-month-old Tg rats. Drug or vehicle was administered orally daily for 4.5\u00a0months and interrupted 5\u00a0weeks before behavioral testing.AF710B long-term treatment reverted the cognitive deficits associated with advanced Alzheimer-like amyloid neuropathology in Tg rats. These effects were accompanied by reductions in amyloid pathology and markers of neuroinflammation and increases in amyloid cerebrospinal fluid clearance and levels of a synaptic marker. Importantly, these effects were maintained following a 5-week interruption of the treatment.With M1/sigma-1 activity and long-lasting disease-modifying properties at low dose, AF710B is a promising novel therapeutic agent for treating Alzheimer's disease.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jalz.2017.11.009", "title": "AF710B, an M1/sigma-1 receptor agonist with long-lasting disease-modifying properties in a transgenic rat model of Alzheimer's disease.", "journal": ["Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association", "Alzheimers Dement"]}
