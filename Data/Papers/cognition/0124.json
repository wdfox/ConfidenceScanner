Effectiveness was evaluated by annualised relapse rate, Expanded Disability Status Scale progression, cranial magnetic resonance imaging and cognitive testing. Fatigue was assessed by the Fatigue Severity Scale.Sixty-eight patients were screened and 67 enrolled, with mean (standard deviation) age 14.2 (1.3) years (n=65 in the effectiveness analysis). Mean disease duration was 11 months before study enrolment; at baseline, mean (standard deviation) Expanded Disability Status Scale was 0.6 (1.0); T2 lesion number 18.3 (15.1). Mean annualised relapse rate during the study was 0.7 (n=57), 28/57 patients (49.1%) had no relapses and for 40/52 (76.9%) no Expanded Disability Status Scale progression was observed; 23/56 (41.1%) were relapse- and progression-free to last follow-up. Neuropsychological test and fatigue scores were within normal ranges (baseline and last follow-up). Eighteen patients had fatigue at some point. New T2 and gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) lesions were seen in 43/55 (66.2%) and 29/55 (52.7%) patients respectively. Most frequent adverse events were influenza-like illness, headache, injection-site reactions and elevated liver enzymes.Interferon beta-1b is an effective treatment with a favourable safety profile for paediatric patients.", "doi": "10.1177/2055217317747623", "title": "Interferon beta-1b in treatment-na\u00efve paediatric patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis: Two-year results from the BETAPAEDIC study.", "journal": ["Multiple sclerosis journal - experimental, translational and clinical", "Mult Scler J Exp Transl Clin"]}
