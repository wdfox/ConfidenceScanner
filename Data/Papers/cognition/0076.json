In this context, we have elaborated on the role of specific continuous magnitudes. We have also found it important to devote a section to evidence considered the \"smoking gun\" of the approximate number system theory, including cross-modal studies, animal studies, and so forth. Lastly, we suggested some ways in which the scientific community can promote more transparent and collaborative research by using an open science approach, sharing both raw data and stimuli. We thank the contributors for their enlightening comments and look forward to future developments in the field.", "doi": "10.1017/S0140525X17000619", "title": "Toward an integrative approach to numerical cognition.", "journal": ["The Behavioral and brain sciences", "Behav Brain Sci"]}
