Yet what is meant by \"understanding\"? As soon as we try to operationalize this concept, I argue that understanding amounts to building models of a set of related empirical phenomena. In this commentary, I discuss three such criteria, namely, predictability, simplicity, and computability, that I find useful in guiding the quest for better models and what they imply for the use of deep nets in brain research.", "doi": "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.12.006", "title": "Predict, then simplify.", "journal": ["NeuroImage", "Neuroimage"]}
