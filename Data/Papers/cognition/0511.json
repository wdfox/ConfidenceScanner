Self-perceived cognitive function was longitudinally assessed using the validated FACT-Cog (ver. 3) across three time points: Prior to chemotherapy (T1), during chemotherapy (T2), and at the end of chemotherapy (T3). Plasma BDNF levels were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Genotyping was performed using Sanger Sequencing.A total of 51 chemotherapy-receiving ESBC patients (mean age: 52.6\u2009\u00b1\u20099.5\u00a0years) were recruited, and 11 patients (21.6%) reported subjective cognitive impairment post-chemotherapy. Overall, there was a reduction in median plasma BDNF levels over time (T1: 5423.0\u00a0pg/ml; T2: 5313.6\u00a0pg/ml; T3: 4050.3\u00a0pg/ml; p\u2009<\u20090.01). After adjusting for confounding factors, longitudinal analysis revealed that BDNF levels were associated with self-reported concentration deficit (p\u2009=\u20090.032). Carriers of Val/Val (p\u2009=\u20090.011) and Val/Met (p\u2009=\u20090.003) BDNF genotypes demonstrated a significant reduction in plasma BDNF levels over time; however, plasma BDNF levels were similar across all time points among Met homozygous carriers (p\u2009=\u20090.107).There was a statistically significant change in BDNF levels post-chemotherapy in ESBC patients, and plasma BDNF levels were associated with self-perceived concentration deficit in patients receiving chemotherapy.", "doi": "10.1186/s12885-017-3861-9", "title": "Evaluation of plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels and self-perceived cognitive impairment post-chemotherapy: a longitudinal study.", "journal": ["BMC cancer", "BMC Cancer"]}
