To assess whether rivastigmine therapy is associated with decreased brain inflammation and damage, we performed T1/T2* relaxometry and magnetization transfer imaging in 17 aviremic HIV+ patients with minor neurocognitive disorders enrolled on a crossed over randomized rivastigmine trial. Rivastigmine therapy was associated with changes in MRI metrics indicating a decrease in brain water content (i.e., edema reabsorption) and/or reduced demyelination/axonal damage. Furthermore, MRI changes correlated with cognitive improvement on rivastigmine therapy.", "doi": "10.1002/acn3.493", "title": "Rivastigmine decreases brain damage in HIV patients with mild cognitive deficits.", "journal": ["Annals of clinical and translational neurology", "Ann Clin Transl Neurol"]}
