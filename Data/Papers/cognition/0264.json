Radiation therapy on the brain has side effects, which can impact on the cognitive functioning. The cognitive disorders constitute a predictive factor of the quality of life of the patients impacting on their autonomy, as well as on their social and professional life. This problem thus takes a more and more important place in the reflection on the cancer care. A better detection of these cognitive disorders requires a better cognitive evaluation from the diagnosis. What would allow the implementation of preventive actions upstream. This prospect of improvement of the coverage of the cognitive consequences of the irradiation should allow a better social reinstatement after the treatment, as well as a facilitation for the preservation of autonomy and functional independence. However, a complete cognitive evaluation is expensive in time and asks for a qualified personnel, which often slows down the exploration and the follow-up of the disorders.", "doi": "10.1016/j.bulcan.2017.11.003", "title": "[Neurocognition: Impact of radiotherapy].", "journal": ["Bulletin du cancer", "Bull Cancer"]}
