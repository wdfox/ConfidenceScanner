This pilot study was designed to explore the potential benefits of a program of stimulation of executive functions (SEF) on the functional aspects of language and communication through the assessment of the functional communicative profile and social-cognitive performance.Twenty children, aged 5-12 years, with a diagnosis of ASD participated in the study. Two stimulation programs were offered over a 10- to 12-week period as part of the regular services offered to these children through a University's speech and language therapy outpatient clinic in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. Children either received SEF intervention in their home implemented by their parent/s, with close monitoring by the speech-language pathologist (SLP) (group 1), or they received SEF by the SLP during regular speech-language therapy individual sessions (group 2).The findings suggested that there were differences between the children's pre- and posttest performance. Significantly different performances were observed in the areas of occupation of communication space, proportion of communicative interactivity, and social-cognitive performance.The inclusion of activities to stimulate executive function abilities in language intervention for children with ASD warrants further investigation.", "doi": "10.1159/000479586", "title": "Stimulation of Executive Functions as Part of the Language Intervention Process in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.", "journal": ["Folia phoniatrica et logopaedica : official organ of the International Association of Logopedics and Phoniatrics (IALP)", "Folia Phoniatr Logop"]}
