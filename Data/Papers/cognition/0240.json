Mothers in the third trimester of pregnancy with their second child were recruited to attend this quantitative study. Data were obtained by means of mother-report questionnaires. Mothers completed questionnaires assessing their attachment to their own mother, parenting efficacy in raising their first child, and antenatal attachment to their second baby. Hierarchical regression modeling was conducted. Mothers' attachment to their own mother was associated with antenatal attachment to their second baby, but this association was moderated by parenting efficacy in raising the first child. Specifically, mothers' attachment to their own mother was positively associated with antenatal attachment among mothers with high parenting efficacy. The results suggest that parenting efficacy may enhance the role of maternal attachment on emotional relationships between second-time mothers and their baby during the pregnancy. Second-time mothers who experienced low parenting efficacy in raising their first child should receive training in parenting. It may be beneficial to take parenting-related cognition into account when planning interventions.", "doi": "10.1007/s00737-017-0808-8", "title": "Mother's attachment history and antenatal attachment to the second baby: the moderating role of parenting efficacy in raising the firstborn child.", "journal": ["Archives of women's mental health", "Arch Womens Ment Health"]}
