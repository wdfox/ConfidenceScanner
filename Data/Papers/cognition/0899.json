The aim of this study is to demonstrate cerebral retention of A\u03b2 in cognitively normal older adults, by implementing voxel-based analysis on images acquired from 18F-Florbetaben amyloid PET.Fifty cognitive normal elderly subjects were recruited and included in the study. Demographic data and cognitive measurements were collected. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 18F-Florbetaben PET data were obtained followed by whole brain voxel-based analysis.Compared to the florbetaben (FBB) (-) counterpart, FBB (+) showed significantly higher A\u03b2 deposition in the brain regions comprising anterior cingulate, middle cingulate, posterior cingulate and precuneus (family wise error corrected p<0.05). There was no significant correlation between amyloid retention and cognitive functions.Our results confirms previous results regarding A\u03b2 deposition by using 18F-Florbetaben, demonstrating potentials in application of 18F-Florbetaben PET imaging in clinical settings.", "doi": "10.4306/pi.2017.14.6.883", "title": "Whole Brain Voxel-Wise Analysis of Cerebral Retention of Beta-Amyloid in Cognitively Normal Older Adults Using 18F-Florbetaben.", "journal": ["Psychiatry investigation", "Psychiatry Investig"]}
