The secondary objective was to explore the associations between depression severity, perceived cognitive dysfunction and functional disability.This was a multi-country, multi-centre, cross-sectional study. Adults with a current episode of MDD were recruited from 9 university/general hospital clinics in Asia. During a single study visit, psychiatrists assessed depression severity (Clinical Global Impression-Severity, CGI-S); patients completed questionnaires assessing depression severity (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 items, PHQ-9), perceived cognitive dysfunction (Perceived Deficit Questionnaire-Depression, PDQ-D) and functional disability (Sheehan Disability Scale, SDS).Patients (n=664), predominantly women (66.3%), were aged 46.5\u00b112.5 years, lived in urban areas (81.3%) and were employed (84.6%). 51.5% of patients were having their first depressive episode; 86.7% were receiving treatment; 82.2% had a current episode duration >8 weeks. Patients had mild-to-moderate depression (CGI-S=3.3\u00b11.0; PHQ-9=11.3\u00b16.9). Patients reported perceived cognitive dysfunction (PDQ-D=22.6\u00b116.2) and functional disability (SDS=11.3\u00b17.9). PHQ-9, PDQ-D and SDS were moderately-to-highly correlated (PHQ-9 and SDS: r=0.72; PHQ-9 and PDQ-D: r=0.69; PDQ-D and SDS, r=0.63). ANCOVA showed that after controlling for patient-reported depression severity (PHQ-9), perceived cognitive dysfunction (PDQ-D) was significantly associated with functional disability (SDS) (p<0.001).Asian patients with MDD reported perceived cognitive dysfunction. There is a need for physicians to evaluate cognitive dysfunction in the clinical setting in order to reach treatment goals, including functional recovery beyond remission of mood symptoms.", "doi": "10.2174/1745017901713010185", "title": "Cognitive Dysfunction in Asian Patients with Depression (CogDAD): A Cross-Sectional Study.", "journal": ["Clinical practice and epidemiology in mental health : CP & EMH", "Clin Pract Epidemiol Ment Health"]}
