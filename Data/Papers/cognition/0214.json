The present study was designed to compare the classification accuracy of a more liberal alternative (\u226415) to the de facto FCR cutoff (\u226414).The classification accuracy of the two cutoffs was computed in reference to psychometrically defined invalid performance, across various criterion measures, in a sample of 104 adults with TBI clinically referred for neuropsychological assessment.The FCR was highly predictive (AUC: .71-.83) of Pass/Fail status on reference PVTs, but unrelated to performance on measures known to be sensitive to TBI. On average, FCR \u226415 correctly identified an additional 6% of invalid response sets compared to FCR \u226414, while maintaining .92 specificity. Patients who failed the FCR reported higher levels of emotional distress.Results suggest that even a single error on the FCR is a reliable indicator of invalid responding. Further research is needed to investigate the clinical significance of the relationship between failing the FCR and level of self-reported psychiatric symptoms.", "doi": "10.1093/acn/acx110", "title": "A Single Error Is One Too Many: The Forced Choice Recognition Trial of the CVLT-II as a Measure of Performance Validity in Adults with TBI.", "journal": ["Archives of clinical neuropsychology : the official journal of the National Academy of Neuropsychologists", "Arch Clin Neuropsychol"]}
