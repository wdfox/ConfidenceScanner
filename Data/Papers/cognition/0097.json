In the present study, the memory loss induced by human Abeta protein over-expression in fruitfly Alzheimer's disease (AD) model was rescued by multiple extracts from Gardenia jasminoides. Three extracts that rich with gardenia yellow, geniposide, and gardenoside components showed distinct rescue effect on memory loss. Further investigation on adding gardenoside into a formula of Ganoderma lucidum, Panax notoginseng and Panax ginseng (GPP) also support its therapeutic effects on memory improvement. Interestingly, the application of GPP and gardenoside did not alter the accumulation of Abeta proteins but suppressed the expression of immune-related genes in the brain. These results revealed the importance and relevancy of anti-inflammation process and the underlying mechanisms on rescuing memory deficits, suggesting the potential therapeutic use of the improved GPP formulation in improving cognition in defined population in the future.", "doi": "10.1016/S1875-5364(18)30005-0", "title": "Effects of Gardenia jasminoides extracts on cognition and innate immune response in an adult Drosophila model of Alzheimer's disease.", "journal": ["Chinese journal of natural medicines", "Chin J Nat Med"]}
