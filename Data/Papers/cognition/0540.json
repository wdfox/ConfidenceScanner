The total effect was decomposed into direct and indirect effects (via late-life depressive symptoms), obtained from an accelerated failure time model with weights derived from multivariable logistic regression of late-life depressive symptoms on subclinical CVD. Analyses were adjusted by baseline covariates: age, race, sex, poverty status, marital status, body mass index, smoking status, ApoE4 status, and mCES-D.Participants contributed 20,994 person-years of follow-up with a median follow-up time of 9.4 years. Subclinical CVD was associated with 12% faster time to MCI/dementia (time ratio [TR]: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.83, 0.93). The total effect of subclinical CVD on MCI/dementia onset was decomposed into a direct effect (TR: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.92, 0.98) and indirect effect (TR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.88, 0.97); 64.5% of the total effect was mediated by late-life depressive symptoms.These data suggest late-life depressive symptoms partially mediate the association of subclinical CVD with MCI/dementia onset.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jagp.2017.11.004", "title": "Late-Life Depressive Symptoms as Partial Mediators in the Associations between Subclinical Cardiovascular Disease with Onset of Mild Cognitive Impairment and Dementia.", "journal": ["The American journal of geriatric psychiatry : official journal of the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry", "Am J Geriatr Psychiatry"]}
