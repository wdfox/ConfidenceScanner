Here we developed a mouse model harboring a frame-shift mutation in Dyrk1a resulting in a protein truncation and elimination of its kinase activity site. Dyrk1a+/- mice showed significant impairments in cognition and cognitive flexibility, communicative ultrasonic vocalizations, and social contacts. Susceptibility to hyperthermia-induced seizures was also significantly increased in these mice. The truncation leading to haploinsufficiency of DYRK1A in mice thus recapitulates the syndromic phenotypes observed in human patients and constitutes a useful model for further investigations of the mechanisms leading to ASD, speech delay and febrile seizures.", "doi": "10.1016/j.nbd.2017.12.003", "title": "DYRK1A-haploinsufficiency in mice causes autistic-like features and febrile seizures.", "journal": ["Neurobiology of disease", "Neurobiol.
