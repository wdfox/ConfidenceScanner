We thought the symptoms from the perspective of cognitive science. In the process of discovering the grounds by which delusions occur in patients, by the setting of goals which are not restricted by others, and by enhancing the presence such that new frame construction with integrity can be continuously possible, we report the case that delusion has disappeared and has been cured. When considering what client-centered medical care is, it is necessary to reconsider the mechanism of cognition of patients from the perspective of information fields which occur within relationships, and to support patients so that they can select what they want to do from the standpoint of the goals they seek.", "doi": "10.1002/jgf2.34", "title": "Cases which were treated by giving grounds to delusion: What is client-centered medical care?", "journal": ["Journal of general and family medicine", "J Gen Fam Med"]}
