QoL was assessed by Pediatric Quality of Life (PEDQOL) questionnaire and PEDQOL scores of parental and self-assessed QoL during 3 years follow-up after CP diagnosis were analyzed.Parents estimated QoL of their children worse than patients did themselves. GH substitution had no relevant effect on short-term weight and height development. CP patients GH-treated at 3 years follow-up presented at baseline (1 year after diagnosis, before GH substitution) with reduced self-assessed QoL when compared with GH non-treated CP. QoL stabilized during 1-3 years of follow-up in GH-treated patients, whereas non GH-treated patients experienced decreases in autonomy (p\u2009=\u20090.03), cognition (p\u2009=\u20090.01), and physical function (p\u2009=\u20090.04).Parents assess QoL in CP survivors worse than their children. GH substitution should be considered as a therapeutic option to ameliorate imminent impairments of QoL after CP.", "doi": "10.1007/s12020-017-1489-9", "title": "Quality of life and growth after childhood craniopharyngioma: results of the multinational trial\u00a0KRANIOPHARYNGEOM 2007.", "journal": ["Endocrine", "Endocrine"]}
