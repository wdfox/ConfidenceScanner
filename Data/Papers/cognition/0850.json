However, the exact neural basis of these signals remains unclear. To address this question, we determined the relationship between LFP signals and another, much better understood, signature of neural activity: action potentials. Specifically, we focused on the relationship between the amplitude of stimulus-induced LFPs and the magnitude of spiking activity in visual cortex of non-human primates. Our trial-by-trial correlation analyses between these two components of extracellular signals in macaque visual cortex show that the spike rate is coupled to the LFP amplitude with a surprisingly long latency, typically 50\u2009ms. Our analysis shows that the neural spike rate is a significant predictor of the LFP amplitude. This limits the functional interpretation of LFP signals beyond that based on spiking activities.", "doi": "10.1038/s41598-017-17372-4", "title": "Local field potentials are induced by visually evoked spiking activity in macaque cortical area MT.", "journal": ["Scientific reports", "Sci Rep"]}
