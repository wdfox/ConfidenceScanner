The main manifestation is renal angiomyolipoma in the kidney. It is the most common cause of death in adults, because of its high incidence, rapid growth and bleeding. The incidence of this disease is low and the cognition is not enough, so the diagnosis and treatment are lack of standardization. Recently, the expert consensus of the diagnosis and treatment of tuberous sclerosis related renal angiomyolipoma has been established in China. This content fills the gap in this field in China.
