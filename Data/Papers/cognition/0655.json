However, Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related brain entropy mapping based on R-fMRI has not been assessed. Here, we measured the sample entropy and voxel-wise connectivity of the network degree centrality (DC) of the intrinsic brain activity acquired by R-fMRI in 26 patients with AD and 26 healthy controls. Compared with the controls, AD patients showed increased entropy in the middle temporal gyrus and the precentral gyrus and also showed decreased DC in the precuneus. Moreover, the magnitude of the negative correlation between local brain activity (entropy) and network connectivity (DC) was increased in AD patients in comparison with healthy controls. These findings provide new evidence on AD-related brain entropy alterations.", "doi": "10.1097/WNR.0000000000000942", "title": "Increased resting-state brain entropy in Alzheimer's disease.", "journal": ["Neuroreport", "Neuroreport"]}
