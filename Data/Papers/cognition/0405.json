In this paper, we review recent and current work that is driving this field forward. We first outline the Event Horizon Model, which broadly describes the impact of event boundaries on cognition and memory. Then, we address recent work on event segmentation, the role of event cognition in working memory and long-term memory, including event model updating, and long term retention. Throughout we also consider how event cognition varies across individuals and groups of people and consider the neural mechanisms involved.", "doi": "10.1016/j.cobeha.2017.08.006", "title": "Event Boundaries in Memory and Cognition.", "journal": ["Current opinion in behavioral sciences", "Curr Opin Behav Sci"]}
