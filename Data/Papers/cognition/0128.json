TBRS is a mainstream decay-based model and the most susceptible to competition with interference-based models. A connectionist implementation of TBRS, TBRS*, has recently been developed. However, TBRS* is an enriched version of TBRS, making it difficult to test general characteristics resulting from TBRS assumptions. Here, we describe a novel model, TBRS2, built to be more transparent and simple than TBRS*. TBRS2 is minimalist and allows only a few parameters. It is a straightforward mathematical transcription of TBRS that focuses exclusively on the activation level of memory items as a function of time. Its simplicity makes it possible to derive several theorems from the original TBRS and allows several variants of the refresh process to be tested without relying on particular architectures.", "doi": "10.1111/bmsp.12112", "title": "Mathematical transcription of the 'time-based resource sharing' theory of working memory.", "journal": ["The British journal of mathematical and statistical psychology", "Br J Math Stat Psychol"]}
