Given that in Western languages the loudness of tones is often addressed spatially, with loud sounds referred to as \"high\" and quiet sounds referred to as \"low,\" here we investigated whether loudness might also have a spatial representation. Participants judged whether a tone was louder or quieter than a reference tone, by pressing two keys: one at the top and the other at the bottom of a response box. Participants were faster in a situation where they pressed the key at the top to report louder sounds, and the key at the bottom to report quieter sounds, than vice versa. This result supports the view that loudness, like other types of magnitudes, might be represented spatially.", "doi": "10.1177/2041669517742175", "title": "A SMARC Effect for Loudness.", "journal": ["i-Perception", "Iperception"]}
