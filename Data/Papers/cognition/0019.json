Male Wistar rats were topically treated with 5% menthol for 3 or 9 consecutive days, while body mass, food intake, abdominal temperature, metabolism, cutaneous vasoconstriction and thermal preference were measured. Menthol promoted hyperthermia on all days of treatment, due to an increase in metabolism and cutaneous vasoconstriction, without affecting food intake, resulting in less mass gain in menthol-hyperthermic animals. As the treatment progressed, the menthol-induced increases in metabolism and hyperthermia were attenuated, but not abolished. Moreover, cutaneous vasoconstriction was potentiated and an increase in the warmth-seeking behavior was induced. Taken together, the results suggest that, although changes occur in thermoeffector recruitment during the course of short-term treatment, menthol is a promising drug to prevent body mass gain.", "doi": "10.1152/japplphysiol.00770.2017", "title": "SHORT-TERM MENTHOL TREATMENT PROMOTES PERSISTENT THERMOGENESIS WITHOUT INDUCTION OF COMPENSATORY FOOD CONSUMPTION IN RATS: IMPLICATIONS FOR OBESITY CONTROL.", "journal": ["Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)", "J.
