Effective education has always been an integral component of the process of preparing patients to care for themselves post lung transplant. Impaired cognition, anxiety, and psychological distress, however, can decrease the retention of posttransplant care information provided during education sessions.This quality improvement project evaluated whether a multimedia education method compared to standard education method improves posttransplant care knowledge, anxiety, and satisfaction with the education experience in lung transplant patients and their caregivers.Two education methods groups, comprised of transplant patients and their primary caregivers, were compared: (1) historic control group who received the standard education (n = 19 dyads) and (2) multimedia group who received the new multimedia education (n = 18 dyads). Knowledge of posttransplant care was evaluated in both groups before and after receiving the education. A satisfaction survey was administered at the end of the education program.A significantly higher percentage of patients receiving the multimedia method reported gains in posttransplant care knowledge ( P = .05), less anxiety about the transplant surgery ( P = .02), and satisfaction with the education method ( P = .02) when compared to those receiving the standard method. Caregivers and transplant team member also indicated that the multimedia method was more effective than the standard method.Multimedia methods decrease anxiety and increase satisfaction with the education experience when preparing patients for lung transplantation.", "doi": "10.1177/1526924817746910", "title": "Multimedia Education Reduces Anxiety in Lung Transplant Patients.", "journal": ["Progress in transplantation (Aliso Viejo, Calif.)", "Prog Transplant"]}
