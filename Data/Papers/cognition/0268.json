After refusals and excluding residents with severe dementia, 2432 participants remained.Data on demographics, drug use, and medical history were collected by trained nurses using a structured assessment. Psychological well-being (PWB) of participants was assessed by 6 questions resulting in a validated PWB score (range 0-1). Mortality data were retrieved from central registers. The total number of anticholinergic drugs was determined according to the Anticholinergic Risk Scale.Of the participants, 51% used at least 1 DAP. DAP users were younger and had better cognition than nonusers. There was a linear relationship between the number of DAPs used and poorer PWB. A similar trend was present between the number of DAPs and poorer PWB both among those with and without depression and among those with and without functional dependency. No difference in mortality existed between DAP users and nonusers.Despite DAP users being younger and having better cognition, they had poorer PWB. Clinicians should carefully consider the potential benefits and harm when prescribing DAPs to older people.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jamda.2017.11.013", "title": "Use of Anticholinergic Drugs and its Relationship With Psychological Well-Being and Mortality in Long-Term Care Facilities in Helsinki.", "journal": ["Journal of the American Medical Directors Association", "J Am Med Dir Assoc"]}
