Falls during the rehabilitation stay were monitored. Potential predictors were extracted from medical records.Forty-one patients (14%) fell during their rehabilitation stay. The external validity, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), for predicting future fallers was: 0.71 (95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.61-0.81) for OMS (Total_Score); 0.66 (95% CI: 0.57-0.74) for Predict_FIRST; 0.65 (95% CI 0.57-0.73) for PT_Risk; and 0.52 for Past_Falls (95% CI: 0.46-0.60). A simple 3-item tool (Predict_CM2) was developed from the most predictive individual items (impaired mobility/transfer ability, impaired cognition, and male sex). The accuracy of Predict_CM2 was 0.73 (95% CI: 0.66-0.81), comparable to OMS (Total_Score) (p\u2009=\u20090.52), significantly better than Predict_FIRST (p\u2009=\u20090.04), and Past_Falls (p\u2009<\u20090.001), and approaching significantly better than PT_Risk (p\u2009=\u20090.09).Predict_CM2 is a simpler screening tool with similar accuracy for predicting fallers in rehabilitation to OMS (Total_Score) and better accuracy than Predict_FIRST or Past_Falls.
