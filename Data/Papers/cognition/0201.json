In the cyber domain, the influence of emotion on decision-making is rarely investigated. The purpose of this study was to assess psychophysiological correlation with perseverative cognitions during emotionally intensive/stressful situations in cyber military personnel. In line with parallel research on clinical samples high on perseverative cognition, we expected a decreased interoceptive sensitivity in officers with high levels of perseverative cognition.We investigated this association in a sample of 27 cyber officer cadets.Contrary to our hypothesis, there was no relationship between the factors.Cyber officers might display characteristics not otherwise found in general populations. The cyber domain may lead to a selection process that attracts different profiles of cognitive and emotional processing.", "doi": "10.2147/PRBM.S139790", "title": "Interoceptive sensitivity as a proxy for emotional intensity and its relationship with perseverative cognition.", "journal": ["Psychology research and behavior management", "Psychol Res Behav Manag"]}
