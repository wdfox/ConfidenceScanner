Genetic and shared environmental confounding was addressed in intrapair analyses of 48 monozygotic and 74 dizygotic same-sexed twin pairs.In individual-level analyses, twins with major surgery (mean difference,\u00a0-0.37; 95% CI,\u00a0-0.76 to 0.02) or knee and hip replacement surgery (mean difference,\u00a0-0.54; 95% CI,\u00a0-1.30 to 0.22) had a tendency of a negligibly higher rate of decline in cognitive score than the reference group. In the intrapair analyses, the surgery-exposed twin had a higher rate of cognitive decline than the co-twin in 55% (95% CI, 45% to 63%) of the pairs. The mean difference in cognitive decline within pairs was\u00a0-0.21 (95% CI,\u00a0-0.81 to 0.39).No significant associations were found between exposure to surgery and change in cognitive score either in individual-level or in intrapair analyses.", "doi": "10.1016/j.annepidem.2017.12.004", "title": "No impact of surgery on cognitive function: a longitudinal study of middle-aged Danish twins.", "journal": ["Annals of epidemiology", "Ann Epidemiol"]}
