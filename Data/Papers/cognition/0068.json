We also agree that human cognition relies heavily on structured relational representations. However, we differ in our analysis of human cognitive processing. We argue that (1) analogical comparison processes are central to human cognition; and (2) intuitive physical knowledge is captured by qualitative representations, rather than quantitative simulations.", "doi": "10.1017/S0140525X17000139", "title": "Evidence from machines that learn and think like people.", "journal": ["The Behavioral and brain sciences", "Behav Brain Sci"]}
