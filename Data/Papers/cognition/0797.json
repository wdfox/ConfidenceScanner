Results were compared between two anaesthetic groups.On D+1, N1 latency was increased in the IA group. A significant reduction was observed in amplitude of the P3a component on D+6, which persisted up to D+42 for both IA and TIVA groups. A reduction in the amplitude of P3b on D+1 with normalization by D+6 was found in both groups as well.Intravenous and inhalation anaesthesia lead to similar changes in cognitive function as determined by ERPs, both during the early and late postoperative periods. It cannot be clearly confirmed whether the observed effects are due to anaesthesia or other unmonitored perioperative factors.Post anaesthetic changes represent a subclinical impairment; nevertheless, they represent a potential risk for subsequent development of cognitive difficulties.", "doi": "10.1016/j.clinph.2017.10.038", "title": "Cognitive impairment measured by event-related potentials during early and late postoperative period following intravenous or inhalation anaesthesia.", "journal": ["Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "Clin Neurophysiol"]}
