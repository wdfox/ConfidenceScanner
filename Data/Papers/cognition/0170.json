Both projects were aimed at understanding and augmenting choreographic decision-making and both were grounded in research conducted within a leading contemporary dance company. In each case, the work drew upon methods and theory from the cognitive sciences, and both had a direct impact on the way in which the company made new work. In the synthesis presented here the concept of an audit trace is introduced. Audit traces identify how specific classes of knowledge are used and transformed not only within the arts or sciences but also when arts practice is informed by science or when arts practice informs science.", "doi": "10.1080/03080188.2017.1381226", "title": "Mapping the audit traces of interdisciplinary collaboration: bridging and blending between choreography and cognitive science.", "journal": ["Interdisciplinary science reviews : ISR", "Interdiscip Sci Rev"]}
