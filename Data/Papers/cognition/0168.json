We tested recognition memory for color in Bolivia's indigenous Tsiman\u00e8 people, who experience a different color environment than standard U.S.We found that memory regressed differently between the groups, lending credence to the idea that environmental variations engender differences in expectations, and in turn perceptual memory for color.", "doi": "10.1177/2041669517750161", "title": "Seeing Colors: Cultural and Environmental Influences on Episodic Memory.", "journal": ["i-Perception", "Iperception"]}
