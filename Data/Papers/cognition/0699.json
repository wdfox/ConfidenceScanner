Patients with SCD are those who visited the memory clinic with subjective cognitive complaints without objective cognitive impairment. Whole-brain CBF (mL/100\u00a0g/min) was calculated using total volume flow measured with two-dimensional phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging and normalized for brain volume.Mean CBF values (SD) were lower in AD compared to SCD (age and sex adjusted 70\u00a0\u00b1\u00a026 vs. 82\u00a0\u00b1\u00a024\u00a0mL/100\u00a0g/min, P\u00a0<\u00a0.05). Mean CBF values of MCI were comparable to AD. Across clinical groups, lower CBF was associated with lower scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination (age and sex adjusted st\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.19 per mL/100\u00a0g/min; P\u00a0=\u00a0.02).Lower whole-brain CBF is seen in AD patients compared to SCD patients and is associated with worse cognitive function.", "doi": "10.1016/j.dadm.2017.10.001", "title": "Lower cerebral blood flow in subjects with Alzheimer's dementia, mild cognitive impairment, and subjective cognitive decline using two-dimensional phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging.", "journal": ["Alzheimer's & dementia (Amsterdam, Netherlands)", "Alzheimers Dement (Amst)"]}
