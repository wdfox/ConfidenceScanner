HE was determined by serum ammonia level and number connection test (NCT)-A. Changes in whole blood endotoxin activity (EA) was analyzed by endotoxin activity assay. Fecal microbiome was assessed by 16S ribosome RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing.Treatment with rifaximin for 4 wk improved hyperammonemia (from 90.6 \u00b1 23.9 \u03bcg/dL to 73.1 \u00b1 33.1 \u03bcg/dL; P < 0.05) and time required for NCT (from 68.2 \u00b1 17.4 s to 54.9 \u00b1 20.3 s; P < 0.05) in patients who had higher levels at baseline. Endotoxin activity was reduced (from 0.43 \u00b1 0.03 to 0.32 \u00b1 0.09; P < 0.05) in direct correlation with decrease in serum ammonia levels (r = 0.5886, P < 0.05). No statistically significant differences were observed in the diversity estimator (Shannon diversity index) and major components of the gut microbiome between the baseline and after treatment groups (3.948 \u00b1 0.548 at baseline vs 3.980 \u00b1 0.968 after treatment; P = 0.544), but the relative abundances of genus Veillonella and Streptococcus were lowered.Rifaximin significantly improved cognition and reduced endotoxin activity without significantly affecting the composition of the gut microbiome in patients with decompensated cirrhosis.", "doi": "10.3748/wjg.v23.i47.8355", "title": "Rifaximin ameliorates hepatic encephalopathy and endotoxemia without affecting the gut microbiome diversity.", "journal": ["World journal of gastroenterology", "World J.
