With increasing body of literature discussing the role of M(4) MR some controversies arose. Thus, we try here to summarize the current evidence regarding the M(4) MR, with the special focus on their role in Locomotor activity control. We review the molecular function of M(4) MR in specific brain areas implicated in locomotor regulation, and shortly in other CNS processes that could be connected to locomotor activity. We also focus on brain areas implicated in locomotor activity biorhythm changes like suprachiasmatic nucleus, subparaventricular zone posterior hypothalamic area, striatum and thalamus. Gender-related aspects and differences in locomotor activity in males and females are discussed further.", "doi": null, "title": "M(4) muscarinic receptors and locomotor activity regulation.", "journal": ["Physiological research", "Physiol Res"]}
