Methods: A total of 18 T2DM patients with normal cognitive function (NCI group) and 40 T2DM patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI group) treated in outpatient clinic or ward of Department of Neurology and Endocrinology in Fujian Medical University Union Hospital between January 2015 and February 2016 were enrolled. Mini Mental State Scale (MMSE), Montreal cognitive assessment scale (MoCA), Activity of Daily Living Scale (ADL) and the Chinese version of ACE-\u2162 were used to assess cognitive function of subjects and to assess the value of ACE-\u2162 in the diagnosis of T2DM patients with mild cognitive impairment. Results: The Cronbach's alpha of the Chinese version of ACE-\u2162 is 0.768. ACE-\u2162 and MoCA were correlative (r=0.768, P<0.001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for ACE-\u2162 was 0.906 (95%CI: 0.827-0.985). When the cut-off value for diagnosis was 87.5, the maximum Youden index was 0.769, with a sensitivity of 0.825 and a specificity of 0.944. Patients in MCI group got a lower score in the sub-items of attention/orientation, memory, verbal fluency, language and visual space of ACE-\u2162 compared to those in NCI group, and the differences were statistically significant (t=5.336, P<0.001; t=5.530, P<0.001; t=4.556, P<0.001; t=5.301, P<0.001; t=2.821, P=0.008). Conclusion: The Chinese version of ACE-\u2162 had good internal consistency reliability, and it could effectively detect impairment of general cognitive function and single cognitive domains in T2DM patients.\u76ee\u7684\uff1a \u63a2\u8ba8\u4e2d\u6587\u7248Addenbrooke\u8ba4\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u91cf\u8868\u2162(ACE\uff0d\u2162)\u57282\u578b\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u8f7b\u5ea6\u8ba4\u77e5\u969c\u788d\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u53ca\u5176\u6700\u4f73\u4e34\u754c\u503c\u3002 \u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a \u7eb3\u51652015\u5e741\u6708\u81f32016\u5e742\u6708\u5728\u798f\u5efa\u533b\u79d1\u5927\u5b66\u9644\u5c5e\u534f\u548c\u533b\u9662\u795e\u7ecf\u5185\u79d1\u53ca\u5185\u5206\u6ccc\u79d1\u95e8\u8bca\u6216\u75c5\u623f\u5c31\u8bca\u768418\u4f8b2\u578b\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u8ba4\u77e5\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u5e38\u60a3\u8005(NCI\u7ec4)\u300140\u4f8b2\u578b\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u8f7b\u5ea6\u8ba4\u77e5\u969c\u788d\u60a3\u8005(MCI\u7ec4)\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u7b80\u6613\u7cbe\u795e\u72b6\u6001\u8bc4\u5b9a\u91cf\u8868(MMSE)\u3001\u8499\u7279\u5229\u5c14\u8ba4\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u91cf\u8868(MoCA)\u3001\u65e5\u5e38\u751f\u6d3b\u80fd\u529b\u91cf\u8868(ADL)\u548c\u4e2d\u6587\u7248ACE\uff0d\u2162\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30ACE\uff0d\u2162\u57282\u578b\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u8f7b\u5ea6\u8ba4\u77e5\u969c\u788d\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002 \u7ed3\u679c\uff1a \u4e2d\u6587\u7248ACE\uff0d\u2162\u91cf\u8868\u7684Cronbach\u2032s \u03b1\u7cfb\u6570\u4e3a0.768\uff1bACE\uff0d\u2162\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0eMoCA\u8bc4\u5206\u5448\u6b63\u76f8\u5173(r\uff1d0.768, P<0.001)\uff0cACE\uff0d\u2162\u8bc6\u522b2\u578b\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u8f7b\u5ea6\u8ba4\u77e5\u969c\u788d\u7684\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u5de5\u4f5c\u7279\u5f81(ROC)\u66f2\u7ebf\u4e0b\u9762\u79ef\u4e3a0.906(95%CI\uff1a0.827\uff5e0.985)\uff1b\u5f53ACE\uff0d\u2162\u8bca\u65ad\u754c\u503c\u4e3a87.5\u5206\u65f6\u7ea6\u767b\u6307\u6570\u6700\u5927\uff0c\u4e3a0.769\uff0c\u6b64\u65f6\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u4e3a0.825\uff0c\u7279\u5f02\u5ea6\u4e3a0.944\uff1bMCI\u7ec4\u5728ACE\uff0d\u2162\u6ce8\u610f/\u5b9a\u5411\u3001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u6d41\u5229\u6027\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u89c6\u7a7a\u95f4\u5404\u5b50\u9879\u76ee\u4e0a\u5206\u6570\u5747\u4f4e\u4e8eNCI\u7ec4\uff0c\u5dee\u5f02\u5747\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49(t\uff1d5.336\uff0cP<0.001\uff1bt\uff1d5.530\uff0cP<0.001\uff1bt\uff1d4.556\uff0cP<0.001\uff1bt\uff1d5.301\uff0cP<0.001\uff1bt\uff1d2.821\uff0cP\uff1d0.008)\u3002 \u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a \u4e2d\u6587\u7248ACE\uff0d\u2162\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u597d\u7684\u5185\u5728\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5730\u68c0\u6d4b\u51fa2\u578b\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u603b\u4f53\u8ba4\u77e5\u529f\u80fd\u548c\u5404\u8ba4\u77e5\u57df\u7684\u635f\u5bb3\u3002.", "doi": null, "title": "[Application of Chinese version of ACE-\u2162 in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with mild cognitive impairment].", "journal": ["Zhonghua yi xue za zhi", "Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi"]}
