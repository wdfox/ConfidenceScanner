We performed a genome-wide association study of DD using 23,127 research participants of European ancestry. The most significantly associated single-nucleotide polymorphism was rs6528024 (P\u2009=\u20092.40\u2009\u00d7\u200910-8), which is located in an intron of the gene GPM6B. We also showed that 12% of the variance in DD was accounted for by genotype and that the genetic signature of DD overlapped with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, major depression, smoking, personality, cognition and body weight.", "doi": "10.1038/s41593-017-0032-x", "title": "Genome-wide association study of delay discounting in 23,217 adult research participants of European ancestry.", "journal": ["Nature neuroscience", "Nat.
