At baseline, 0% of admission and discharge notes met minimum documentation criteria for all 3 domains (function, cognition, ACP). Documentation of function and cognition was completely absent at baseline. After the intervention, there was marked improvement in all measures, with 64% of admission notes and 94% of discharge notes meeting minimum documentation criteria or better in all 3 domains.A quality improvement intervention using geriatric-specific note templates, housestaff training, and reminders increased documentation of function, cognition and ACP for postacute care.", "doi": "10.1111/jgs.15237", "title": "Handing Off the Older Patient: Improved Documentation of Geriatric Assessment in Transitions of Care.", "journal": ["Journal of the American Geriatrics Society", "J Am Geriatr Soc"]}
