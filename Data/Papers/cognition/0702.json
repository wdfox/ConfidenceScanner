Indirubins could inhibit various kinases, and might be used to treat chronic myelocytic leukemia, cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. 7-bromoindirubin-3-oxime (7Bio), an indirubin derivative derived from indirubin-3-oxime, possesses inhibitory effects against cyclin-dependent kinase-5 (CDK5) and glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2), two pharmacological targets of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we have discovered that 2.3-23.3 \u03bcg/kg 7Bio effectively prevented \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) oligomer-induced impairments of spatial cognition and recognition without affecting bodyweight and motor functions in mice. Moreover, 7Bio potently inhibited A\u03b2 oligomer-induced expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). Furthermore, 7Bio significantly prevented the decreased expression of synapsin-1 and PSD-95, biomarkers of pre-synaptic and post-synaptic proteins in A\u03b2 oligomer-treated mice. The mean optical density (OD) with hyper-phosphorylated tau (pTau), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and CD45 positive staining in the hippocampus of 7Bio-treated mice were significantly decreased compared to those of A\u03b2 oligomer-treated mice. In addition, Western blotting analysis showed that 7Bio attenuated A\u03b2 oligomer-decreased expression of pSer9-GSK3\u03b2. Those results suggested that 7Bio could potently inhibit A\u03b2 oligomer-induced neuroinflammation, synaptic impairments, tau hyper-phosphorylation, and activation of astrocytes and microglia, which may contribute to the neuroprotective effects of 7Bio. Based on these findings, we expected that 7Bio might be developed as a novel anti-AD lead compound.", "doi": "10.3389/fnmol.2017.00393", "title": "Indirubin Derivative 7-Bromoindirubin-3-Oxime (7Bio) Attenuates A\u03b2 Oligomer-Induced Cognitive Impairments in Mice.", "journal": ["Frontiers in molecular neuroscience", "Front Mol Neurosci"]}
