However, Lake et al.'s proposed biases may not directly map onto mechanisms in the developing brain. A convergence of fields may soon create a correspondence between biological neural circuits and optimization in structured architectures, allowing us to systematically dissect how brains learn.", "doi": "10.1017/S0140525X17000218", "title": "Understand the cogs to understand cognition.", "journal": ["The Behavioral and brain sciences", "Behav Brain Sci"]}
