The BICAMS was re-administered in a subset of 27 MS patients and 30 HCs.The mean (\u00b1SD) raw scores in the MS and HC groups were as follows: SDMT: MS 47.9\u2009\u00b1\u200914.0, HC 61.0\u2009\u00b1\u20099.5; CVLT2: MS 48.6\u2009\u00b1\u200912.6, HC 55.7\u2009\u00b1\u200910.5; BVMTR: MS 23.5\u2009\u00b1\u20098.4, HC 28.3\u2009\u00b1\u20095.4, respectively, and significant differences were found between the two groups on all tests (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Cohen's d values were 1.07, 0.60, and 0.67 in SDMT, CVLT2, and BVMTR, respectively. The test-retest reliability coefficients for each test were as follows: SDMT: r\u2009=\u20090.93; CVLT2: r\u2009=\u20090.82; and BVMTR: r\u2009=\u20090.77 (p\u2009<\u20090.0001).This study provides results that support the reliability and validity of the BICAMS in Japan.", "doi": "10.1177/2055217317748972", "title": "Validation of the Brief International Cognitive Assessment for Multiple Sclerosis in Japan.", "journal": ["Multiple sclerosis journal - experimental, translational and clinical", "Mult Scler J Exp Transl Clin"]}
