The main purpose of the study was to check the difference in the meta-moral cognitive abilities between those students who studied a course on professional ethics, as part of the engineering curriculum, and those who did not undertake such a course. Using the survey method, the author conducted a pilot study amongst 243 engineering undergraduates. The meta-moral cognitive awareness inventory developed on the basis of the meta-cognitive awareness inventory prepared by Schraw Gregory and Dennison Rayne Sperling was used to measure the meta-moral cognitive level of the respondents. The results show that there was a substantial difference in the meta-moral cognitive abilities between those students who studied professional ethics, and those who did not. The univariate analysis of variance of the collected data reveals a significant variance (p\u00a0=\u00a0.017).", "doi": "10.1007/s11948-017-0009-x", "title": "Does Studying 'Ethics' Improve Engineering Students' Meta-Moral Cognitive Skills?", "journal": ["Science and engineering ethics", "Sci Eng Ethics"]}
