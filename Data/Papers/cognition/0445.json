There is a need to explore the use of exergames for LTC residents who have mobility and cognitive impairments. We investigated the effect of a group-based Xbox Kinect (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA) exergame program on mobility in LTC residents with and without cognitive impairment.Facilities were randomly assigned to the intervention (four facilities, n\u2009=\u200929, aged 84.7\u2009\u00b1\u20097.4 years) or control group (five facilities, n\u2009=\u200936, aged 85.8\u2009\u00b1\u20097.2 years). The intervention group played Xbox Kinect exergames twice weekly for 8 weeks. The control group continued usual activities. The primary outcome measure was mobility, assessed pre- and postintervention using the de Morton Mobility Index (DEMMI).DEMMI scores improved in residents who played exergames, although this did not reach significance (P\u2009=\u20090.06). There was no interaction between cognition scores and DEMMI scores (P\u2009=\u20090.86). Participants attended an average of 55% of scheduled exergames sessions.The trend toward improvement in mobility, as well as attendance rates indicate that the Xbox Kinect exergames were engaging for a proportion of residents. On this basis, further exergames development for LTC residents warrants attention.", "doi": "10.1089/g4h.2017.0084", "title": "Exergames to Improve the Mobility of Long-Term Care Residents: A Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial.", "journal": ["Games for health journal", "Games Health J"]}
