Additionally, hierarchical regression analyses found that four types of negative thoughts partially mediated the stress-burnout relationship.We concluded that an athlete's negative thoughts play a pivotal role in predicting athletes' stress-burnout relationship. Future study may examine how irrational cognition influences athletes' motivation and psychological well-being.", "doi": "10.7717/peerj.4181", "title": "Examining the stress-burnout relationship: the mediating role of negative thoughts.", "journal": ["PeerJ", "PeerJ"]}
