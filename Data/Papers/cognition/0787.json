Pooled correlation coefficients were calculated between hemisphere (left, right or total) and type of recall (immediate or delayed) for each diagnostic group individually (SCZ, GHR and HC). In SCZ, left and right hippocampal volume positively correlated with immediate (r=0.256, 0.230) and delayed (r=0.132, 0.231) verbal recall. There was also a correlation between total hippocampal volume and delayed recall (r=0.233). None of these correlations were significant in healthy controls. There was however, a positive correlation between left hippocampal volume and immediate recall in the GHR group (r=0.356). The results suggest that hippocampal volume affects immediate and delayed verbal learning capacity in schizophrenia and provides further evidence of hippocampal dysfunction in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.", "doi": "10.1016/j.neubiorev.2017.12.001", "title": "Verbal learning and hippocampal dysfunction in schizophrenia: A meta-analysis.", "journal": ["Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews", "Neurosci Biobehav Rev"]}
