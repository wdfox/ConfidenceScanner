Only noncustodial grandparents who reported not living with their grandchildren over the three waves were included in our analyses. Grandparent caregiving status and cognition were assessed in 2006, 2008, and 2010. Analyses controlled for demographics, baseline health, depressive symptoms, and baseline cognition.Both the number of waves of grandparent caregiving and the total number of grandparent caregiving hours across the three waves were associated with better cognitive functioning at 4-year follow-up in 2010. Associations were observed among Whites, but not among African Americans.This study uses longitudinal data to evaluate the association between grandparent caregiving and cognitive functioning. Findings suggest that providing care may be beneficial for some grandparents.", "doi": "10.1177/0898264317733362", "title": "Grandparent Caregiving, Race, and Cognitive Functioning in a Population-Based Sample of Older Adults.", "journal": ["Journal of aging and health", "J Aging Health"]}
