Defects in excitatory and inhibitory synapses have been implicated in schizophrenia, likely contributing to positive and negative symptoms as well as impaired cognition. Recently, accumulating evidence has suggested that bioenergetic systems, important in both synaptic function and cognition, are abnormal in psychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia. Animal models of synaptic dysfunction demonstrated endophenotypes of schizophrenia as well as bioenergetic abnormalities. We report findings on the bioenergetic interplay of astrocytes and neurons and discuss how dysregulation of these pathways may contribute to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, highlighting metabolic systems as important therapeutic targets.", "doi": "10.1016/j.biopsych.2017.10.014", "title": "Defects in Bioenergetic Coupling in Schizophrenia.", "journal": ["Biological psychiatry", "Biol.
