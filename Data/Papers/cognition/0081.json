We point out that their proposal is incomplete and implausible: incomplete, as it does not explain how continuous magnitudes are calculated; implausible, as it cannot explain performance in estimation tasks. We propose that we do not possess a number sense. Instead, we assume that numerosity judgments are accomplished by weighing the different continuous magnitudes constituting numerosity.", "doi": "10.1017/S0140525X16002107", "title": "Why try saving the ANS?
