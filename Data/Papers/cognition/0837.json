An analysis on the impact of research conducted from this perspective over the last 3decades has been carried out, including its shortcomings, as well as the potential directions and usefulness that will advantageously continue to drive this discipline in its description and explanation of the process es of cerebral and cognitive aging.", "doi": "10.1016/j.regg.2017.07.002", "title": "[Cognitive neuroscience of aging.
