As part of the International Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorder Society-sponsored project to review all clinical rating scales used in Huntington's disease, a systematic review of the literature was performed to identify cognitive scales used in Huntington's disease and make recommendations for their use. A total of 17 cognitive scales were identified and evaluated. None of the scales met criteria for a \"recommended\" status. For assessing severity of cognitive dysfunction, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment was \"recommended with caveats.\" The UHDRS Cognitive Assessment, the UHDRS-For Advanced Patients cognitive section, the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale, the Frontal Assessment Battery, the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, the Mini-Mental State Examination, and the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status were \"suggested\" for evaluating severity of cognitive impairment. The MoCA was \"suggested\" as a screening tool for cognitive impairment. The major challenge in the assessment of cognition in Huntington's disease is the lack of a formal definition of dementia and/or mild cognitive impairment in this disease. The committee concluded that there is a need to further validate currently available cognitive scales in Huntington's disease, but that it is premature to recommend the development of new scales. Recently developed Huntington's disease-specific scales, such as the Huntington's Disease-Cognitive Assessment Battery, hold promise but require the completion of more comprehensive clinimetric development. \u00a9 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.", "doi": "10.1002/mds.27227", "title": "Rating scales for cognition in Huntington's disease: Critique and recommendations.", "journal": ["Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "Mov.
