Previous studies reported enhanced Nav\u03b22 processing by BACE1 in Alzheimer's disease (AD) model and patients. We investigated whether changes in Nav\u03b22 expression affect neuronal seizure and amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing in an AD mouse model. Our study used eight-month-old APP/presenilin 1 (PS1) mice and transgenic Nav\u03b22 knockdown [by 61% vs. wild type (WT)] APP/PS1 mice (APP/PS1/Nav\u03b22-kd), with age-matched WT and Nav\u03b22 knockdown (Nav\u03b22-kd) mice as controls. We found that Nav\u03b22 knockdown in APP/PS1 mice partially reversed the abnormal Nav\u03b22 cleavage and the changes in intracellular and total Nav1.1\u03b1 expression. It also restored sodium currents density in hippocampal neurons and neuronal activity, as indicated by EEG tracing; improved Morris water maze performance; and shifted APP amyloidogenic metabolism towards non-amyloidogenic processing. There were no differences in these indicators between WT and Nav\u03b22-kd mice. These results suggest Nav\u03b22 knockdown may be a promising strategy for treating AD.", "doi": "10.18632/oncotarget.21849", "title": "Nav\u03b22 knockdown improves cognition in APP/PS1 mice by partially inhibiting seizures and APP amyloid processing.", "journal": ["Oncotarget", "Oncotarget"]}
