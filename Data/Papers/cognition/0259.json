At 6.5\u00a0years, 84 preterm children and a reference group of 64 full-term children underwent ophthalmological testing.Mean visual acuity (VA) did not differ between the groups, but subnormal VA (\u22640.8) was more common in the preterm group (31% vs 14%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). More often than full-term children, preterm children had impaired contrast sensitivity (<0.5) (36% vs 19%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and strabismus (8% vs 0%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Low GA, ROP, intraventricular haemorrhage 3-4/periventricular leukomalacia and cognitive disability at 2.5\u00a0years predicted ophthalmological and visual problems at 6.5\u00a0years. Visual tracking ability at four months was not predictive of ophthalmological outcome.Children born preterm had more ophthalmological problems at 6.5\u00a0years of age, including subtle dysfunctions. ROP, early brain injury and impaired cognitive function around 2.5\u00a0years predicted later ophthalmological dysfunctions.", "doi": "10.1111/apa.14209", "title": "Impaired cognitive ability at 2.5\u00a0years predicts later visual and ophthalmological problems in children born very preterm.", "journal": ["Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)", "Acta Paediatr."]}
