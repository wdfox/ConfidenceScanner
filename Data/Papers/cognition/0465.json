Ninety-nine HIV+\u00a0and 46 HIV- older adults (\u2265\u00a050\u00a0years) completed measures of neurocognition, positive psychological factors, and HRQoL. Using study-defined SCA criteria (i.e., no cognitive or everyday impairment or major depressive disorder), we compared positive psychological factors and HRQoL across four groups: HIV+/SCA+, HIV+/SCA-, HIV-/SCA+, HIV-/SCA-. SCA was identified in 29% of the HIV+\u00a0sample compared to 61% of the HIV- sample (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). HIV+/SCA+ participants had higher scores on 8 of 10 measures of positive psychological factors as well as better HRQoL (ps\u00a0<\u00a00.05) as compared to the HIV+/SCA- group. Furthermore, the HIV+/SCA+\u00a0participants had comparable scores on these factors as HIV- adults. Fewer HIV+\u00a0than HIV- participants met SCA criteria; however, the level of positive psychological factors among the HIV+/SCA+\u00a0group was comparable to the HIV- sample. Our findings present opportunities for interventions to optimize positive psychological factors and potentially improve SCA among older HIV+\u00a0adults.", "doi": "10.1007/s10461-017-2001-5", "title": "Positive Psychological Factors are Linked to Successful Cognitive Aging Among Older Persons Living with HIV/AIDS.", "journal": ["AIDS and behavior", "AIDS Behav"]}
