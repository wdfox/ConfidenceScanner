Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to attain volumetric measures of limbic and basal ganglia structures. Quantitative motion analysis was used to measure spatiotemporal parameters of gait. The Trail Making Test was used to assess executive function.During fast paced walking, older adults with aMCI demonstrated significantly slower gait speed and shorter stride length compare to older adults with NC. Stride length was positively correlated with hippocampal, anterior cingulate, and nucleus accumbens volumes (P < 0.05). Executive function was positively correlated with hippocampal, anterior cingulate, and posterior cingulate volumes (P < 0.05).Compared to older adults with NC, those with aMCI demonstrated slower gait speed and shorter stride length, during fast-pace walking, and lower executive function. Hippocampal and anterior cingulate volumes demonstrated moderate positive correlation with both gait and executive function, after adjusting for age.", "doi": "10.1097/PHM.0000000000000881", "title": "Limbic and Basal Ganglia Neuroanatomical Correlates of Gait and Executive Function: Older Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment and Intact Cognition.", "journal": ["American journal of physical medicine & rehabilitation", "Am J Phys Med Rehabil"]}
