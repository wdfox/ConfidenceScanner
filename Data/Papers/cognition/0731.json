These evaluations are dynamic, as specific associations become more or less active in people's minds over time. We investigated how evaluations of colors (color preferences) changed over the course of fall, as color-associated fall entities became more prevalent in the environment. Participants judged their preferences for the same set of colors during nine testing sessions over 11 weeks during fall. We categorized the colors as Leaf and Non-Leaf Colors by matching them to leaves collected during the same period. Changes in preferences for Leaf Colors followed a quadratic pattern, peaking around when the leaves were most colorful and declining as winter approached. Preferences for Non-Leaf Colors did not significantly change. Individual differences in these changes could be explained by preferences for seasonal entities, as predicted by the differential activation hypothesis within the Ecological Valence Theory. The more a given individual liked fall-associated entities, the more their preference for Leaf Colors increased during fall. No analogous relations existed with winter-associated entities or Non-Leaf Colors. These results demonstrate the importance of studying temporal and individual differences for understanding preferences.", "doi": "10.1177/2041669517742177", "title": "Seasonal Changes in Color Preferences Are Linked to Variations in Environmental Colors: A Longitudinal Study of Fall.", "journal": ["i-Perception", "Iperception"]}
