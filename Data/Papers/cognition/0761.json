This study employed a comprehensive cognitive battery to compare the performance of individuals diagnosed with a cocaine use disorder (N\u00a0=\u00a03 abusers, N\u00a0=\u00a017 dependent) against the performance of two control groups: (a) non-drug-users, and (b) marijuana users who report no cocaine use (N\u00a0=\u00a07 marijuana abusers, N\u00a0=\u00a00 dependent, N\u00a0=\u00a013 marijuana users with no Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition, DSM-IV, diagnosis).This one-session, between-participants, outpatient study was conducted at the New York State Psychiatric Institute. Sixty research volunteers completed the study. Drug users in both groups had no signs of current intoxication, but had a positive urine toxicology-which indicated use within 72\u00a0hours in the cocaine use disorder group and within the past 30\u00a0days (depending on frequency of use) for the marijuana-using control group. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Toolbox Cognition Battery was used to assess cognitive functioning across six domains: executive function, attention, episodic memory, working memory, processing speed, and language. Each participant's score was also compared against a normative database adjusted for age.Although the mean cognitive scores for all groups fell within the normal range for all tests, marijuana-using control participants outperformed those with a cocaine use disorder on a cognitive flexibility and language measure.Cognitive functioning of individuals diagnosed with cocaine use disorder was observed to be similar to that of control group participants on the majority of tasks and fell within the normal range when compared against normative data.", "doi": "10.1080/13803395.2017.1403569", "title": "Assessing cognitive functioning in individuals with cocaine use disorder.", "journal": ["Journal of clinical and experimental neuropsychology", "J Clin Exp Neuropsychol"]}
