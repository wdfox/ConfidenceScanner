Seventy-five cognitively healthy participants who progressed to MCI were followed for 4\u00a0years on average and up to 10\u00a0years. We tested effects of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) on measures of cognition, functional status, depressive symptoms, and brain structure and metabolism. Preclinical AD subjects showed greater cognitive decline in multiple domains and increased cerebrospinal fluid phosphorylated tau levels at baseline while A\u03b2-negative progressors showed increased rates of white matter hyperintensity accumulation and had a greater frequency of depressive symptoms at baseline. A\u03b2 status did not influence patterns of brain atrophy, but preclinical AD subjects showed greater decline of brain metabolism than A\u03b2-negative progressors. Several unique features separate the transition from preclinical to prodromal AD from other causes of cognitive decline. These features may facilitate early diagnosis and treatment of AD, especially in clinical trials aimed at halting the progression from preclinical to prodromal AD.", "doi": "10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2017.12.018", "title": "Amyloid pathology in the progression to mild cognitive impairment.", "journal": ["Neurobiology of aging", "Neurobiol.
