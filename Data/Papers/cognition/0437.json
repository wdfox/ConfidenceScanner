Several observational studies and clinical trials have analysed this relation and they differ in the findings, especially for children's language-related skills and IQ. Physical activity assessment, amount of physical activity and the test used for measuring children's cognition could affect this relation, as well as other factors that should be considered. This article will review the evidence on the effects of physical activity during pregnancy on children's different cognitive domains.Leisure physical during pregnancy positively affects offspring's general intelligence and language skills.", "doi": "10.1111/1471-0528.15108", "title": "Pregnancy leisure physical activity and children's neurodevelopment: a narrative review.", "journal": ["BJOG : an international journal of obstetrics and gynaecology", "BJOG"]}
