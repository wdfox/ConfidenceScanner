Planning of exploration is based on the validity of the hypotheses developed from electroclinical and imaging correlations. Further investigations can refine the implantation plan (e.g. fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography [FDG-PET], single photon emission computerized tomography [SPECT], magnetoencephalography [MEG] and high resolution electroencephalography [EEG-HR]). The scheme is individualized according to the features of each clinical case, but a general approach can be systematized according to the regions involved (temporal versus extra-temporal), the existence of a lesion, its type and extent. It takes account of the hemispheric dominance for language if this can be determined. In \"temporal plus\" epilepsies, perisylvian and insular regions are among the key structures to investigate in addition to mesial and neocortical temporal areas. In frontal lobe epilepsies, determining the functional and anatomical organization of seizures (anterior versus posterior, mesial versus dorsolateral) allows better targeting of the implantation. Posterior epilepsies tend to have a complex organization leading to multilobar and often bilateral explorations. In lesional cases, it may be useful to implant one or several intralesional electrode(s), except in cases of vascular lesions or cyst. The strategy of implantation can be modified if thermocoagulations are considered. The management of SEEG implies continuous monitoring in a dedicated environment to determine the EZ with optimal safety conditions. This methodology includes spontaneous seizure recordings, low and high frequency stimulations and, if possible, sleep recording. SEEG is applicable in children, even the very young. Specific training of medical and paramedical teams is required.", "doi": "10.1016/j.neucli.2017.11.007", "title": "Planning and management of SEEG.", "journal": ["Neurophysiologie clinique = Clinical neurophysiology", "Neurophysiol Clin"]}
