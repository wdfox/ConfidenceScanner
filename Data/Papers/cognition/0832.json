In their comment, crucial model features are misrepresented, misunderstood, or ignored. Sensitivity to the supply/demand ratio explains both the equilibrium concentrations and the selection for lower concentrations by larger pollinators.", "doi": "10.1126/science.aao2622", "title": "Response to Comment on \"Cognition-mediated evolution of low-quality floral nectars\".", "journal": ["Science (New York, N.Y.)", "Science"]}
