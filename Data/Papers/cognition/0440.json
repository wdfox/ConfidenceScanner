This study evaluated a web-based cognitive rehabilitation therapy program (eReCog) in cancer survivors compared to a waitlist control group.Adult cancer survivors with self-reported cognitive symptoms who had completed primary treatment at least 6 months prior were recruited. Participants completed telephone screening and were randomly allocated to the 4-week online intervention or waitlist. Primary outcome was perceived cognitive impairment assessed with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Cognitive Function version 3. Secondary outcomes were additional measures of subjective cognitive functioning, objective cognitive functioning and psychosocial variables.76 women were allocated to the intervention (n=40) or waitlist (n=36). A significant interaction was found on the instrumental activities of daily living measure of self-reported prospective memory whereby the intervention group reported a greater reduction in prospective memory failures than the waitlist group. Interaction trends were noted on Perceived Cognitive Impairments (p=.089) and Executive Functioning (p=.074). No significant interactions were observed on other measures of objective cognitive functioning or psychosocial variables.The web-based intervention shows promise for improving self-reported cognitive functioning in adult cancer survivors. Further research is warranted to better understand the mechanisms by which the intervention might contribute to improved self-reported cognition.", "doi": "10.1002/pon.4615", "title": "Web-Based Cognitive Rehabilitation for Survivors of Adult Cancer: A Randomised Controlled Trial.", "journal": ["Psycho-oncology", "Psychooncology"]}
