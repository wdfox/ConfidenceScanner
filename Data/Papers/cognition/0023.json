However, that is what happens in some cases. Previous neuropolitics studies have found that liberals are more adept at dealing with novel information than conservatives. This finding suggests that conservatives and liberals possess different cognitive skills. For the purposes of this article, two studies were executed to test whether this difference remained in alternative environmental settings. To this end, two novel cognitive tasks were designed in which one type of ideology or another was privileged according to the cognitive environment created by the tasks. Experimental findings indicate that liberals committed fewer errors than conservatives in one kind of cognitive environment, while conservatives scored higher in another.", "doi": "10.1017/pls.2017.17", "title": "Conservatism and liberalism predict performance in two nonideological cognitive tasks.", "journal": ["Politics and the life sciences : the journal of the Association for Politics and the Life Sciences", "Politics Life Sci"]}
