Few studies examined effects on clinical Alzheimer-type dementia or MCI, and those that did suggested no benefit. Daily folic acid plus vitamin B12 was associated with improvements in performance on some objectively measured memory tests that were statistically significant but of questionable clinical significance. Moderate-strength evidence showed that vitamin E had no benefit on cognition. Evidence about effects of \u03c9-3 fatty acids, soy, ginkgo biloba, folic acid alone or with other B vitamins, \u03b2-carotene, vitamin C, vitamin D plus calcium, and multivitamins or multi-ingredient supplements was either insufficient or low-strength, suggesting that these supplements did not reduce risk for cognitive decline. Adverse events were rarely reported.Studies had high attrition and short follow-up and used a highly variable set of cognitive outcome measures.Evidence is insufficient to recommend any OTC supplement for cognitive protection in adults with normal cognition or MCI.Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.", "doi": "10.7326/M17-1530", "title": "Over-the-Counter Supplement Interventions to Prevent Cognitive Decline, Mild Cognitive Impairment, and Clinical Alzheimer-Type Dementia: A Systematic Review.", "journal": ["Annals of internal medicine", "Ann.
