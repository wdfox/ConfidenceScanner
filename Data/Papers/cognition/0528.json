Across these four domains, available evidence demonstrates that emotion- and memory-related medial temporal lobe brain regions (amygdala and hippocampus, respectively), together with prefrontal cortical regions, play a pivotal role during both encoding and retrieval of emotional episodic memories. This evidence sheds light on the neural mechanisms of emotional memories in healthy functioning, and has important implications for understanding clinical conditions that are associated with negative affective biases in encoding and retrieving emotional memories.", "doi": "10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01867", "title": "Emerging Directions in Emotional Episodic Memory.", "journal": ["Frontiers in psychology", "Front Psychol"]}
