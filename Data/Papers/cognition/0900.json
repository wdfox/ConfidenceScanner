Yet, its research on suicidal behaviors has been primitive. While the Interpersonal Psychological Theory of Suicide has gained global attention, there has only been a few researches, which examined its applicability in Korea. In this article, we review the previous studies on suicide and examine the association between the Interpersonal Psychological Theory of Suicide and traditional Korean culture, with an emphasis on Collectivism and Confucianism. We propose that pathways to suicide might vary depending on cultural influences. Clinical implications and suggestions for future research will be discussed.", "doi": "10.4306/pi.2017.14.6.713", "title": "The Influence of Traditional Culture and the Interpersonal Psychological Theory on Suicide Research in Korea.", "journal": ["Psychiatry investigation", "Psychiatry Investig"]}
