The impact of the mTOR inhibitor everolimus on the mood of breast cancer patients is unknown. Materials and methods Consecutive, post-menopausal metastatic breast cancer patients receiving hormone therapy +/- everolimus were prospectively followed-up using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the MADRS (Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale) questionnaires. Results Post hoc tests comparing everolimus\u2009+\u2009hormonotherapy to hormonotherapy alone demonstrated a significant effect of everolimus after 6\u00a0weeks of treatment on BDI scores (t(1,38)\u2009=\u2009-2.0716, p\u2009<\u20090.05), and after 3\u00a0weeks (t(1,38)\u2009=\u2009-3.9165, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and 6\u00a0weeks of treatment (t(1,38)\u2009=\u2009-2.0373, p\u2009<\u20090.05) on MADRS scores. Analysis within each treatment group showed that the effect of time since treatment initiation on BDI and MADRS scores was specifically observed in the everolimus\u2009+\u2009hormonotherapy group (F(2,34)\u2009=\u200911.875, p\u2009<\u20090.001 and F(2,34)\u2009=\u20097.820, p\u2009<\u20090.01 respectively), but not in the hormonotherapy alone group (F(2,34)\u2009=\u20091.671, p\u2009>\u20090.2 and F(2,34)\u2009=\u20090.830, p\u2009>\u20090.2 respectively). Conclusions The mTOR inhibitor everolimus induces significant mood alterations in breast cancer patients. The evaluation of psychiatric symptoms is not only mandatory in the context of phase 1, dose-finding studies of PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors, but is also clinically relevant in daily practice.", "doi": "10.1007/s10637-017-0554-9", "title": "Everolimus induced mood changes in breast cancer patients: a case-control study.", "journal": ["Investigational new drugs", "Invest New Drugs"]}
