Furthermore, hyperhomocysteinaemia has been directly attributed to a deficiency in vitamins B12, folate, and B6. Several studies have demonstrated decrease in progression of mild cognitive impairement to Alzheimer's Disease, and some have even shown an improvement in cognition after vitamin supplements with B12 and folate. Plausible mechanisms linking hyperhomocysteinaemia to Alzheimer's and cognitive impairement have been hypothesized and demonstrated in hyperhomocysteinemic mice models. However, some studies have not elucidated any benefit of vitamin supplements in subjects with cognitive impairment. Hence, multicentric clinical studies need to be conducted to substantiate the mechanisms of neuronal degeneration due to hyperhomocysteinaemia and to demonstrate the beneficial effect of folate, B6 and B12 supplements on cognition.", "doi": "10.1007/s12291-017-0646-5", "title": "Role of Homocysteine in Cognitive Impairement and Alzheimer's Disease.", "journal": ["Indian journal of clinical biochemistry : IJCB", "Indian J Clin Biochem"]}
