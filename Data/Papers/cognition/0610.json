This was revealed in the context of the typical pattern of decreased grey matter integrity in schizophrenia compared to healthy individuals, including: (1) large grey matter volume reductions in the orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortices and the left fusiform/inferior temporal gyri; (2) decreased cortical thickness in the left inferior temporal and fusiform gyri, the left orbitofrontal gyrus, as well as in the right pars opercularis/precentral gyrus; and (3) decreased covariation of grey matter concentration in frontal and limbic brain regions emerging from the SBM analyses.Contrary to some - but not all - previous findings, this study of a large sample of schizophrenia cases and healthy controls reveals no evidence for association between grey matter alterations and variation in rs1344706 (ZNF804A). Differences in sample sizes and ethnicities may account for discrepant findings between the present and previous studies.", "doi": "10.1016/j.pnpbp.2017.12.007", "title": "Common variation in ZNF804A (rs1344706) is not associated with brain morphometry in schizophrenia or healthy participants.", "journal": ["Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry", "Prog.
