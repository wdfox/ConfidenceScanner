Cerebral A\u03b2 deposition was assessed by Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB)-PET in multiple regions of interest (ROIs) (i.e., frontal, orbitofrontal, parietal, temporal, anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate/precuneus, and motor). Cortical thickness was assessed on 3T MRI in corresponding ROIs. Gait parameters (gait speed, cadence, stride length, double support time, and covariance of stance time) were measured with GAITRite\u00ae. Multivariate-adjusted two level structural equation models were used to examine the longitudinal association between PiB-PET, cortical thickness, and change in gait over a median 15.6 months.Higher PiB-PET in all ROIs was associated with decreasing cadence and increasing double support time, and in the temporal ROI was associated with declining gait speed. In sex-stratified analyses, higher PiB-PET in all ROIs was associated with declining performance on all gait parameters among women. In contrast, among men, the only association was with higher orbitofrontal ROI PiB-PET and declining cadence. None of the associations were mediated by cortical thickness or attenuated after adjustment of baseline cognition.Higher PiB-PET was associated with declining gait, particularly among women in this middle-aged CN cohort, independent of cortical thickness and baseline cognitive.
