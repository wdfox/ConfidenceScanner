Recipients of this award may not have held a doctoral degree for more than nine years. For purposes of this award, psychology has been divided into 10 areas: animal learning and behavior, comparative; developmental; health; cognition/human learning; psychopathology; behavioral and cognitive neuroscience; perception/motor performance; social; applied research; and individual differences. Five areas are considered each year, with areas rotated in two-year cycles. The areas considered in 2017 were behavioral and cognitive neuroscience; perception/motor performance; social; applied research; and individual differences. Each year, panels are selected for the areas under consideration, and these panels recommend nominees to the Committee on Scientific Awards. The 2017 recipients of the APA Scientific Contribution Awards were recognized by the 2016 Board of Scientific Affairs and selected by the 2016 Committee on Scientific Awards. Members of the committee were James Grau, PhD (Chair); Megan R. Gunnar, PhD; Daniel N. Klein, PhD; Hazel R. Markus, PhD; Karen A. Matthews, PhD; and Linda Smith, PhD.
