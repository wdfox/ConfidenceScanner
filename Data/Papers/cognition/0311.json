This study examines the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a home-based computerized cognitive training (CCT) program to treat cancer-related cognitive impairment.Sixty men who had received \u2265\u20093\u00a0months of ADT were screened for at least mild cognitive or neurobehavioral impairment and randomized to 8\u00a0weeks of CCT or usual care. Follow-up assessments occurred immediately post-intervention or equivalent (T2) and 8\u00a0weeks later (T3). The acceptability of CCT was also assessed.Feasibility:A priori feasibility thresholds were partially met (i.e., randomization rate >\u200950%, retention rate >\u200970% excluding CCT drop-outs, but <\u200970% for intent-to-treat). Acceptability: Participants were mostly satisfied with CCT and found it somewhat enjoyable, though barriers to uptake existed. Preliminary efficacy: Linear mixed models indicated significant time by group effects favorable to CCT in reaction time (p\u2009=\u2009.01), but unfavorable to CCT in verbal and visual memory (ps\u00a0<\u00a0.05). Memory was temporarily suppressed in the CCT group at T2, but normalized by T3. There was no effect of CCT on self-reported cognitive functioning, neurobehavioral functioning, nor quality of life.This study provides tentative support for the feasibility and acceptability of CCT to treat mild cognitive impairment in ADT patients. CCT had a beneficial effect on reaction time, but temporarily suppressed memory. CCT's benefits may be limited to a narrow area of functioning. Larger-scale studies are needed.", "doi": "10.1007/s00520-017-4026-8", "title": "Computerized cognitive training in prostate cancer patients on androgen deprivation therapy: a pilot study.", "journal": ["Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer", "Support Care Cancer"]}
