We review recent research showing that these processes elicit personal or collective attitudes and action tendencies that may either contribute to alleviate the source of the threat (e.g., collective action toward equality) or to be merely palliative (e.g., displaced intergroup conflict, ethnic prejudice). Further research should focus more on testing the motivational processes underlying the effects of economic threat.", "doi": "10.1016/j.copsyc.2017.07.027", "title": "The consequences of economic threat for motivated social cognition and action.", "journal": ["Current opinion in psychology", "Curr Opin Psychol"]}
