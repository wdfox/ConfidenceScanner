We examined white matter signal abnormalities (WMSAs) and their association with RHIs and clinical function in former National Football League (NFL) players.Eighty-six clinically symptomatic former NFL players and 23 same-age reportedly asymptomatic controls without head trauma exposure underwent magnetic resonance imaging and neuropsychological testing. FreeSurfer calculated WMSAs. A cumulative head impact index quantified RHIs.In former NFL players, increased volume of WMSAs was associated with higher cumulative head impact index scores (P\u00a0=\u00a0.043) and worse psychomotor speed and executive function (P\u00a0=\u00a0.015). Although former NFL players had greater WMSA volume than controls (P\u00a0=\u00a0.046), these findings are inconclusive due to recruitment of controls based on lack of clinical symptoms and head trauma exposure.In former NFL players, WMSAs may reflect long-term microvascular and nonmicrovascular pathologies from RHIs that negatively impact cognition.", "doi": "10.1016/j.dadm.2017.10.003", "title": "White matter signal abnormalities in former National Football League players.", "journal": ["Alzheimer's & dementia (Amsterdam, Netherlands)", "Alzheimers Dement (Amst)"]}
