A multicentre, prospective, randomised, single-blind trial was conducted to assess the effect of losartan 50\u2009mg every other day (EOD), once a morning (OM) among post-dialysis euvolemic hypertensive patients. Post-dialysis euvolemic assessment was done by a body composition monitor (BCM). Covariate Adaptive Randomization was used for allocation of participants to the standard or intervention arm. Of the total 229 patients, 96 (41.9%) were identified as post-dialysis euvolemic hypertensive. Final samples of 88 (40.1%) patients were randomized into standard and intervention arms. After follow-up of 12 months' pre-dialysis systolic (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and diastolic (p 0.01), intradialysis diastolic (p 0.02), post-dialysis systolic (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and diastolic (p\u2009<\u20090.001) blood pressure was reduced from the baseline among intervention-arm patients Compared to only pre-dialysis systolic blood pressure (p 0.003) among standard arm patients after 12 months of follow. Total of six deaths were reported among standard-arm patients compared to 2 deaths among the intervention arm.
