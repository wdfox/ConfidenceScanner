Post-stratification survey weights were applied to obtain prevalence levels. Adjusted odds ratios for each variable related to the conditions were calculated using logistic regression models.Overall, the prevalence of hypertension was 18.0%, diabetes 9.2% and hypercholesterolaemia 4.0%. Among hypertensive individuals, the awareness rate was 48.5%; 15.8% were on treatment and 9.1% had their blood pressure controlled. Only 10.8% were aware they had diabetes, 4.5% were on treatment and 2.7% were controlled. The awareness level for hypercholesterolaemia was 4.2%, with 1.4% individuals on treatment and 1.4% controlled.The prevalence levels of hypertension and diabetes, which were higher than previous findings for the region, together with the observed low rates of awareness, treatment and control of all conditions studied, constitute an additional challenge to the regional health structures, which must rapidly adapt to the epidemiological shift occurring in this population.", "id": "29293258", "date": "2017-12-14", "title": "Prevalence, awareness, treatment and control of hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolaemia among adults in Dande municipality, Angola.", "doi": "10.5830/CVJA-2017-047", "journal": ["Cardiovascular journal of Africa", "Cardiovasc J Afr"]}
