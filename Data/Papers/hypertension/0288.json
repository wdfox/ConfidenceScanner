The degree of PAC decline after CCT was calculated.This study included 115 PA and 49 EH subjects. The prevalence of hypokalemia was 74.8% in the PA group. Supine PACs in the EH and PA groups were 15.1\u00b14.7 and 30.4\u00b112.1 mmol/L. Post-SIT PACs were 8.8\u00b11.7 ng/dL and 22.7\u00b110.2 ng/dL in the EH and PA groups. The degree of PAC decline after CCT was 17.7% and 14.2% in the EH and PA groups; post-CCT PACs were 11.7\u00b13.3 ng/dL and 25.9\u00b110.6 ng/dL. PAC values of 11.2 ng/dL and 16.7 ng/dL after the SIT and CCT represented the optimal cutoff values for PA diagnosis. The post-SIT and post-CCT AUCROC values were 0.972 (95% Cis=0.934-0.991) and 0.933 (95% Cis=0.883-0.966).Post-SIT and post-CCT PACs, but not the degree of PAC suppression, were both reliable for PA diagnosis. However, the optimal cutoffs were slightly higher in Chinese subjects than those recommended by the Endocrine Society.", "id": "29300995", "date": "2017-12-28", "title": "Evaluation of the Saline Infusion Test and the Captopril Challenge Test in Chinese Patients with Primary Aldosteronism.", "doi": "10.1210/jc.2017-01530", "journal": ["The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism", "J.
