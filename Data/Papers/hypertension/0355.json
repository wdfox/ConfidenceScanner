We present a case of a young woman with a history of hypertension in whom a pelvic and dysmorphic left kidney was discovered during ultrasound examination performed for the study of the renal arteries. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography imaging revealed a duplex pelvic kidney. This combination is very rare; we have not found a similar case reported in the literature.", "id": "29290905", "date": "2017-12-31", "title": "Duplex collecting system in a pelvic kidney - an unusual combination.", "doi": "10.3941/jrcr.v11i12.2991", "journal": ["Journal of radiology case reports", "J Radiol Case Rep"]}
