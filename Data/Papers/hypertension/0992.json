We performed a cardiometabolic assessment of cALL survivors from the PETALE cohort (n\u2009=\u2009247, median age at visit of 21.7 years). In our group, overweight and obesity affected over 70% of women. Pre-hypertension and hypertension were mostly common in men, both adults (20%) and children (19%). Prediabetes was mainly present in women (6.1% of female adult survivors) and 41.3% had dyslipidemia. Cranial radiation therapy was a predictor of dyslipidemia (RR: 1.60, 95% CI: 1.07-2.41) and high LDL-cholesterol (RR: 4.78, 95% CI: 1.72-13.28). Male gender was a predictor for pre-hypertension and hypertension (RR: 5.12, 95% CI: 1.81-14.46). Obesity at the end of treatment was a predictor of obesity at interview (RR: 2.07, 95% CI: 1.37-3.14) and of metabolic syndrome (RR: 3.04, 95% CI: 1.14-8.09). Compared to the general population, cALL survivors were at higher risk of having the metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, pre-hypertension/hypertension and high LDL-cholesterol, while the risk for obesity was not different. Our results support the need for early screening and lifestyle intervention in this population.", "id": "29247169", "date": "2017-12-15", "title": "Cardiometabolic Risk Factors in Childhood, Adolescent and Young Adult Survivors of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia - A Petale Cohort.", "doi": "10.1038/s41598-017-17716-0", "journal": ["Scientific reports", "Sci Rep"]}
