No urine EETs were detected; hence, enzyme linked innumosorbent assay 14,15-DHETs (dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids) were considered the total converted 14,15-urine pool. We report ultra-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry plasma EETs, DHETs, and their sum (plasma total pool) for the 3 regioisomers (8,9-, 11,12-, 14,15-) and their sum (08,15-). In salt-resistant subjects, urine total pool was unchanged by HiNa, decreased by LoNa, and correlated with urine sodium excretion, fractional excretion of Na+, and Na+/K+ ratio for the 3 days of the experiment combined (P<0.03). In contrast, plasma total pool increased in LoNa and did not correlate with natriuresis or Na+/K+ ratio but showed correlations between EETs, blood pressures, and catecholamines and between DHETs and aldosterone (P<0.03). Urine total pool of salt-sensitive was lower than that of salt-resistant subjects in certain phases of the experiment, lacked responses to changes in salt balance, and exhibited limited correlations with natriuresis and Na+/K+ ratio during LoNa only. Plasma total pool of salt-sensitive was lower than in salt-resistant subjects and did not correlate with blood pressures or aldosterone but did with catecholamines. We conclude that the urine total pool reflects a renal pool involved in regulation of natriuresis, whereas the plasma total pools are of systemic origin, uninvolved in Na+ excretion, perhaps contributing to regulation of vascular tone. Data suggest that abnormalities in EETs in salt-sensitive subjects participate in their renal or vascular dysfunction, which has potential therapeutic implications.", "id": "29279315", "date": "2017-12-26", "title": "Two Pools of Epoxyeicosatrienoic Acids in Humans: Alterations in Salt-Sensitive Normotensive Subjects.", "doi": "10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.117.10392", "journal": ["Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)", "Hypertension"]}
