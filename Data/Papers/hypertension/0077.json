In addition, we examined the correlations of these two parameters.The study participants were 40 middle-aged female volunteers, who were classified into obesity group (n = 20) and normal weight group (n = 20). Statistical analysis was performed using independent t-test and the Pearson correlation coefficient was used to correlate blood pressure and arterial stiffness.This study evaluated the systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and pulse wave velocity (PWV). These results were higher in the obesity group than the normal weight group. Furthermore, blood pressure and arterial stiffness (PWV, augmentation pressure) were static correlated.Obesity is closely related to blood pressure and arterial stiffness. Therefore, indices for blood pressure and arterial stiffness may play a vital role in predicting and preventing obesity and its sequelae.", "id": "29354393", "date": "2017-12-31", "title": "Effect of Obesity on Blood Pressure and Arterial Stiffness in Middle-Aged Korean Women.", "doi": "10.24171/j.phrp.2017.8.6.02", "journal": ["Osong public health and research perspectives", "Osong Public Health Res Perspect"]}
