Although debated in western countries, its utility in early diagnosis of kidney disorders has been proved by studies from Asia. We examined the prevalence of asymptomatic urinary abnormalities (AUA), obesity, and hypertension in school children and analyzed data to identify potential risk factors among those detected with such abnormalities.Children and adolescents 8 to 18 years of age of either gender, attending 14 public schools in West Bengal, were screened prospectively from July 2013 to July 2016 for detecting asymptomatic urinary abnormalities by a spot urine test using a dipstick. Sociodemographic profile, medical examination (weight, height, and blood pressure), and questionnaire-based data were recorded.A total of 11,000 children were screened. Of these, data from 9306 children were available for\u00a0AUA, obesity, and hypertension. The prevalence rate was 7.44% (95% confidence interval [CI]\u00a0= 6.91%-7.97%) for at least 1 AUA. Isolated hematuria was present in 5.2% (95% CI 4.75%-5.65%), whereas isolated proteinuria was present in 1.9% (95% CI\u00a0= 1.62%-2.18%). The prevalence of prehypertension was 13.43% (95% CI\u00a0= 12.74%-14.12%) and that of hypertension and abnormal body mass index was 4.05% (95% CI\u00a0= 6.43%-7.47%) and 38.67 (95% CI\u00a0= 37.68%-39.66%) respectively.The prevalence rates of AUA were comparable with those in some Asian countries but higher than in most developed countries. Of children and adolescents 8 to 18 years of age, those 13 to 18 years had significantly more high risk factors such as AUA, hypertension, and obesity.", "id": "29270525", "date": "2017-08-08", "title": "A Cross-sectional Prospective Study of Asymptomatic Urinary Abnormalities, Blood Pressure, and Body Mass Index in Healthy School Children.", "doi": "10.1016/j.ekir.2017.07.018", "journal": ["Kidney international reports", "Kidney Int Rep"]}
