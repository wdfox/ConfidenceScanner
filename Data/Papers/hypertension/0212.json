A more controversial and less understood association is that of sleep apneas and the development and worsening of autoimmune and rheumatologic disorders. Through the main pathways of intermittent hypoxia and sleep deprivation, we hypothesize that obstructive sleep apnea creates a chronic inflammatory state that worsens or incites autoimmune disorders. This thorough review of the available literature highlights our current understanding of the relationship between these disease processes in order to demonstrate the importance of diagnosis and appropriate management of sleep disorders in patients suffering from rheumatologic diseases.", "id": "29317057", "date": "2017-12-05", "title": "The complex associations between obstructive sleep apnea and auto-immune disorders: A review.", "doi": "10.1016/j.mehy.2017.12.004", "journal": ["Medical hypotheses", "Med.
