The HbA1c levels were not altered in all of the patients including those on hemodialysis (n\u2009=\u200920). The active glucagon-like peptide-1 levels or other renal parameters were not altered significantly. There were no adverse events to be related to the drugs. The daily drug expense was reduced by 88.1\u00a0yen per patient.Switching to a small dose of sitagliptin according to the renal function in T2DM patients with renal dysfunction demonstrated the same efficacy and safety as those with other full-dose DPP-4 inhibitors, indicating a therapeutic option with a high cost performance.", "id": "29275488", "date": "2017-12-23", "title": "The renoprotective effect and safety of a DPP-4 inhibitor, sitagliptin, at a small dose in type 2 diabetic patients with a renal dysfunction when changed from other DPP-4 inhibitors: REAL trial.", "doi": "10.1007/s10157-017-1521-7", "journal": ["Clinical and experimental nephrology", "Clin.
