The aims of this study were to evaluate the outcomes of ESD in treating EGC in patients with LC.The multicenter retrospective study identified 43 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB)-related cirrhosis undergoing ESD for treating EGC. The patients (LC group) were subdivided into two groups based on their Child-Pugh classification (CP-class): 32 with CP-class A (LC-A) and 11 with CP-class B (LC-B). The patients were compared to 47 non-cirrhotic CHB patients who underwent ESD (CHB group). Eight patients had a past history of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) prior to ESD, but no patients had viable HCC when ESD was performed.Procedural outcomes (en bloc, lateral/basal margins resection) and post-procedural complications (bleeding or perforation) did not differ significantly between the LC and CHB groups or between the LC-A and LC-B groups. No patients experienced worsening of the Child-Pugh score 1\u00a0month after ESD compared with the baseline score. During a median observation period of 66\u00a0months, the recurrence rates of gastric cancers were similar between the LC and CHB groups (5-year recurrence rates: 2.4 vs. 2.3%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.925), and all recurrent gastric cancers were completely resected by additional ESD. The overall mortality rate was increased in the LC group (5-year mortality rates: 17.9 vs. 5.7%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.034), and 8 of 10 deaths were attributed to liver-related diseases (such as HCC, complications of portal hypertension, hepatic failure).ESD is feasible in patients with EGC and comorbid LC, even those with CP-class B cirrhosis. Their prognosis depends on LC-related diseases and not recurrent EGC.", "id": "29282635", "date": "2017-12-27", "title": "Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection of Early Gastric Cancer in Patients with Liver Cirrhosis.", "doi": "10.1007/s10620-017-4814-5", "journal": ["Digestive diseases and sciences", "Dig.
