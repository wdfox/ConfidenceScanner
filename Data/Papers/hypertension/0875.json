Although direct-acting antivirals (DAA) represent revolutionary treatment of hepatitis C, there are currently no studies showing histological effects of therapy on a large number of cirrhotic patients. However, studies involving transient elastography demonstrated a rapid decrease in liver stiffness after successful DAA therapy, probably due to resolution of inflammation, rather than fibrosis regression, as the latter requires a longer period of time. Reversal of fibrosis and cirrhosis upon viral eradication is a prerequisite for the reduction of portal pressure, but this effect has only been observed for the subclinical stage of portal hypertension (PH). On the other hand, the majority of patients with clinically significant PH remain at risk of decompensation and death, despite hepatitis C virus cure, as PH remains high in this setting. This calls for novel therapeutic approaches.", "id": "29255805", "date": "2017-11-16", "title": "Hepatitis C is now curable, but what happens with cirrhosis and portal hypertension afterwards?", "doi": "10.5114/ceh.2017.71491", "journal": ["Clinical and experimental hepatology", "Clin Exp Hepatol"]}
