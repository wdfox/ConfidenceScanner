However, if no bleeding point can be detected by endoscopy in the predilection sites of gastrointestinal varices, such as the esophagus and stomach, ectopic gastrointestinal variceal bleeding should be considered as a differential diagnosis. Herein, we report a case of ectopic ileal variceal bleeding in a 57-year-old woman, which was successfully diagnosed by multi-detector row CT (MDCT) and angiography and treated by segmental ileum resection. To date, there have been no consensus for the treatment of ectopic ileal variceal bleeding. This review was designed to clarify the clinical characteristics of patients with ectopic ileal variceal and discuss possible treatment strategies. From the PubMed database and our own database, we reviewed 21 consecutive cases of ileal variceal bleeding diagnosed from 1982 to 2017. MDCT and angiography is useful for the rapid examination and surgical resection of an affected lesion and is a safe and effective treatment strategy to avoid further bleeding.", "id": "29359035", "date": null, "title": "Ectopic gastrointestinal variceal bleeding with portal hypertension.", "doi": "10.4240/wjgs.v9.i12.288", "journal": ["World journal of gastrointestinal surgery", "World J Gastrointest Surg"]}
