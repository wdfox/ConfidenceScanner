Patients may refer to the clinic with complaints of bone pain, hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, growth retardation, interstitial pulmonary disease, pulmonary hypertension, and skeletal disorders. Skeletal system involvement is observed commonly in Gaucher patients and a significant cause of morbidity. Our patient was followed for several years as a glass child - osteogenesis imperfecta and he had joint deformities due to skeletal fractures. We wanted to present this case to raise awareness of GD's skeletal involvement and effects of late diagnosis.", "id": "29354164", "date": "2017-12-27", "title": "Actual reason for bone fractures in the case of a patient followed-up with the osteogenesis imperfecta: Gaucher's Disease.", "doi": "10.11138/ccmbm/2017.14.3.336", "journal": ["Clinical cases in mineral and bone metabolism : the official journal of the Italian Society of Osteoporosis, Mineral Metabolism, and Skeletal Diseases", "Clin Cases Miner Bone Metab"]}
