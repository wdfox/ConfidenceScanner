Lisinopril (14.5\u00b13.9 and 14.3\u00b14.7 mg/day) and, if indicated, atorvastatin (15.4\u00b13.8 mg/day, n=9 and 16.0\u00b14.8 mg/day, n=10), and acetylsalicylic acid (91.5\u00b114.7 mg/day, n=12 and 94.1\u00b116.5 mg/day, n=14) were administered as a part of combination therapy. Quantitative evaluation of RAS (cardiorespiratory synchronism test), EchoCG, triplex scanning of brachiocephalic arteries, treadmill test, 6-min walk test, 24-h BP and ECG monitoring, and subjective assessment of the quality of life were performed at baseline and after 6 months of therapy.Both regimens of the combination drug therapy comparably improved the structural and functional status of the heart, increased exercise tolerance, effectively suppressed SVT paroxysms, and improved the quality of life. In this process, sotalol reduced RAS to a lesser extent that bisoprolol.In patients with paroxysmal SVT associated with stage II-III EH, the sotalol treatment as a part of the combination therapy may be preferable due to fewer adverse effects on RAS compared to bisoprolol.", "id": "29276907", "date": null, "title": "[Regulatory adaptive status in determining the effectiveness of bisoprololum and sotalolum in patients with hypertensive disease and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia].", "doi": null, "journal": ["Kardiologiia", "Kardiologiia"]}
