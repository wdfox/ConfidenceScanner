The results have been viewed against present strategies of antihypertensive treatment in children. There is still limited data concerning the treatment of hypertension in dialyzed pediatric patients.The study embraced 10 of 12 pediatric dialysis units in Poland treating 59 pediatric patients (mean age - 132 months). Collected information included present antihypertensive treatment with regard to drug classes and the dose of antihypertensive agent. The treatment was regarded as effective if both systolic and diastolic values of blood pressure were below 1.64 SDS. The results from 2013 were juxtaposed with previously analyzed data from a similar study on hypertension in dialyzed children conducted in 2003/2004.Forty subjects have been provided with antihypertensive treatment. In monotherapy and polytherapy 50% of the subjects were treated with ACEI (enalapril and ramipril), 67.5% with amlodipine, 50% with beta-blockers. Only 10% of the subjects were treated with angiotensin II receptor blocker (losartan). Thirty percent of the subjects received furosemide, whereas 5% were given doxazosin. Antihypertensive drugs regarded as the 2nd and 3rd choice in treating high blood pressure (doxazosin, beta-blockers and furosemide) were applied as monotherapy in 46% of the patients. Satisfactory control of treated blood pressure was reached in 45% of them.Antihypertensive treatment in dialyzed children did not change significantly during the last decade with regard to the groups of drugs being used. Despite a wider feasibility of antihypertensive substances, the effectiveness of this therapy was still unsatisfactory.", "id": "29264885", "date": null, "title": "Antihypertensive treatment prescription in pediatric dialysis patients in Poland: A comparison between two nationwide studies 2003/2004-2013.", "doi": null, "journal": ["Advances in clinical and experimental medicine : official organ Wroclaw Medical University", "Adv Clin Exp Med"]}
