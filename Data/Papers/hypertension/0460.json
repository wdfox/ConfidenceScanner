Over the past ten years, there has been tremendous progress in our understanding of pulmonary endothelial biology as it pertains to the genetic and molecular mechanisms that orchestrate the endothelial response to direct or indirect injury, and how their dysregulation can contribute to the pathogenesis of PAH. As one of the major topics included in the 2017 Grover Conference Series, discussion centered on recent developments in four areas of pulmonary endothelial biology: (1) angiogenesis; (2) endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT); (3) epigenetics; and (4) biology of voltage-gated ion channels. The present review will summarize the content of these discussions and provide a perspective on the most promising aspects of endothelial dysfunction that may be amenable for therapeutic development.", "id": "29283043", "date": "2017-12-28", "title": "Endothelial dysfunction in pulmonary arterial hypertension: an evolving landscape (2017 Grover Conference Series).", "doi": "10.1177/2045893217752912", "journal": ["Pulmonary circulation", "Pulm Circ"]}
