Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), as a group of metabolites, exert positive regulatory effects on energy metabolism, hormone secretion, immune inflammation, hypertension, and cancer. The functions of SCFAs are related to their activation of transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors and their inhibition of histone acetylation. Though controversial, growing evidence suggests that SCFAs, which regulate inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis, have been involved in kidney disease through the activation of the gut-kidney axis; however, the molecular relationship among gut microbiota-derived metabolites, signaling pathways, and kidney disease remains to be elucidated. This review will provide an overview of the physiology and functions of SCFAs in kidney disease.", "id": "29270002", "date": "2017-12-11", "title": "Gut microbiota-derived short-chain fatty acids and kidney diseases.", "doi": "10.2147/DDDT.S150825", "journal": ["Drug design, development and therapy", "Drug Des Devel Ther"]}
