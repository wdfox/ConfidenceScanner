Thus, we assessed the relationship of frailty and disability with ambulatory BP in older adults.Cross-sectional study of 1047 community-living individuals aged \u226560\u00a0years in Spain.BP was determined with validated devices under standardized conditions during 24\u00a0hours. Frailty was defined as having 3 or more of the following criteria: weight loss, low grip strength, low energy, slow gait speed, and low physical activity. Disability was assessed with the Lawton-Brod\u00fds questionnaire on instrumental activities of daily living. Associations with systolic BP (SBP) and dipping (nocturnal SBP decline) were modeled and adjusted for sociodemographic variables, body mass index, lifestyles, antihypertensive drug treatment, comorbidities, 24-hour heart rate, and conventional or ambulatory SBP as appropriate.Participants' mean age was 71.7\u00a0years (50.8% men); 6% were frail and 8.1% had disability. Compared with nonfrail participants, those with frailty had 3.5\u00a0mm Hg lower daytime SBP (P\u00a0=\u00a0.001), 3.3% less SBP dipping (P\u00a0=\u00a0.003), and 3.6\u00a0mmHg higher nighttime SBP (P\u00a0=\u00a0.016). Compared with participants who are not disabled, those who are disabled had 2.5\u00a0mmHg lower daytime SBP (P\u00a0=\u00a0.002), 2.5% less SBP dipping (P\u00a0=\u00a0.003), and 2.7\u00a0mmHg higher nighttime SBP (P\u00a0=\u00a0.011).In community-dwelling older adults, frailty and disability were independently associated with lower diurnal SBP, blunted nocturnal decline of SBP, and higher nocturnal SBP. These findings may help explain the higher mortality associated with low clinic SBP in frail older subjects observed in epidemiologic studies.", "id": "29291959", "date": "2017-12-30", "title": "Frailty, Disability, and Ambulatory Blood Pressure in Older Adults.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jamda.2017.11.014", "journal": ["Journal of the American Medical Directors Association", "J Am Med Dir Assoc"]}
