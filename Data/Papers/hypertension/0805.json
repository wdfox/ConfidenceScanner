In this review, we describe recent advances in understanding the pathology, and discuss the long-term impacts on maternal vascular health. Next, we describe the genetic, epigenetic and immunological basis of preeclampsia. We describe the links between preeclampsia and oxidative stress in placental (trophoblast) and endothelial cells. We mention cellular and animal models commonly used to decipher modified pathophysiological pathways in a preeclamptic pregnancy compared to a normal pregnancy. Finally, we discuss the therapeutic options, readily available or in development, to improve the monitoring of pregnancies, the health of patients and that of children born from preeclamptic pregnancies.", "id": "29261496", "date": "2017-12-20", "title": "[New perspectives on preeclampsia].", "doi": "10.1051/medsci/20173312015", "journal": ["Medecine sciences : M/S", "Med Sci (Paris)"]}
