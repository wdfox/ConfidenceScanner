EchoCG, markers of immune inflammation and hormonal changes (endothelin, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), aldosterone, renin) were evaluated at baseline. The endpoint was development of acute fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events (CVEs). The one-way regression analysis was used to identify predictors of the risk for CVEs. The ROC analysis was used to determine \"threshold levels\" of significant predictors for this risk.During the 5\u2011year follow-up period, CVEs developed in 13 (39.4 %) patients. The CVE predictors included baseline increases in creatinine and IL-6, NT-proBNP and a greater decrease in EF (\u0440.", "id": "29276900", "date": null, "title": "[Heart failure with preserved and slightly impaired ejection fraction and cardiovascular events: Pathogenetic interrelations as a part of the cardiovascular continuum].", "doi": null, "journal": ["Kardiologiia", "Kardiologiia"]}
