Patients' medical files were reviewed by a panel of nephrologists in the subsequent days and at one and three-years follow-up.From May 1st to June 21st 2013, there were 8464 admissions in the ED, of which 653 had an eGFR <60\u00a0ml/mn/1.73\u00a0m2. Of these, 352 had previous CKI, 341 had CA-AKI, and 104 had CA-ACKI (community-acquired acute on chronic kidney injury). Occurrence of superimposed CA-AKI in CKI patients was associated with male gender and with use of diuretics, but not with use of ARBs or ACEIs. Adequate management of CA-AKI defined as identification, diagnostic procedures and therapeutic intervention within 24\u00a0h, was recorded in 45% of the cases and was not associated with improved outcomes. Three-year mortality was 21 and 48% in CKI and CA-ACKI patients respectively, and 40% in patients with only CA-AKI (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Mortality was significantly associated with age, hypertension, ischemic heart disease and CA-AKI. Progression of renal insufficiency was associated with male gender and age.CA-AKI is more frequently encountered in male patients and those treated with diuretics and is an independent risk factor for long-term mortality. Its initial adequate management failed to improve outcomes.", "id": "29287584", "date": "2017-12-29", "title": "Risk factors for community-acquired acute kidney injury in patients with and without chronic kidney injury and impact of its initial management on prognosis: a prospective observational study.", "doi": "10.1186/s12882-017-0792-2", "journal": ["BMC nephrology", "BMC Nephrol"]}
