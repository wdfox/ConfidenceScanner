This survey was designed to determine the interest of primary care patients in participating in program designed to maximize enjoyment. Primary care patients (n\u00a0=\u00a0540) in Central Pennsylvania reported their interest in participating in a \"a regular fitness program where people your own age played games, such as softball, floor hockey and soccer, that were made to be easier to play and less competitive.\" Mean age was 58.4\u00a0years (SD\u00a0=\u00a016.5, range\u00a0=\u00a018-98). More than one-third (37.0%), including 59.6% of those under age 50, were interested in the modified sports fitness program. After adjusting for confounders, patients under age 40 were 5.9 (95% CI: 2.6-13.9) times as interested (v. age\u00a0>\u00a070) and non-white patients were 3.4 (95% CI: 1.3-8.5) times interested. Female patients and those with hypertension, high cholesterol or obesity were equally interested. A fitness program that consists of modified sports may be of interest to most primary care patients under age 50. Patients' initial interest appears high enough to warrant further development and testing.", "id": "29255662", "date": "2017-12-01", "title": "Why just exercise if you can play?
