Spirometric pulmonary function tests were performed before and after four-hour hemodialysis sessions.The patients' average age was 45.8 \u00b1 10.0 years; 64% were males and 64% had normal body mass index. Anemia (94%) and hypoalbuminemia (72%) were common. Diabetes mellitus (68%), hypertension (34%) and coronary artery disease (18%) were major comorbidities. Forty-five patients (90%) had been on hemodialysis for six months to three years. The patients' pre-dialysis mean forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) were below normal: 45.8 \u00b1 24.9% and 43.5 \u00b1 25.9% of predicted, respectively. After hemodialysis, these increased significantly, to 51.1 \u00b1 23.4% and 49.3 \u00b1 25.5% of predicted, respectively (P < 0.01). The increase in mean FEV1/FVC, from 97.8 \u00b1 20.8% to 99.3 \u00b1 20.1% of predicted, was not significant (P > 0.05). The pre-dialysis mean forced expiratory flow 25-75% was 50.1 \u00b1 31% and increased significantly, to 56.3 \u00b1 31.6% of predicted (P < 0.05). The mean peak expiratory flow was below normal (43.8 \u00b1 30.7%) and increased significantly, to 49.1 \u00b1 29.9% of predicted (P < 0.05). Males and females showed similar directions of change after hemodialysis.Pulmonary function abnormalities are common among ESRD patients. Comparison of pre and post-hemodialysis parameters showed significant improvements, but normal predicted values were still not achieved.", "id": "29267516", "date": null, "title": "A study of pulmonary function in end-stage renal disease patients on hemodialysis: a cross-sectional study.", "doi": "10.1590/1516-3180.2017.0179150817", "journal": ["Sao Paulo medical journal = Revista paulista de medicina", "Sao Paulo Med J"]}
