We aimed to analyze the association magnitudes between TT and multiple metabolic parameters in general Chinese men.4309 men were recruited from SPECT-China study in 2014-2015, which was performed in 22 sites in East China. TT, weight status, and various metabolic parameters were measured. Linear and logistic regressions were used to analyze the associations.Men in lower TT quartiles had worse metabolic parameters including body mass index, triglycerides, HbA1c, and HOMA-IR (all P for trend < 0.001). Body mass index (B -0.32, 95%CI -0.35 to -0.29) and obesity (OR 0.40, 95%CI 0.35-0.45) had the largest association magnitude per one SD increment in TT, while blood pressure and hypertension (OR 0.90, 95%CI 0.84-0.98) had the smallest. These associations also persisted in individuals without metabolic syndrome.Obesity indices had closer relationships with TT than most other metabolic measures with blood pressure the least close. These associations remained robust after adjustment for adiposity and in subjects without metabolic syndrome.", "id": "29333158", "date": "2017-12-03", "title": "Testosterone: Relationships with Metabolic Disorders in Men-An Observational Study from SPECT-China.", "doi": "10.1155/2017/4547658", "journal": ["International journal of endocrinology", "Int J Endocrinol"]}
