In this prospective study we aimed to identify currently unknown correlations valuable to cardiovascular research and patient management.Blood samples from 500 patients were collected directly before cardiosurgical interventions (Ethics Committee reference number 85/11). Four central redox parameters were determined together with about 30 clinical, anthropometric, and metabolic parameters.Creatinine levels and pulmonary hypertension were significant predictors of the total antioxidant status (TAOS) in the patients; total glutathione levels were linked to C-peptide, and creatinine, gender, and ventricular arrhythmia influenced nitrate/nitrite levels. Notably, significant interactions were found between medication and redox parameters. Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) were positive predictors of total glutathione levels, whereas angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and CCBs were negative predictors of NOx levels. Age showed the highest correlation with the duration of the intensive care stay, followed by NOx levels, creatinine, TAOS, and C-reactive protein.In this prospective study we determined multiple correlations between redox markers and parameters linked to cardiovascular diseases. The data point towards so far unknown interdependencies, particularly between antihypertensive drugs and redox metabolism. A thorough follow-up to these data has the potential to improve patient management.A: absorption; \u0394A: absorption difference; ABTS: 2,2'-azino-di(3-ethylbenzothiazoline sulfonate); ACE: angiotensin-converting enzyme; AO: antioxidant; ARB: angiotensin receptor blocker; BMI: body mass index; CAD: coronary artery disease; CCB: calcium channel blocker; CDC: coronary heart diseases; COPD: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; CRP: C-reactive protein; CVD: cardiovascular diseases; Cu-OOH: cumene hydroperoxide; D: dilution factor; DAN: 2,3-diaminonaphtalene; DMSO: dimethylsulfoxide; DNA: deoxyribonucleic acid; DTNB: 5,5-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate); \u03b5: extinction coefficient; EDRF: endothelium-derived relaxing factor; fc: final concentration; GPx: glutathione peroxidases; (h)GR: (human) glutathione reductase; GSH: (reduced) glutathione; GSSG: glutathione disulfide; GST: glutathione-S-transferase; Hb: hemoglobin; HDL: high-density lipoprotein; Hk: hematocrit; H2O2: hydrogen peroxide; ICS: intensive care stay; LDH: lactate dehydrogenase; LDL: low-density lipoprotein; MI: myocardial infarction; NED: N-(1-naphthyl)-ethylendiamine-dihydrochloride; NOS: nitric oxide synthase; NOx: nitrate/nitrite; NR: nitrate reductase; PBS: phosphate buffered saline; PCA: principle component analysis; PH: pulmonary hypertension; ROS: reactive oxygen species; RNS: reactive nitrogen species; RT: room temperature (25\u00b0C); SA: sulfanilamide; SOD: superoxide dismutase; SSA: sulfosalicylic acid; TAC: total antioxidant capacity; TAOS: total antioxidant status; TEAC: trolox equivalent antioxidative capacity; TG: triglycerides; tGSH: total glutathione; TNB-: 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoate; U: unit; UV: ultraviolet; VA: volume activity; Wc: working concentration; WHR: waist-hip ratio.", "id": "29257712", "date": "2017-12-19", "title": "Redox status of patients before cardiac surgery.", "doi": "10.1080/13510002.2017.1418620", "journal": ["Redox report : communications in free radical research", "Redox Rep."]}
