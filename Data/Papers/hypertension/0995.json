Incident cases had to fulfill at least 1 of 3 criteria: the American Rheumatism Association 1977 preliminary criteria for gout, the Rome criteria, or the New York criteria.A total of 158 patients with new-onset gout were identified during 1989-1992 and 271 patients during 2009-2010, yielding age- and sex-adjusted incidence rates of 66.6/100,000 (95% CI 55.9-77.4) in 1989-1992 and 136.7/100,000 (95% CI 120.4-153.1) in 2009-2010. The incidence rate ratio was 2.62 (95% CI 1.80-3.83). At the time of their first gout flare, patients diagnosed with gout in 2009-2010 had higher prevalence of comorbid conditions compared with 1989-1992, including hypertension (69% vs 54%), diabetes mellitus (25% vs 6%), renal disease (28% vs 11%), hyperlipidemia (61% vs 21%), and morbid obesity (body mass index \u2265 35 kg/m2; 29% vs 10%).The incidence of gout has more than doubled over the recent 20 years. This increase together with the more frequent occurrence of comorbid conditions and cardiovascular risk factors represents a significant public health challenge.", "id": "29247151", "date": "2017-12-15", "title": "The Rising Incidence of Gout and the Increasing Burden of Comorbidities: A Population-based Study over 20 Years.", "doi": "10.3899/jrheum.170806", "journal": ["The Journal of rheumatology", "J.
