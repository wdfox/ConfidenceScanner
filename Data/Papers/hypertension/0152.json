Possible undiagnosed OSA was estimated using self-reported frequent loud snoring and witness apneas. International Criteria for Sleep Disorders-3 criteria identified insomnia symptoms. Logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, obesity, and smoking determined correlates of sleep disorders.Comorbid sleep conditions were common, with 56% of participants demonstrating \u22651 condition. Reporting \u22651 mental health condition (depression and/or anxiety) was independently associated with diagnosed OSA (odds ratio [95% confidence interval {CI}]: 6.6 [3.2-13.6]), undiagnosed OSA (3.2 [1.8-5.8]), simple snoring (2.4 [1.2-4.5]), insomnia symptoms (4.3 [2.5-7.3]), and restless legs (1.9 [1.2-3.1]). Diagnosed OSA was significantly associated with \u22651 cardiometabolic condition (2.9 [1.4-6.0]) and arthritis (3.6 [1.8-7.2]). ESS \u226511 was associated with diagnosed (3.1 [1.4-6.8]) and undiagnosed OSA (6.2 [3.4-11.4]), insomnia symptoms (2.6 [1.4-4.9]), and restless legs (2.3 [1.4-4.0]), and these sleep conditions were also significantly associated with \u22652 diagnosed medical problems.Strategies to facilitate the diagnosis and management of often comorbid sleep disorders in primary care are required to reduce the significant sleep-related disparities in cardiometabolic and mental health.", "id": "29332673", "date": "2017-12-06", "title": "Prevalence and comorbidity of sleep conditions in Australian adults: 2016 Sleep Health Foundation national survey.", "doi": "10.1016/j.sleh.2017.10.006", "journal": ["Sleep health", "Sleep Health"]}
