There were no other neurological abnormalities. Cranial diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a localized infarction in the right-sided suprathalamic white matter. Under antiplatelet agent and rehabilitation, the patient became asymptomatic within 4\u00a0days. This is a first reported case of isolated astasia due to a suprathalamic white matter infarction. We speculated that disruption of the connection from the ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus to the posterior cingulate gyrus and/or supplementary motor area might cause astasia.", "id": "29264041", "date": "2017-04-13", "title": "Isolated astasia caused by a localized infarction in the suprathalamic white matter.", "doi": "10.1002/jgf2.54", "journal": ["Journal of general and family medicine", "J Gen Fam Med"]}
