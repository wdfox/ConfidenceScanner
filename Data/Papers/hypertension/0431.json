Because patients on veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA ECMO) are therapeutically anticoagulated, intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator is contraindicated. For AIS management, these patients must undergo emergent intra-arterial therapy. Presented is a patient on VA ECMO who subsequently suffered a large vessel embolic stroke requiring emergent surgical intervention. The decision by our anesthetic team to perform the procedure under monitored anesthesia care is discussed.", "id": "29284886", "date": null, "title": "Monitored Anesthesia Care for the Acute Ischemic Stroke Patient with End-stage Pulmonary Disease.", "doi": "10.4103/aer.AER_95_17", "journal": ["Anesthesia, essays and researches", "Anesth Essays Res"]}
