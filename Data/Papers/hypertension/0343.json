Few reports exist regarding a colectomy performed in patients with PH. Herein, we report two cases of colectomy performed in patients with severe PH, accompanied with marked edema of the colonic stoma after surgery.In case 1, a 54-year-old patient with sigmoid cancer and severe primary PH underwent Hartmann's operation. After the operation, his stoma became markedly edematous and ulcerated. Swelling of the stoma became gradually reduced, and the patient was discharged from hospital 36 days after the operation. In case 2, a 62-year-old patient with upper rectal cancer and severe PH also underwent Hartmann's operation; his stoma became markedly edematous without ulceration.Marked edema of the colonic stoma was observed in two cases with severe PH, with ulceration of the mucosa observed in one case. It was considered reasonable to avoid anastomosis in cases with severe PH.", "id": "29292181", "date": "2017-12-29", "title": "Marked edema of colonic stoma after colectomy and severe pulmonary hypertension: Report of two cases.", "doi": "10.1016/j.clinre.2017.04.003", "journal": ["Clinics and research in hepatology and gastroenterology", "Clin Res Hepatol Gastroenterol"]}
