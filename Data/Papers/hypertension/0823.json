These patients were previously diagnosed as having glaucoma, ocular hypertension, or had responded previously with sustained elevated intraocular pressure. Of 1661 procedures were performed. Totally 219 (13%) of the injections were on phakic patients. A median (SD) of 210 \u00b5L (40 \u00b5L) of aqueous was removed during each paracentesis. There were no reported incidences of any complications.
