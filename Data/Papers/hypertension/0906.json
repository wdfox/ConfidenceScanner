In a derivation cohort (n\u00a0=\u00a0114), we determined cutpoints for a four-tier severity grading system that would maximize sensitivity and specificity, and validated it in a separate cohort (n\u00a0=\u00a0114). Cutpoints for mPA were defined with \u226427\u00a0mm(F) and \u226429\u00a0mm(M) as the normal reference range; mild as >27 to <31\u00a0mm(F) and >29 to <31\u00a0mm(M); moderate\u226531-34\u00a0mm; and severe>34\u00a0mm. Cutpoints for ratio PA were defined as normal \u22640.9; mild>0.9 to 1.0; moderate>1.0 to 1.1; and severe>1.1.Sensitivities for normal tier were 99% for mPA and 93% for ratio PA; while specificities for severe tier were 98% for mPA>34\u00a0mm and 100% for ratio PA>1.1. C-statistics for four-tier mPA and ratio PA were both 0.90 (derivation) and both 0.85 (validation). Severity of mPA and ratio PA corresponded to hemodynamics by RHC and echocardiography (both p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Moderate-severe mPA values of \u226531\u00a0mm and ratio PA>1.1 had worse survival than normal values (all p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.01).A CT-based four-tier severity classification system of PA diameter and its ratio to the aortic diameter has high accuracy for PH diagnosis with increased mortality in patients with moderate-severe severity grades. These results may support clinical utilization on chest and cardiac CT reports.", "id": "29254655", "date": "2017-12-06", "title": "A four-tier classification system of pulmonary artery metrics on computed tomography for the diagnosis and prognosis of pulmonary hypertension.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jcct.2017.12.001", "journal": ["Journal of cardiovascular computed tomography", "J Cardiovasc Comput Tomogr"]}
