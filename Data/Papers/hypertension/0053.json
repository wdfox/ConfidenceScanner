She also had erythematous, violaceous, infiltrated plaques with microvesiculation on the bilateral thighs of several months' duration. She reported pruritus, burning, and discomfort. Her medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and asthma with no history of skin rashes. Workup revealed lichen planus pemphigoides (LPP), a rare papulosquamous and vesiculobullous dermatosis that shares features of both lichen planus (LP) and bullous pemphigoid (BP). Despite multiple traditional therapies, her disease continued to progress, further developing mucosal disease. After a review of the literature on LP, BP, and LPP, it was noted that tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), along with other cytokines, plays a pivotal role in all 3 diseases. After several conventional systemic therapies failed, we treated our patient with ustekinumab with favorable results.", "id": "29360890", "date": null, "title": "Lichen planus pemphigoides treated with ustekinumab.", "doi": null, "journal": ["Cutis", "Cutis"]}
