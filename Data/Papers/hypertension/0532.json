Here, we present a case of CMV esophagitis with antigenemia, that developed within 3\u00a0days of kidney transplantation, a timeline generally considered to be too early for development of a CMV infection. Intense immunosuppressive therapy for desensitization in ABO-incompatibility or in the presence of donor-specific antibody can increase the risk for significant opportunistic infection immediately after or even before transplantation.", "id": "29277957", "date": "2017-12-26", "title": "Early post-transplant diagnosis of cytomegalovirus esophagitis in an ABO-incompatible kidney transplant recipients: A case report.", "doi": "10.1111/tid.12827", "journal": ["Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society", "Transpl Infect Dis"]}
