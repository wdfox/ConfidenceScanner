Recently, UA has been linked to LV hypertrophy (LVH) and diastolic dysfunction (DD) in women with preserved ejection fraction (pEF) but not in corresponding men. We sought to assess if UA could predict indices of DD in hypertensive subjects with pEF independently of gender.We consecutively recruited 382 apparently healthy hypertensive subjects (age: 61.7\u00b110.7, women: 61.3%, median EF: 64%). In 318 patients in sinus rhythm, LV mass-indexed to body surface area-was calculated (LVMI). LVH was set as an LVMI >116g/m2 or 96 g/m2 in men and women, respectively. The ratio of early transmitral peak velocity (E) to the mitral annular early diastolic velocity (Em) was used as an approximation of mean left atrial pressure (E/Em).UA [median (interquartile range): 5.4(2) mg/dl] independently predicted E/Em (adjusted coefficient: 1.01, p =0.026) while an interaction term between gender and UA was no significant (p=0.684). An ordinal score of DD was calculated taking into account increased E/Em, left atrium dilatation and LVH. Women with increased UA had 254% increased odds (adjusted OR=2.54, p=0.005) to be classified in the upper range of the DD score.In hypertensive subjects without HF, UA is independently associated with the presence of DD in both genders and correlates with its severity in women. Further prospective studies are warranted to evaluate the association of UA with adverse cardiovascular outcomes in high-risk populations such as HF with pEF.", "id": "29278214", "date": "2017-12-26", "title": "Serum uric acid is independently associated with diastolic dysfunction in apparently healthy subjects with essential hypertension.", "doi": "10.2174/1570161116666171226124959", "journal": ["Current vascular pharmacology", "Curr Vasc Pharmacol"]}
