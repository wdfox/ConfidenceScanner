We aimed to evaluate safety and medium to long-term outcomes of bariatric procedures in this patient population.University Hospital, Canada.This is a single-center retrospective study of a prospectively collected database. We included patients aged \u226560 years who underwent sleeve gastrectomy, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, or biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch between January 2006 and December 2014 and had at least 2 years of follow-up.Of patients, 115 underwent bariatric surgeries (11 patients had 2 procedures). There were 66 were super-obese patients (body mass index>50 kg/m2). Of patients, 74% had sleeve gastrectomy, 16% Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, and 8% underwent biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch. Mean age and body mass index were 63.3 \u00b1 2.6 years and 51.7 \u00b1 8.1 kg/m2, respectively. Average follow-up time was 42 \u00b1 19 months. At baseline, 78% had hypertension, 60% had type 2 diabetes, and 30% had obstructive sleep apnea. There was no 30-day mortality. Complication rate was 14% (n = 16): 2 leaks post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, 1 leak post-biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch, 1 obstruction post-sleeve gastrectomy, 1 bleeding requiring transfusion, 1 liver injury with bile leak, 2 port-site hernias, 1 myocardial infarction, 2 gastrojejunal strictures, 1 wound infection, 1 urinary tract infection, and 3 gastric reflux exacerbations. Mean percent excess weight loss at 2 years was 52.2 \u00b1 23.8. Remission rates of hypertension, type-2 diabetes, and obstructive sleep apnea were 26%, 44%, and 38%, respectively.Bariatric surgery is safe and effective in improving obesity-related co-morbidities in older patients suffering from morbid obesity.
