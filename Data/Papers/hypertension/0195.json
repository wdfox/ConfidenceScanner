However, we experienced three cases having an aortic aneurysm as a complication of MPO-AAV with renal insufficiency. In one patient it involved the onset of descending aortic dissection during treatment for MPO-AAV; another two patients had an abdominal aortic aneurysm at the time of our diagnosis of MPO-AAV. Although we found no pathological evidence in our patients, MPO-AAV might result in large vessel inflammation. Therefore, we suggest that patients with MPO-AAV should be examined by computed tomography scan to check for the presence of an aortic aneurysm.", "id": "29318193", "date": "2017-12-29", "title": "Aortic Aneurysm as a Complication of Myeloperoxidase-antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody-associated Vasculitis.", "doi": "10.1515/med-2017-0065", "journal": ["Open medicine (Warsaw, Poland)", "Open Med (Wars)"]}
