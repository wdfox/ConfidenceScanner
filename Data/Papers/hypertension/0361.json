The pathophysiological relevance of this effect in atherosclerotic plaque calcification remains to be determined.We used Ldlr-/- mice with macrophage-specific loss of TRPC3 (MacTrpc3-/-/Ldlr-/-) to examine the effect of macrophage Trpc3 on plaque calcification and osteogenic features in advanced atherosclerosis.After 25 weeks on high fat diet, aortic root plaques in MacTrpc3-/-/Ldlr-/- mice showed reduced size, lipid and macrophage content compared to controls. Plaque calcification was decreased in MacTrpc3-/-/Ldlr-/- mice, and this was accompanied by marked reduction in BMP-2, Runx-2 and phospho-SMAD1/5 contents within macrophage-rich areas. Expression of Bmp-2 and Runx-2 was also reduced in bone marrow-derived macrophages from MacTrpc3-/-/Ldlr-/- mice.These findings show that, in advanced atherosclerosis, selective deletion of TRPC3 in macrophages favors plaque regression and impairs the activity of a novel macrophage-associated, BMP-2-dependent mechanism of calcification.", "id": "29290366", "date": "2017-12-22", "title": "Reduced calcification and osteogenic features in advanced atherosclerotic plaques of mice with macrophage-specific loss of TRPC3.", "doi": "10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2017.12.025", "journal": ["Atherosclerosis", "Atherosclerosis"]}
