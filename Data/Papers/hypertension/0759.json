Primary endpoint was improvements in time to PSA progression (TTPP).Totally, 313 patients were randomized (abiraterone: n\u00a0=\u00a0157; prednisone: n\u00a0=\u00a0156); and baseline characteristics were balanced. At clinical cut-off (median follow-up time: 3.9 months), 80% patients received treatment (abiraterone: n\u00a0=\u00a0138, prednisone: n\u00a0=\u00a0112). Median time to PSA progression was not reached with abiraterone versus 3.8 months for prednisone, attaining 58% reduction in PSA progression risk (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.418; p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Abiraterone-treated patients had higher confirmed PSA response rate (50% vs. 21%; relative odds\u00a0=\u00a02.4; p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and were 5 times more likely to achieve radiographic response than prednisone-treated patients (22.9% vs.\u00a04.8%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0369). Median survival was not reached. Most common (\u226510% abiraterone vs.\u00a0prednisone-treated) adverse events: bone pain (7% vs. 14%), pain in extremity (6% vs. 12%), arthralgia (10% vs. 8%), back pain (7% vs. 11%), and hypertension (15% vs. 14%).Interim analysis confirmed favorable benefit-to-risk ratio of abiraterone in chemotherapy-na\u00efve men with mCRPC, consistent with global study, thus supporting use of abiraterone in this patient population.", "id": "29264210", "date": "2017-01-23", "title": "A phase 3, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled efficacy and safety study of abiraterone acetate in chemotherapy-na\u00efve patients with mCRPC in China, Malaysia, Thailand and Russia.", "doi": "10.1016/j.ajur.2017.01.002", "journal": ["Asian journal of urology", "Asian J Urol"]}
