We investigated the optimal dose of dexmedetomidine for prevention of cough, agitation, hypertension, tachycardia, and shivering, with minimal side effects.In this prospective, randomized, double-blind trial, 216 adult patients were randomly assigned to dexmedetomidine 1 \u00b5g/kg (D 1), 0.5 \u00b5g/kg (D 0.5), 0.25 \u00b5g/kg (D 0.25), or control (C). During emergence, cough, agitation, hemodynamic parameters, shivering, time to extubation, and sedation scores were recorded.A total of 190 patients were analyzed. The respective incidences for the groups D 1, D 0.5, and D 0.25 versus group C were 48%, 64%, and 64% vs 84% for cough-corrected P < .003 between groups D 1 and C; 33%, 34%, and 33% vs 72% for agitation-corrected P < .003 between group C and each of the study groups; and 4%, 2%, and 7% vs 22% for shivering-corrected P = .03 and corrected P = .009 between groups D 1 and D 0.5 versus group C, respectively. The percent increase from baseline blood pressure on extubation for the 3 treatment groups was significantly lower than group C. Percent increase in heart rate was lower than control in groups D 1 and D 0.5 but not in group D 0.25. Time to extubation and sedation scores were comparable. However, more hypotension was recorded during the emergence phase in the 3 treatment groups versus group C.D 1 at the end of surgery provides the best quality of emergence from general anesthesia including the control of cough, agitation, hypertension, tachycardia, and shivering. D 0.5 also controls emergence phenomena but is less effective in controlling cough. The 3 doses do not delay extubation. However, they cause dose-dependent hypotension.", "id": "29293178", "date": "2017-12-29", "title": "Dexmedetomidine for Improved Quality of Emergence From General Anesthesia: A Dose-Finding Study.", "doi": "10.1213/ANE.0000000000002763", "journal": ["Anesthesia and analgesia", "Anesth.
