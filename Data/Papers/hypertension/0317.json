Switching between ingredients with the same indication was detected within a 30-day grace period. The proportion of days covered (PDC) and adherent status (cutoff 0.8) for each ingredient was calculated and compared between different censoring approaches: censoring drug switching (PDCswitch), censoring the end of dispensing (PDCend), and fixed 365-day period (PDC365). Overall, 854,380 (15.9%) patients in the Optum ClinFormatics (Optum) and 150,785 (22.0%) patients in the MarketScan Multi-state Medicaid (MDCD) had at least one switch within one year. Compared with PDC365 in Optum, PDCswitch means were higher: 0.85 vs. 0.41 for antihypertensive, 0.82 vs. 0.46 for antihyperglycemics, and 0.84 vs. 0.33 for antihyerlipidemia. Further, the percentages of adherent patients were higher: 95.8% vs. 17.9% for antihypertensive, 85.5% vs. 18.9% for antihyperglycemics, and 72.1% vs. 5.3% for antihyerlipidemia. Significant and modest changes were observed between PDCswitch and PDCend.", "id": "29295293", "date": null, "title": "The Impact of Censoring Drug Switching in Medication Adherence Measures of Chronic Single Ingredient Oral Drugs.", "doi": null, "journal": ["Studies in health technology and informatics", "Stud Health Technol Inform"]}
