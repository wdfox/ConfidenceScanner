Cathepsins are widely expressed in human various tissue and cells and they are involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension through activation of renin - angiotensin system, degradation of cytoplasmic matrix, proliferation of smooth muscle cell and hypertrophy of myocyte. The clinical studies have found that cathepsins can be used as a biomarker for hypertension. In recent years, the studies on the functions and mechanisms of cathepsins have provided a new sight and strategy for treatment of hypertension.\u5fc3\u810f\u4e0e\u8840\u7ba1\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u6539\u53d8\u6240\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5fc3\u6392\u51fa\u91cf\u3001\u8840\u5bb9\u91cf\u548c\u5916\u5468\u8840\u7ba1\u963b\u529b\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u662f\u9ad8\u8840\u538b\u53d1\u751f\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u75c5\u7406\u751f\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002\u7ec4\u7ec7\u86cb\u767d\u9176(cathepsin)A\uff0cB\uff0cK\uff0cL\u548cS\u7b49\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8868\u8fbe\u4e8e\u4eba\u4f53\u7ec4\u7ec7\u548c\u7ec6\u80de\u4e2d\u3002Cathepsin\u901a\u8fc7\u4fc3\u8fdb\u80be\u7d20-\u8840\u7ba1\u7d27\u5f20\u7d20\u7cfb\u7edf\u6fc0\u6d3b\u3001\u7ec6\u80de\u5916\u57fa\u8d28\u964d\u89e3\u3001\u5e73\u6ed1\u808c\u7ec6\u80de\u589e\u6b96\u548c\u5fc3\u808c\u7ec6\u80de\u80a5\u5927\u7b49\u673a\u5236\u53c2\u4e0e\u9ad8\u8840\u538b\u7684\u53d1\u751f\u53d1\u5c55\u3002\u4e34\u5e8a\u7814\u7a76\u4e5f\u53d1\u73b0cathepsin\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u8840\u538b\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u79cdcathepsin\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u53ca\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u9ad8\u8840\u538b\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u6cbb\u7597\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6cbb\u7597\u601d\u8def\u53ca\u7b56\u7565\u3002.", "id": "29317587", "date": null, "title": "[Progress in the study on roles of cathepsin in hypertension].", "doi": "10.11817/j.issn.1672-7347.2017.12.014", "journal": ["Zhong nan da xue xue bao.
