HDL-CEC was measured using specific cell-based radioisotopic assays; serum CLC and PCSK9 concentrations were measured fluorimetrically and by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively.The NUT combination significantly reduced plasma level of the total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-9.8% and -12.6%, respectively). Despite no changes in HDL-cholesterol, the NUT combination improved total HDL-CEC in 83% of the patients, by an average of 16%, as a consequence of the increase mainly of the ATP-binding cassette A1-mediated CEC (+28.5%). The NUT combination significantly reduced serum CLC (-11.4%) while it did not change PCSK9 plasma levels (312.9\u00b169.4 ng/mL vs 334.8\u00b1103.5 mg/L, before and after treatment, respectively).The present NUT combination improves the serum lipoprotein functional profile providing complementary beneficial effects, without any detrimental increase of PCSK9 plasma levels.", "id": "29270015", "date": "2017-12-11", "title": "Effect of a novel nutraceutical combination on serum lipoprotein functional profile and circulating PCSK9.", "doi": "10.2147/TCRM.S144121", "journal": ["Therapeutics and clinical risk management", "Ther Clin Risk Manag"]}
