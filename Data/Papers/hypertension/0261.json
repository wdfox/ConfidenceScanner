So far, there are 2 cases of WE reported after liver transplantation. Here, we report a case of a 45-year-old nonalcoholic male patient who developed psychiatric and neurological disturbance 15 d after receiving orthotopic liver transplantation because of hepatitis B-related cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed symmetric high-signal intensities in the periaqueductal area. The patient was diagnosed with WE and given intravenous high-dose vitamin B1 immediately. His neurological disturbance resolved in 7 d after receiving the vitamin B1. Brain MRI after 5 mo showed nearly complete recovery. Most WE cases may be misdiagnosed in patients after liver transplantation, and we should pay more attention to its onset.", "id": "29308003", "date": null, "title": "Wernicke encephalopathy in a patient after liver transplantation: A case report.", "doi": "10.3748/wjg.v23.i47.8432", "journal": ["World journal of gastroenterology", "World J.
