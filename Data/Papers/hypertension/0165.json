After finishing the course, hemodynamic and hemorheological parameters were measured.The antihypertensive treatment with amlodipine resulted in a significant decrease in mean blood pressure by 29% and left ventricular to body weight mass index by 7%. Nevertheless, BV tended to increase. The administration of amlodipine had no effect on PV, plasma fibrinogen concentration, RBC aggregation, and RBC deformability, but hematocrit was higher (by 6%) than it was in control group.These results demonstrate that amlodipine has no positive hemorheological improvements when administered to SHRs.", "id": "29326492", "date": null, "title": "Hemorheological effects of amlodipine in spontaneously hypertensive rats.", "doi": "10.4103/ijp.IJP_176_16", "journal": ["Indian journal of pharmacology", "Indian J Pharmacol"]}
