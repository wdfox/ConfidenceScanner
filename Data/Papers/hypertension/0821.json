Home delivery was noted in 30 cases (100%), umbilical sepsis in 8 (27%) and history of cow dung application over the umbilical cord in 2 cases (6.7%). Twenty-two cases (73.4%) presented with upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding while 18 (60%) were referred for pancytopenia and/or hypersplenism. The patients underwent a median of 3.2 sessions of endoscopic therapy for varices. Most patients (19/30, 63.4%) dropped out of serial endotherapy due to the paucity of funds. Shunt surgery was performed in 7 patients.Home delivery and umbilical sepsis are significant risk factors for EHPVO.
