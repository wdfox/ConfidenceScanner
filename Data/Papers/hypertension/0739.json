Therefore, it is of vital importance to determine the risk factors and the best possible strategies for diagnosis and treatment in patients with VBS that would minimize the risk of developing CKD. In this review we have presented the current knowledge of CKD risk factors in patients with posterior urethal value (PUV). We have also discussed possible recommendations for prenatal diagnostics procedures to be undertaken in patients with PUV, postnatal monitoring and therapeutic strategies that could reduce the risk of developing CKD in this population. Although in most cases there are no clear guidelines for appropriate clinical actions that can be undertaken in patients with PUV to minimize the risk of kidney failure, we have tried to present concise and accurate advice for physicians taking care of patients with PUV.", "id": "29264889", "date": null, "title": "Valve bladder syndrome in children: On the trail of the best strategies to prevent chronic kidney disease.", "doi": null, "journal": ["Advances in clinical and experimental medicine : official organ Wroclaw Medical University", "Adv Clin Exp Med"]}
