{"authors": [["Taimr", "Pavel", "P", null]], "text": "Liver transplantation should be considered in patients with end-stage liver disease in whom this operation would extend life expectancy beyond what the natural history of underlying disease would predict or in whom transplantation is likely to substantially improve the quality of life. Liver transplantation is indicated in end-stage liver disease, in selected liver tumors and in fulminant liver failure. The most common indication in adult to transplantation is decompensated liver cirrhosis with life expectancy one year or less. Evaluation and referral to transplantation center should be considered when a major complication of liver cirrhosis occurs - ascites, bleeding due to portal hypertension, hepatorenal syndrome or hepatic encephalopathy. MELD score 15 is recommended to list patients with end-stage liver disease. In recent years the indication of decompensated cirrhosis B and C is declining, on contrary, there is an increase in indication for hepatocellular carcinoma and NASH. An extension of indications has been observed recently - patients above 70 years of age, patients with neuroendocrine tumors among others. In 2016 in Czech Republic total 179 livers were transplanted, but only a small fraction of potential candidates was referred to transplant centers.", "id": "29336577", "date": null, "title": "[Indications to liver transplantation].", "doi": null, "journal": ["Casopis lekaru ceskych", "Cas.
