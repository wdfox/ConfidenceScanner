An SA\u2011AKI mouse model was established through an intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and Nec\u20111 was administered to the mice prior to the establishment of SA\u2011AKI. Renal function and histological changes were evaluated, and the expression levels of microtubule\u2011associated protein light chain 3\u2011II (LC3\u2011II) and p62, as markers of autophagic flux, were detected. Autophagosomes and autolysosomes in renal tubular epithelial cells were also identified using electron microscopy. Pretreatment with Nec\u20111 could attenuate the LPS\u2011induced increases in the concentrations of blood urea nitrogen (LPS+Nec\u20111 vs. LPS group, 14.15\u00b14.14\u00a0mmol/l vs. 32.54\u00b15.46\u00a0mmol/l, respectively; P<0.001) and serum creatinine (11.50\u00b11.67\u00a0\u00b5mol/l vs. 30.08\u00b14.18\u00a0\u00b5mol/l, respectively; P<0.001). However, there were no significant differences in the rate of renal tubular epithelial cell necrosis between the groups. In the renal tissues of SA\u2011AKI mice, protein analysis showed that the LC3\u2011II and p62 proteins were increased, while a reverse transcription\u2011quantitative Reverse transcription\u2011polymerase chain reaction analysis detected no increase in LC3\u2011II or p62 mRNA. Additionally, a high number of autophagosomes, but not of autolysosomes, were observed by electron microscopy. When mice were pretreated with Nec\u20111, the levels of LC3\u2011II and p62 decreased, and a large number of autolysosomes were observed by electron microscopy in the Nec\u20111 pretreatment group. These results indicated that Nec\u20111 improved autophagosome elimination, a process that is impaired by LPS, in renal tubular epithelial cells. This potentially enabled Nec\u20111 to prevent SA\u2011AKI. Furthermore, the findings suggested that the protective effect of Nec\u20111 may not have involved the inhibition of necroptosis, but may have occurred through the promotion of autophagosome elimination in renal tubular epithelial cells.", "id": "29257238", "date": "2017-12-07", "title": "Necrostatin-1 attenuates sepsis-associated acute kidney injury by promoting autophagosome elimination in renal tubular epithelial cells.", "doi": "10.3892/mmr.2017.8214", "journal": ["Molecular medicine reports", "Mol Med Rep"]}
