The ESH-IP Revision 2010 includes a total number of 33 subjects. For each measure, the difference between observer and device BP values was calculated. In all, 99 pairs of BP differences are classified into three categories (\u22645, \u226410, and \u226415 mmHg). The protocol procedures were followed precisely.QardioArm\u00ae and Omron M6 Comfort\u00ae fulfilled the requirements of the ESH-IP and passed the validation process successfully. For QardioArm\u00ae, a total of 69 out of 99 comparisons for systolic blood pressure (SBP) showed an absolute difference within 5 mmHg and 82 out of 99 for diastolic blood pressure (DBP). As for Omron M6 Comfort\u00ae, a total of 83 out of 99 comparisons for SBP showed an absolute difference within 5 mmHg and 77 out of 99 for DBP. The mean differences between the device and mercury readings were 0.7\u00b15.9 mmHg for SBP and 0.3\u00b14.1 mmHg for DBP for QardioArm\u00ae and -1.4\u00b14.7 mmHg for SBP and -2.1\u00b14.3 mmHg for DBP for Omron M6 Comfort\u00ae. With regard to part 2 of ESH-IP 2010, 27 out of 33 subjects had a minimum of two out of three measurements within 5 mmHg difference for SBP and 31 out of 33 subjects for DBP for the QardioArm\u00ae, and 29 out of 33 patients had a minimum of two out of three measurements within 5 mmHg difference for SBP and 26 out of 33 patients for DBP for Omron M6 Comfort\u00ae.QardioArm\u00ae and Omron M6 Comfort\u00ae readings differing from the mercury standard by <5, 10, and 15 mmHg fulfill the ESH-IP Revision 2010 requirements. Consequently, these two devices are suitable for use in the general population and non-insulin-dependent type II diabetic patients, respectively.", "id": "29343992", "date": "2017-12-27", "title": "Validation of BP devices QardioArm\u00ae in the general population and Omron M6 Comfort\u00ae in type II diabetic patients according to the European Society of Hypertension International Protocol (ESH-IP).", "doi": "10.2147/MDER.S142126", "journal": ["Medical devices (Auckland, N.Z.)", "Med Devices (Auckl)"]}
