Total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and hypertension-related symptoms were determined before and after the supplementation.There were no baseline differences between the two groups. Omega3Q10 supplementation significantly reduced diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (from 81.6\u2009\u00b1\u20095.3\u00a0mmHg to 79.3\u2009\u00b1\u20095.2\u00a0mmHg, P\u2009<\u20090.05). Blood concentrations of TC and LDL-C decreased significantly and blood HDL-C level increased significantly after 12\u00a0weeks of Omega3Q10 (5.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7 vs. 5.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5, P\u2009<\u20090.05; 3.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8 vs. 3.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6, P\u2009<\u20090.05; 1.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6 vs. 1.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5, P\u2009<\u20090.05, respectively) and soybean oil supplementation (5.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8 vs. 5.6\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7, P\u2009<\u20090.05; 3.6\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7 vs. 3.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8, P\u2009<\u20090.05; 1.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8 vs. 1.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7, P\u2009<\u20090.05, respectively) but no group differences were found. A significantly greater proportion of the people in the Omega3Q10 group became free from headache and palpitations & chest tightness symptoms after the 12-week supplementation compared to that of the soybean oil group (95.5% vs. 71.4%, P\u2009<\u20090.01; 95.8 vs. 75.5%, P\u2009<\u20090.01, respectively).12-week supplementation of Fish oil-based PUFA appear to be more effective in improving DBP and hypertension-related symptoms than soybean oil in old adults with hypertension and hypercholesterolemia although both supplementation improved TC, LDL-C and HDL-C concentrations.", "id": "29282085", "date": "2017-12-27", "title": "Effects of 12-week supplementation of marine Omega-3 PUFA-based formulation Omega3Q10 in older adults with prehypertension and/or elevated blood cholesterol.", "doi": "10.1186/s12944-017-0617-0", "journal": ["Lipids in health and disease", "Lipids Health Dis"]}
