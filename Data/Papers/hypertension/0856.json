Potassium channel subfamily\u00a0K member\u00a03 (TASK\u20111), a two\u2011pore domain K+\u00a0channel, is expressed in HPASMCs and is associated with hypoxic PAH. However, whether miR\u2011138 mediates PAH through targeting TASK\u20111 is not known. In the present study, HPASMCs were transfected with miR\u2011138 mimic to establish a PAH model in\u00a0vitro, and the effects of a miR\u2011138 inhibitor and a TASK\u20111 inhibitor (A293) were examined. Cell proliferation and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were measured by CCK\u20118 assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were performed to examine the expression of miR\u2011138, TASK\u20111, Bcl\u20112, caspase\u20113 and activation of extracellular signal\u2011regulated kinase\u00a01/2 (ERK1/2). A dual\u2011luciferase reporter assay was also used to analyse the expression level of TASK\u20111 in HPASMCs. The results of the present study demonstrated that the miR\u2011138 mimic promoted proliferation and MMP level, which was similar to the effect of A293 treatment on HPASMCs. However, the miR\u2011138 inhibitor inhibited the effects induced by miR\u2011138 mimic or A293 treatment, as demonstrated by a decrease in proliferation and MMP level in HPASMCs, accompanied by a decrease of Bcl\u20112 and an increase of caspase\u20113 expression levels, as well as ERK1/2 activation. The dual\u2011luciferase reporter assay indicated that TASK\u20111 expression was negatively regulated by miR\u2011138. The results of the present study suggested that miR\u2011138 promoted proliferation and suppressed mitochondrial depolarization of HPASMCs by targeting TASK\u20111.", "id": "29257242", "date": "2017-12-06", "title": "MicroRNA\u2011138 promotes proliferation and suppresses mitochondrial depolarization in human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells through targeting TASK\u20111.", "doi": "10.3892/mmr.2017.8200", "journal": ["Molecular medicine reports", "Mol Med Rep"]}
