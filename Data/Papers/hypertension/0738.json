Patients were identified through hospital medical records and were contacted approximately 1 year following their CS. Medical records and a questionnaire were used to identify features that were potentially associated with TE. Univariate analysis was used to determine the risk associated with these characteristics.A total of 2206 patients had a CS, of which 1377 (62%) participated. Of the respondents, 137 patients received heparin (94% received a prophylactic dose, 6% received a therapeutic dose) and the remainder, 1233 patients, did not receive heparin. Seven patients (0.5%) developed a TE and 86% developed a TE within 7 days of CS. The odds ratio (OR) for TE for women with hypertension prior to pregnancy compared to patients who did not receive anticoagulation was 21.28 [95% confidence interval (CI) 4.64-90.13] and for patients who had varicose veins with superficial thrombophlebitis when compared to patients who had received heparin postpartum was 21.01 (95% CI 1.55-288.24).Hypertension and the presence of varicose veins were associated with TE following CS. Larger cohort analyses are required to confirm these associations so that risk scores incorporating these characteristics may accurately predict the occurrence of TE.", "id": "29264952", "date": "2017-12-21", "title": "Thromboembolism following cesarean section: a retrospective study.", "doi": "10.1080/10245332.2017.1415245", "journal": ["Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)", "Hematology"]}
