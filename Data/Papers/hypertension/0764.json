The symptoms vary from asymptomatic hematuria to severe pelvic congestion. Celiacomes-enteric trunk anomaly is a rare variation of splanchnic artery anomaly that occurs when the celiac trunk and superior mesenteric arteries have a common origin from the aorta. A disease involving the rarely encountered celiacomesenteric trunk anomaly is extremely uncommon. To our knowledge, association between nutcracker syndrome and celiacomesentric trunk anomaly has not been reported in the literature.A 14-year-old boy with no significant past medical history presented with a 3-year painless hematuria. CT-angiogram revealed anterior nutcracker syndrome with celiacomesenteric trunk anomaly. The patient was managed conservatively with close follow-up.Nutcracker syndrome associated with celiacomesenteric trunk anomaly is extremely uncommon and is a rare cause of hematuria in children. Whether this abnormal anatomy is the cause of nutcracker syndrome or just an association should be investigated. Moreover, awareness of this anatomical variation may help in planning therapeutic options and reducing the chance of surgical iatrogenic injuries.", "id": "29263687", "date": "2017-12-13", "title": "Nutcracker syndrome associated with celiacomesentric trunk anomaly: case report.", "doi": "10.2147/IJNRD.S146814", "journal": ["International journal of nephrology and renovascular disease", "Int J Nephrol Renovasc Dis"]}
