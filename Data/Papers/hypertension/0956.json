It was shown to enhance cardiac contractility, and to exert a vasodilatory effect in all vascular beds. In some trials, the use of levosimendan was associated with cardioprotective effects. These distinctive qualities may be relevant to its use in a range of acute heart failure settings and/or complications, including acute coronary syndromes and cardiogenic shock. It is conjectured that part of the benefit of levosimendan may arise from restoration of ventriculo-arterial coupling via optimization of the ratio of arterial to ventricular elastance and the transfer of mechanical energy. Full confirmation of the effectiveness of levosimendan is still awaited in many of these scenarios; however, the range of potential applications highlights both the versatility of levosimendan and the relative lack of proven interventions in many of these situations.", "id": "29249904", "date": "2017-03-08", "title": "The inodilator levosimendan as a treatment for acute heart failure in various settings.", "doi": "10.1093/eurheartj/sux001", "journal": ["European heart journal supplements : journal of the European Society of Cardiology", "Eur Heart J Suppl"]}
