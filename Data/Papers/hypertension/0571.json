This study aimed to investigate the incidence of poor motion recovery after RTSA and to identify factors that may cause poor outcomes.Seventy-six patients who underwent primary RTSA with a reverse-type Aequalis prosthesis (Tornier, Montbonnot, France) were allocated to a satisfactory or unsatisfactory group on the basis of their postoperative active anterior elevation. The average age of the patients was 69\u2009\u00b1\u20098 years (range, 42-82 years); average follow-up period was 34\u2009\u00b1\u200912 months (range, 24-93 months).Fifty-eight patients had a satisfactory outcome (satisfactory group) and 18 had an unsatisfactory outcome (unsatisfactory group). Twenty-seven patients (46.6%) in the satisfactory group and 10 (55.6%) in the unsatisfactory group had preoperative pseudoparalysis (P\u2009=\u2009.504). Pre-existing medical comorbidities, such as thyroid disease, hypertension, diabetes, and smoking, showed no significant differences. Anterior deltoid muscle belly volume also did not significantly differ between the satisfactory and unsatisfactory groups. However, mean postoperative lateral humeral offset (LHO) was -2\u2009\u00b1\u20096\u2009mm in the satisfactory group and 3\u2009\u00b1\u20095\u2009mm in the unsatisfactory group (P\u2009=\u2009.001).Satisfactory improvement of active anterior elevation was achieved in three-quarters of patients who underwent RTSA using a prosthesis designed to be medialized. Of the factors we investigated, only postoperative LHO was found to be a significant risk factor for poor postoperative active anterior elevation. Therefore, surgeons should attempt to avoid increasing postoperative LHO when performing RTSA using an implant designed to be medialized.", "id": "29275846", "date": "2017-12-21", "title": "Factors associated with poor active anterior elevation after reverse total shoulder arthroplasty.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jse.2017.10.027", "journal": ["Journal of shoulder and elbow surgery", "J Shoulder Elbow Surg"]}
