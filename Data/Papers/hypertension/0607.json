Lowering blood pressure reduces target organ damage and prevents cardiovascular disease outcomes. The harmonized Canadian clinical practice guidelines for managing hypertension in people with diabetes provides health-behaviour advice and medical therapy recommendations for a threshold blood pressure of 130/80\u2009mmHg and above and to target blood pressure to below 130/80\u2009mmHg. We have reviewed the studies supporting these recommendations and others, and they appear to be at odds with the guidelines, including those for elderly people and patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease.", "id": "29273294", "date": "2017-12-20", "title": "Thresholds and Targets for Hypertension Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Remain at 130/80\u2009mmHg: What's the Evidence?", "doi": "10.1016/j.jcjd.2017.10.052", "journal": ["Canadian journal of diabetes", "Can J Diabetes"]}
