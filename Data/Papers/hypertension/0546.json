Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was calculated (CKD\u2011EPI formula) and albuminuria (AU) was determined as albumin/creatinine (A/Cr) ratio in the morning portion of urine. In 49.4% of patients decreased GFR 30 mg/g was detected. Decrease of GFR 30 mg/g - in 32.6%, combination of reduced GFR and high/very high AU - in 18%. High or very high level of combined risk of progression to CKD and cardiovascular complications had 28.5% of patients.", "id": "29276928", "date": null, "title": "[Prevalence of Markers of Chronic Kidney Disease in Patients With Arterial Hypertension: Results of Epidemiological Study CHRONOGRAF].", "doi": null, "journal": ["Kardiologiia", "Kardiologiia"]}
