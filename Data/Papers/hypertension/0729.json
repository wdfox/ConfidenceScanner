However, the clinical usefulness of TCD in diagnosing intracranial hypertension has not been demonstrated for intracranial diseases in dogs.To determine the association between the TCD variables and intracranial hypertension in dogs with intracranial diseases.Fifty client-owned dogs with neurologic signs.Cross-sectional study. All dogs underwent TCD of the basilar artery under isoflurane anesthesia after magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Dogs were classified into 3 groups based on MRI findings: no structural diseases (group I), structural disease without MRI evidence of intracranial hypertension (group II), and structural disease with MRI evidence of intracranial hypertension (group III). The TCD vascular resistance variables (resistive index [RI], pulsatility index [PI], and the ratio of systolic to diastolic mean velocity [Sm/Dm]) were measured.Fifteen, 22, and 13 dogs were classified into groups I, II, and III, respectively. Dogs in group III had significantly higher Sm/Dm (median, 1.78; range, 1.44-2.58) than those in group I (median, 1.63; range, 1.43-1.75) and group II (median, 1.62; range, 1.27-2.10). No significant differences in RI and PI were identified among groups.Our findings suggest that increased Sm/Dm is associated with MRI findings of suspected intracranial hypertension in dogs with intracranial diseases and that TCD could be a useful tool to help to diagnose intracranial hypertension.", "id": "29265506", "date": "2017-12-19", "title": "Transcranial Doppler Ultrasound Examination in Dogs with Suspected Intracranial Hypertension Caused by Neurologic Diseases.", "doi": "10.1111/jvim.14900", "journal": ["Journal of veterinary internal medicine", "J.
