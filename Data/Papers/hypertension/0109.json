In our retrospective series, PTC prevalence was approximately 0.18% and 0.15% in the LNG-IUS population versus 0.02% and 0.04% in the non-LNG-IUS population (Utah and Rigshospitalet, respectively), with no significant differences in PTC signs and symptoms among the two groups. Our investigation suggests that women with an LNG-IUS may have increased risk of developing PTC but does not suggest an LNG-IUS can cause PTC.", "id": "29344058", "date": "2017-04-19", "title": "An Estimation of the Risk of Pseudotumor Cerebri among Users of the Levonorgestrel Intrauterine Device.", "doi": "10.1080/01658107.2017.1304425", "journal": ["Neuro-ophthalmology (Aeolus Press)", "Neuroophthalmology"]}
