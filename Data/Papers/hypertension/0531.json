We aimed to validate this treatment strategy that is based on by the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging system.Patients undergoing liver resection were divided into two groups: patients with single HCC without portal hypertension (Group 1) and those with at least one factors of portal hypertension and multiple tumors, up to three lesions each \u22643\u00a0cm (Group 2). We compared survival and postoperative complications between the two groups.The median overall and recurrence-free survival periods of patients in Group 1 (n\u2009=\u2009695) were 8.5\u00a0years (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.6-9.0) and 2.4\u00a0years (2.2-2.7), respectively, and were significantly longer compared with those of patients in Group 2 (n\u2009=\u2009197) (5.6\u00a0years [95% CI, 4.8-6.7], P\u2009=\u20090.001, and 1.9\u00a0years [1.6-2.1], P\u2009<\u20090.001). On multivariate analysis, the independent factors for overall survival were hepatitis C virus infection (hazard ratio, 1.29 [95% CI, 1.02-1.65], P\u2009=\u20090.032), multiple tumors (1.42 [1.01-1.98], P\u2009=\u20090.040), and vascular invasion (1.66 [1.31-2.10], P\u2009<\u20090.001). Frequency of morbidity (23 [3.3%] patients vs 11 [5.5%] patients, P\u2009=\u20090.143) and mortality (3 [0.4%] patients vs 2 [1.0%] patients, P\u2009=\u20090.305) was not significantly different between the two groups.Patients with HCC with portal hypertension and/or multiple tumors could be candidates for liver resection due to the safety of the procedure.", "id": "29277961", "date": "2017-12-26", "title": "Liver resection of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with portal hypertension and multiple tumors.", "doi": "10.1111/hepr.13047", "journal": ["Hepatology research : the official journal of the Japan Society of Hepatology", "Hepatol.
