Patients of one group underwent mitral valve surgery (comparison group), in the other group mitral valve surgery was accompanied by pulmonary artery ablation (ablation group). Both groups had comparable anthropometric, echocardiographic, and hemodynamics characteristics.There were no hospital mortality and specific ablation-related complications. Left ventricular remodeling and decrease of pulmonary artery pressure were observed in both groups at discharge. On the third day after surgery systolic and mean pulmonary artery pressure assessed by right heart catheterization were 48 and 22 versus 59 and 39 mm Hg in ablation and comparison group, respectively (p.", "id": "29276914", "date": null, "title": "[Perspective Directions in Management of Severe Group Two Pulmonary Hypertension].", "doi": null, "journal": ["Kardiologiia", "Kardiologiia"]}
