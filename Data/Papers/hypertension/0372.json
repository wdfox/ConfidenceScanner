We previously showed that Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin (NGAL) is a novel target of MR signaling in CV tissue and plays a critical role in aldosterone/MR-dependent hypertension and fibrosis. We hypothesized that the production of NGAL by immune cells may play an important part in the mediation of these deleterious mineralocorticoid-induced effects. We analyzed the effect of aldosterone on immune cell recruitment and NGAL expression in vivo. We then studied the role of NGAL produced by immune cells in aldosterone-mediated cardiac inflammation and remodeling using mice depleted for NGAL in their immune cells by bone marrow transplantation and subjected to mineralocorticoid challenge NAS (Nephrectomy, Aldosterone 200\u03bcg/kg/day, Salt 1%). NAS treatment induced the recruitment of various immune cell populations to lymph nodes (granulocytes, B lymphocytes, activated CD8+ T lymphocytes) and the induction of NGAL expression in macrophages, dendritic cells, and PBMCs. Mice depleted for NGAL in their immune cells were protected against NAS-induced cardiac remodeling and inflammation. We conclude that NGAL produced by immune cells plays a pivotal role in cardiac damage under mineralocorticoid excess. Our data further stressed a pathogenic role of NGAL in cardiac damages, besides its relevance as a biomarker of renal injury.", "id": "29289651", "date": "2017-12-28", "title": "Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin from immune cells is mandatory for aldosterone-induced cardiac remodeling and inflammation.", "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2017.12.011", "journal": ["Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "J.
