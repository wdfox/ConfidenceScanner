Efficacy and tolerability were assessed over a 3-month period. The present paper describes results from prespecified subgroup analyses by age not reported elsewhere.Both age groups showed a clinically meaningful decrease in blood pressure (BP) over time (p<0.0001). The mean systolic and diastolic BP after approximately 3 months of barnidipine therapy was well below the target value of <140/90 mmHg for individual patients, with no notable differences between age groups. The decrease in mean pulse pressure was greater in patients >55 years (-10.8 mmHg) than in patients \u226455 years (-8.7 mmHg) (p<0.0001) and the proportion of patients with pulse pressure >60 mmHg decreased from 61.1% at baseline to 24.8% at Visit 3 in patients >55 years and from 47.7% to 16.5% in patients \u226455 years (p<0.0001).The overall incidence of adverse events was low, leading to treatment discontinuation in only 3.0-3.6% of patients. Peripheral edema, a common adverse effect with calcium channel blockers in clinical practice, was reported by 2.7% of patients aged <65 years and by 4.6% of patients aged \u226565 years.The efficacy and tolerability profiles of barnidipine as monotherapy or in combination with other antihypertensive drugs were shown to be favorable in both younger and older patients in a real-life practice setting. Randomized double-blind controlled studies are needed to confirm these results.", "id": "29290834", "date": "2017-11-17", "title": "Barnidipine Real-Life Efficacy and Tolerability in Arterial Hypertension: Results from Younger and Older Patients in the BASIC-HT Study.", "doi": "10.2174/1874192401711010120", "journal": ["The open cardiovascular medicine journal", "Open Cardiovasc Med J"]}
