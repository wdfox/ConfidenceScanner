In this study, the needle extract of 5LP was fractionated and analyzed by LC/MS/MS to search for possible antihypertensive candidates. In addition, bioassay-guided purification of the bioactive components was performed by Ca2+ fluorescent signal (Fluo 4-AM) assays. Two dihydrobenzofuran lignans, pinumorrisonide A (1) and icariside E4 (2), and one acylated flavonoid glycoside, kaempferol 3-O-\u03b1-(6\u2034-p-coumaroylglucosyl-\u03b2-1,4-rhamnoside) (3) were characterized from the active fractions. The structure of a new compound 1 was established on the basis of 2D NMR spectroscopic and mass spectrometric analyses, and the known compounds 2 and 3 were identified by comparison of their physical and spectroscopic data with those reported in the literature. The purified compounds 1-3 exhibited significant inhibition of Ca2+ fluorescence with IC50 values of 0.71, 0.36, and 0.20 mM, respectively. A mechanism study showed that these compounds showed vasorelaxant effects by blocking the voltage-operated Ca2+ channel (VOCC) and inhibiting Ca2+ influx to the cytoplasmic. These results suggested that 5LP and the three characterized components could be promising antihypertensive candidates for the use as VOCC blockers.", "id": "29301239", "date": "2017-12-31", "title": "Characterization of Vasorelaxant Principles from the Needles of Pinus morrisonicola Hayata.", "doi": "10.3390/molecules23010086", "journal": ["Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)", "Molecules"]}
