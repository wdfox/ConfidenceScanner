We present the case of an 83-year-old patient with refractory hypertension caused by paravisceral aortic stenosis including both renal arteries and the superior mesenteric artery. We planned an endovascular approach and treated the patient with parallel stent grafts in the paravisceral aorta. At 1.5\u00a0years after the operation, the patient was free of hypertensive episodes. Covered endovascular repair of the paravisceral aorta may be a valuable alternative to open aortic repair in patients unfit for open surgery. More research is needed to evaluate the long-term effects of this technique.", "id": "29349419", "date": "2017-07-24", "title": "Covered endovascular repair of the paravisceral aorta.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jvscit.2017.02.008", "journal": ["Journal of vascular surgery cases and innovative techniques", "J Vasc Surg Cases Innov Tech"]}
