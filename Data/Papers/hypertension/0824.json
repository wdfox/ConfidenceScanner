Mutations in genes highly expressed in podocytes have been found in two thirds of these patients, especially NPHS1 and NPHS2 among at least 29 genetic causes that have been discovered. We reported two siblings with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome caused by co-inheritance of mutations at NPHS1 (c.1339G>A, p.E447K) and ACDK4 (c.748G>C, p.D250H) genes. The siblings presented with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome and pathological lesions of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), while the elder sister also developed hypertension, renal failure and cardiac dysfunction.", "id": "29259860", "date": null, "title": "Steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome caused by co-inheritance of mutations at NPHS1 and ADCK4 genes in two Chinese siblings.", "doi": "10.5582/irdr.2017.01037", "journal": ["Intractable & rare diseases research", "Intractable Rare Dis Res"]}
