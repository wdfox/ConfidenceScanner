This study aimed to evaluate the risk of AF associated with use of DPP4i among a longitudinal cohort of patients with diabetes.Over a 3-year period, 480,000 patients with diabetes were analyzed utilizing Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database and 90,880 patients taking metformin as first-line therapy were enrolled. Patients were further divided into two groups: (1) DPP4i users: those taking DPP4i and (2) non-DPP4i users: those prescribed other hypoglycemic agents (HAs) as second-line drug. Study end point was defined by diagnosis of AF, addition of any third-line HA, or the end of the study period (December 31, 2013), whichever came first.A total of 16,017 DPP4i users and 74,863 non-DPP4i users were eligible for the study. For the DPP4i group, most patients were prescribed sitagliptin (n\u00a0=\u00a012,180; 76%). Among the non-DPP4i group, most patients took sulfonylurea (n\u00a0=\u00a060,606; 81%) as their second-line medication. DPP4i users were associated with a lower risk of new-onset AF compared with non-DPP4i users after propensity-score weighting (hazard ratio 0.65; P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Subgroup analysis showed that DPP4i user were associated with a lower risk of new-onset AF compared with non-DPP4i users in most subgroups. Multivariate analysis indicated that use of DPP4i was associated with lower risk of new-onset AF and age\u00a0>\u00a065\u00a0years, presence of hypertension, and ischemic heart disease were independent risk factors for new-onset AF.Among patients with diabetes prescribed with metformin, the patients with DPP4i as second HA were associated with a lower risk of AF compared with the patients with other drugs as second HAs in real-world practice.", "id": "29258504", "date": "2017-12-19", "title": "Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor decreases the risk of atrial fibrillation in patients with type 2 diabetes: a nationwide cohort study in Taiwan.", "doi": "10.1186/s12933-017-0640-5", "journal": ["Cardiovascular diabetology", "Cardiovasc Diabetol"]}
