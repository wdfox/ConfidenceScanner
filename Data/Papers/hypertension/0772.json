In the kidney, mutant CUL3 (CUL3-\u03949) increases abundance of With-No-Lysine [K] Kinase 4 (WNK4), with excessive activation of the downstream Sterile 20 (STE20)/SPS-1-related proline/alanine-rich kinase (SPAK) increasing phosphorylation of the Na+-Cl- cotransporter (NCC). CUL3-\u03949 promotes its own degradation via autoubiquitination, leading to the hypothesis that Cul3 haploinsufficiency causes FHHt. To directly test this, we generated Cul3 heterozygous mice (CUL3-Het), and Cul3 heterozygotes also expressing CUL3-\u03949 (CUL3-Het/\u03949), using an inducible renal epithelial-specific system. Endogenous CUL3 was reduced to 50% in both models, and consistent with autoubiquitination, CUL3-\u03949 protein was undetectable in CUL3-Het/\u03949 kidneys unless primary renal epithelia cells were cultured. Abundances of WNK4 and phosphorylated NCC did not differ between control and CUL3-Het mice, but they were elevated in CUL3-Het/\u03949 mice, which also displayed higher plasma [K+] and blood pressure. Abundance of phosphorylated Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter (NKCC2) was also increased, which may contribute to the severity of CUL3-\u03949-mediated FHHt. WNK4 and SPAK localized to puncta in NCC-positive segments but not in NKCC2-positive segments, suggesting differential effects of CUL3-\u03949. These results indicate that Cul3 haploinsufficiency does not cause FHHt, but dominant effects of CUL3-\u03949 are required.", "id": "29263298", "date": "2017-12-21", "title": "Mutant Cullin 3 causes familial hyperkalemic hypertension via dominant effects.", "doi": "10.1172/jci.insight.96700", "journal": ["JCI insight", "JCI Insight"]}
