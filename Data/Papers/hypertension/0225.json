Aging is the dominant risk factor for clinically significant atherosclerotic lesion formation, yet the heightened impact of aging on the disease is not accounted for by changes in traditional risk factors, such as lack of physical activity, smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or diabetes mellitus. This review will examine the pathological and biochemical processes of atherosclerotic plaque formation and growth, with particular focus on the aging risk vis-a-vis arterial homeostasis. Particular focus will be placed on the impact of a number of important contributors to arterial homeostasis including bone marrow (BM)-derived vascular progenitor cells, differential monocyte subpopulations, and the role of cellular senescence. Finally, this review will explore many critical observations in the way the disease process has been reassessed both by clinicians and researchers, and will highlight recent advances in this field that have provided a greater understanding of this aging-driven disease.", "id": "29312440", "date": "2017-12-14", "title": "The Aging Risk and Atherosclerosis: A Fresh Look at Arterial Homeostasis.", "doi": "10.3389/fgene.2017.00216", "journal": ["Frontiers in genetics", "Front Genet"]}
