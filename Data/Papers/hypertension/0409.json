In this review, by focusing on these distinctive aspects, we discuss how to provide an efficacious and safe management of CTD-PAH and garner attention to areas where further evidence is desired.", "id": "29285766", "date": "2017-12-28", "title": "Pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with connective tissue diseases: A review focusing on distinctive clinical aspects.", "doi": "10.1111/eci.12876", "journal": ["European journal of clinical investigation", "Eur.
