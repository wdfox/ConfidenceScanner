Traditional diagnostic criteria for pulmonary hypertension (PH), in this situation, may be unreliable due to the effects of positive pressure ventilation and vasoactive agents. The aim of this study is to describe the hemodynamic characteristics of PH secondary to ARDS, in relation with respiratory parameters. We assessed the hemodynamic, respiratory function, and ventilator parameters in a cohort of 38 individuals with ARDS-associated PH defined by mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP)\u2009\u2265\u200925\u2009mmHg. Individual characteristics: PaO2/FiO2\u2009=\u2009110\u2009\u00b1\u200960\u2009mmHg, alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (A-aO2)\u2009=\u2009549\u2009\u00b1\u2009148.9\u2009mmHg, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)\u2009=\u20098.7\u2009\u00b1\u20093.5\u2009cmH2O, pulmonary static compliance (Cstat)\u2009=\u200930\u2009\u00b1\u200912.1\u2009L*cmH2O-1, mPAP\u2009=\u200935.4\u2009\u00b16.6\u2009mmHg, pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP)\u2009=\u200915.6\u2009\u00b1\u20095.5\u2009mmHg, cardiac index (CI)\u2009=\u20093.4\u2009\u00b1\u20091.2\u2009L/min/m2, pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR)\u2009=\u20093.3\u2009\u00b1\u20091.6 Wood units (WU), right atrial pressure (RAP)\u2009=\u200913.4\u2009\u00b1\u20095.4\u2009mmHg, diastolic pulmonary gradient (DPG)\u2009=\u200912.6\u2009\u00b1\u20096.5\u2009mmHg, and trans-pulmonary gradient (TPG)\u2009=\u200919.7\u2009\u00b1\u20097.7\u2009mmHg. The composite marker-DPG\u2009>7\u2009mmHg and PVR\u2009>\u20093 WU-is associated with lower CI ( P\u2009=\u20090.016), higher mPAP ( P\u2009=\u20090.003), and lower pulmonary static compliance ( P\u2009=\u20090.028). We confirmed a poor prognosis of ARDS associated with PH, with a 50% survival rate after 17 days. We observed that the survival rate at 28 days was better in the case of improvement in the PaO2/FiO2 ratio in the first 24\u2009h (log rank P\u2009=\u20090.003). ARDS associated with PH is a severe condition with a very poor survival rate. The composite marker DPG\u2009>\u20097\u2009mmHg and PVR\u2009>\u20093 WU seemed to better describe the hemodynamic and respiratory dysfunction. The improvement in PaO2/FiO2 ratio in the first 24\u2009h defined a better survival in our cohort of patients.", "id": "29283029", "date": "2017-12-28", "title": "Hemodynamic profile of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in ARDS.", "doi": "10.1177/2045893217753415", "journal": ["Pulmonary circulation", "Pulm Circ"]}
