This study aimed to assess the effect of 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase type 1 (11\u03b2HSD1) inhibition by oral administration of RO5093151 on IOP.The exposure of key ocular compartments following oral administration was assessed in rabbits. An adaptive, randomised, placebo-controlled study gated by a Bayesian decision criterion was performed in 35 patients with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) or ocular hypertension (OHT). Following a 7-day placebo-controlled run-in period, 200\u2009mg twice daily RO5093151 or placebo (4:1) were administered for 7 days. The extent of 11\u03b2HSD1 inhibition was assessed by the ratio of urinary tetrahydrocortisol (5\u03b1 and 5\u03b2)/tetrahydrocortisone (THF/THE). Time-matched IOP assessments were performed.A high distribution of RO5093151 into the rabbit eye was observed. In humans, a high and sustained inhibition of 11\u03b2HSD1 was shown by the decrease of THF/THE from 0.9 at baseline to 0.18 on day 7. There was no statistically significant difference in change of IOP from baseline. In the 'worse eye', the adjusted least square mean change from baseline was -2.7\u2009mm Hg (95%\u2009CI -4.2 to -1.2) and -2.9(95% CI -5.9 to 0.1) in the RO5093151 and placebo group, respectively.Despite high inhibition of 11\u03b2HSD1 and expected moderate to high tissue distribution in ocular tissues, a 7-day treatment with a high oral dose of RO5093151 did not result in a clinically meaningful effect on IOP in patients with POAG or OHT.", "id": "29354707", "date": "2017-06-29", "title": "Oral administration of the 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase type 1 inhibitor RO5093151 to patients with glaucoma: an adaptive, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical study.", "doi": "10.1136/bmjophth-2016-000063", "journal": ["BMJ open ophthalmology", "BMJ Open Ophthalmol"]}
