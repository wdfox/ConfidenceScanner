In this sub-study, patients were analyzed according to non-TV related AE, defined as the composite of either non-TV revascularization (non-TVR) or non-TV related myocardial infarction (MI). At 5-year follow-up, 125 patients (8.3%) exhibited 136 non-TV related AE [124 (8.3%) non-TVR, 12 (0.8%) non-TV related MI], accounting for 47.1% of overall 289 non-fatal cardiac events. These patients had a higher incidence of diabetes mellitus (p<0.001), arterial hypertension (p=0.032), previous MI (p=0.073), multivessel disease (p<0.001), incomplete revascularization (p=0.049) and a lower rate of ST segment resolution > 70% (p=0.042) as compared to the rest. At Cox analysis, previous MI (HR 1.872, 95%CI 1.004 - 3.489; p= 0.048), incomplete revascularization (HR 1.746, 95%CI 1.029 - 2.963; p=0.039) and diabetes (HR 1.942, 95%CI 1.292 - 2.919; p= 0.001) were independent correlates of non-TV related AE.In STEMI patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention, previous MI, incomplete revascularization and diabetes resulted as independent correlates of 5-year non-TV related AE.", "id": "29260713", "date": "2017-12-19", "title": "Correlates of non-target vessel related adverse events in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: insights from 5-year follow-up of the EXAMINATION trial.", "doi": "10.4244/EIJ-D-17-00608", "journal": ["EuroIntervention : journal of EuroPCR in collaboration with the Working Group on Interventional Cardiology of the European Society of Cardiology", "EuroIntervention"]}
