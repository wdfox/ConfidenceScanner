The exact etiology and pathogenesis of PH remain to be elucidated, however there is novel evidence that implicates abnormal endothelial cells (ECs) apoptosis and dysfunction of ECs to be involved in the initiation of PH. Asiaticoside (AS) is a saponin monomer extracted from a medicinal plant called Centella\u00a0asiatica, which had a preventing effect of hypoxia\u2011induced pulmonary hypertension (hypoxic PH) by blocking transforming growth factor\u2011\u03b21/SMAD family member\u00a02/3 signaling in our previous study. The present study demonstrated that AS can prevent the development of hypoxic PH and reverse the established hypoxic PH. AS may activate the nitric oxide (NO)\u2011mediated signals by enhancing the phosphorylation of serine/threonine\u2011specific protein kinase/eNOS, thus promoting NO production, and prevent ECs from hypoxia\u2011induced apoptosis. All these findings imply that AS may be a potential therapeutic option for hypoxic PH patients due to its effect on the vitality and function of endothelial cells.", "id": "29257311", "date": "2017-12-12", "title": "Effect of asiaticoside on endothelial cells in hypoxia\u2011induced pulmonary hypertension.", "doi": "10.3892/mmr.2017.8254", "journal": ["Molecular medicine reports", "Mol Med Rep"]}
