The authors sought to assess the clinical utility of commonly used perioperative echocardiographic and right heart catheter measurements in patients undergoing PEA.A single-center prospective observational study.The study was conducted in a quaternary care cardiac surgical center in the United Kingdom.Patients undergoing PEA between April 2015 and January 2016.Thermodilution cardiac index and echocardiography variables were measured at 3 time points: before sternotomy (T1), after pericardial incision (T2), and after sternal closure (T3). Six-month follow-up echocardiography and 6-minute walk (6-MWT) test were performed.Fifty patients were recruited and complete data sets were available for 41 patients. Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion declined after pericardial incision and cardiopulmonary bypass (T1: 15 \u00b1 4 mm, T2: 13 \u00b1 4 mm, T3: 7 \u00b1 2 mm; p < 0.0001), returning to baseline 6 months postoperatively. Cardiac index (T1: 2.5 \u00b1 0.7 L/min/m2, T2: 2.6 \u00b1 0.6 L/min/m2, T3: 2.3 \u00b1 0.5 L/min/m2; p = 0.07) and right ventricular fractional area change (T1: 36 \u00b1 11%, T2: 40 \u00b1 12%, T3: 40 \u00b1 9%; p = 0.12) were preserved perioperatively. 6-MWT improved from baseline (294 \u00b1 111 m) to follow-up (357 \u00b1 107 m) (p < 0.001). Pulmonary vascular resistance at T3 correlated moderately with follow-up 6-MWT (R = -0.60).In patients undergoing PEA, invasive measurements and echocardiography assessment of right ventricular function are not interchangeable. Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion is not a reliable measure of right ventricular function perioperatively. Pulmonary vascular resistance shows moderate correlation with postoperative functional capacity.", "id": "29310938", "date": "2017-09-21", "title": "Evaluation of the Clinical Utility of Transesophageal Echocardiography and Invasive Monitoring to Assess Right Ventricular Function During and After Pulmonary Endarterectomy.", "doi": "10.1053/j.jvca.2017.09.026", "journal": ["Journal of cardiothoracic and vascular anesthesia", "J.
