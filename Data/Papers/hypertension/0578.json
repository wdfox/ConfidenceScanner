A questionnaire was applied to assess chest pain within the preceding 6 months of the event and health system resources utilization. Determinants were identified by logistic regression.Preceding chest pain was reported by 61% of patients, 43% of these sought medical help, of whom less than half underwent ECG, and in 39% pain was attributed to a problem of the heart. Patients with hypertension were more likely to seek medical care (adjusted odds ratio, OR, 2.13, 95% CI 1.29-3.51), and former smokers (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.28-0.99) and patients of a higher social class (OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.05-0.48) were less likely to seek medical care. The performance of ECG was associated with male sex (OR 2.56, 95% CI 1.11-5.87), health subsystem coverage (OR 3.88, 95% CI 1.11-13.53), and living in the northeastern region (OR 9.07, 95% CI 4.07-20.24), whereas cognitive impairment (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.15-0.92) and being employed (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.14-0.97) were inversely associated.These results suggest there are opportunities to improve the diagnosis of myocardial ischemia before acute coronary events.", "id": "29275403", "date": "2017-12-23", "title": "Missed Opportunities in Symptomatic Patients before a First Acute Coronary Syndrome: The EPIHeart Cohort Study.", "doi": "10.1159/000484713", "journal": ["Cardiology", "Cardiology"]}
