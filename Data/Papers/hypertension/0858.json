The present study was designed to investigate the long\u2011term effect of prehypertensive losartan therapy on metabolic disorders in high\u2011fat\u2011fed spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), and to examine the role of epigenetic regulation of angiotensin II type\u00a01 receptor (AT1R) and AT1 receptor\u2011associated protein (ATRAP) expression in adipose tissue. A total of 32 4\u2011week\u2011old male SHRs were divided into four groups (n=8 rats/group): Standard chow; standard chow\u00a0+\u00a0losartan; high\u2011fat diet; and high\u2011fat diet\u00a0+\u00a0losartan. At 10\u00a0weeks of age, treatment with losartan was discontinued. Rats were followed up until 26\u00a0weeks of age. Obesity, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, abnormal adipokine secretion, larger adipocytes and decreased expression of markers of adipocyte differentiation were present in high\u2011fat\u2011fed SHRs, and were attenuated in losartan\u2011treated rats. The increased expression and promoter hypomethylation of AT1R subtype a (AT1aR) in the adipose tissue of high\u2011fat\u2011fed SHRs were reversed by treatment with losartan. No difference was observed in the expression and promoter methylation of AT1R subtype b (AT1bR) among the four groups. Decreased expression and promoter hypermethylation of ATRAP were demonstrated in the adipose tissue of high\u2011fat\u2011fed SHRs. However, losartan made no difference to the expression and promoter methylation of ATRAP. Prehypertensive losartan therapy may relieve metabolic disorders in the later life of high\u2011fat\u2011fed SHRs. Differential epigenetic regulation of AT1aR and ATRAP expression through DNA methylation in adipose tissue may be involved in the long\u2011term beneficial effect.", "id": "29257219", "date": "2017-11-15", "title": "Effect of prehypertensive losartan therapy on AT1R and ATRAP methylation of adipose tissue in the later life of high\u2011fat\u2011fed spontaneously hypertensive rats.", "doi": "10.3892/mmr.2017.8081", "journal": ["Molecular medicine reports", "Mol Med Rep"]}
