Wight and Arn. (TA) belonging to family Combretaceae.To evaluate the anti-hyperglycemic and anti-hyperlipidemic effect of Arjunarisht on high-fat diet fed animals.High-fat diet fed (HFD) Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups and treated with phytochemically standardized Arjunarisht (1.8\u00a0ml/kg), and hydroalcoholic extract of T.\u00a0arjuna (TAHA) (250\u00a0mg/kg) and rosuvastatin (10\u00a0mg/kg), for 3 months. Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test, blood biochemistry, liver triglyceride and systolic blood pressure were performed in all the groups. Effect of these drugs on the expression of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and peroxisome proliferators activated receptor \u03b3 coactivator 1-\u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1) were studied in liver tissue using Quantitative Real-time PCR.HFD increased fasting blood glucose, liver triglyceride, systolic blood pressure and gene expression of TNF-\u03b1, IRS-1 and PGC-1\u03b1. Treatment of AA and TAHA significantly reduced fasting blood glucose, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol and triglyceride levels. These treatments significantly decreased gene expression of TNF-\u03b1 (2.4, 2.2 and 2.6 fold change); increased IRS-1 (2.8, 2.9 and 2.8 fold change) and PGC-1\u03b1 (2.9, 3.7 and 3.3 fold change) as compared to untreated HFD.Anti-hyperglycemic, anti-hyperlipidemic effect of Arjunarisht may be mediated by decreased TNF-\u03b1 and increased PGC-1\u03b1 and IRS-1.", "id": "29249636", "date": "2017-12-14", "title": "Anti-hyperglycemic and anti-hyperlipidaemic effect of Arjunarisht in high-fat fed animals.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jaim.2017.07.004", "journal": ["Journal of Ayurveda and integrative medicine", "J Ayurveda Integr Med"]}
