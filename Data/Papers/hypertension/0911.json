The medical records of 190 brain injury patients were retrospectively reviewed. Blood glucose levels in the poor recovery group were significantly higher than in the good recovery group, particularly during the first 72 hr (158-172 mg/dl). The poor recovery group showed persistent, fluctuating hyperglycemia, whereas the good recovery group exhibited hyperglycemic peaks during the first 3 days that subsequently reduced linearly to normal. Gender, preexisting hypertension, disease severity at admission, total calorie intake, and steroid use were found to influence stress-induced hyperglycemia development significantly. In conclusion, close monitoring and adjustment are required to maintain safe blood glucose levels and the development of protocols for safe glycemic management is essential to improve critical care in brain injury patients.", "id": "29254374", "date": "2017-12-01", "title": "Temporal Patterns and Influential Factors of Blood Glucose Levels During the First 10-Day Critical Period After Brain Injury.", "doi": "10.1177/1054773817749725", "journal": ["Clinical nursing research", "Clin Nurs Res"]}
