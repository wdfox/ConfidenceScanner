The goal of our research was to examine whether elevation of plasma FFA impairs mitochondrial function and alters PGC-1\u03b1 promoter methylation.In this uncontrolled, change from baseline study design, insulin sensitivity and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion were measured in 9 normal glucose tolerant subjects before and after 3 day lipid infusion to elevate plasma FFA concentration. Vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were obtained and mitochondrial function, PGC-1\u03b1 expression, and PGC-1\u03b1 promoter methylation were quantitated.Increased plasma FFA (440\u00b193 \u03bcmol/Lto 997\u00b1242 \u03bcM, p<0.001) decreased insulin-stimulated total glucose disposal (TGD) by 25% (p = 0.008), impaired suppression of endogenous glucose production (p = 0.01), and reduced mitochondrial ATP synthesis with complex 1 (34%, p<0.05) and complex 2 (30%, p<0.05) substrates. Lipid infusion had no effect on muscle PGC-1\u03b1 RNA expression, total methylation or non-CpG methylation, but methylation of the alternative PGC-1\u03b1 promoter decreased (1.30\u00b10.30 to 0.84\u00b10.15% methylated residues/patient\u2022strand, p = 0.055). Within PGC-1\u03b1 promoter there was demethylation of CpT residues (0.72\u00b10.16 vs. 0.28\u00b10.10 methylated residues/patient\u2022strand) (p = 0.002), which was inversely correlated with PGC-1\u03b1 mRNA expression (r = -0.94, p<0.0001) and ATP synthesis with complex 1 (r = -0.80, p<0.01) and complex 2 (r = -0.69, p<0.05) substrates. Lipid infusion increased DNMT-3B (methyltransferase associated with PGC-1\u03b1 promoter non-CpG methylation) mRNA expression (0.87 \u00b1 0.09 to 1.62 \u00b1 0.22 arbitrary units, p = 0.005), which correlated inversely with CpT demethylation (r = 0.67, p<0.05).Physiologic plasma FFA elevation in NGT individuals has opposing effects on PGC-1\u03b1 non-CpG residue methylation (CpT demethylation and increased DNMT-3B expression), which is correlated with changes in PGC-1\u03b1 expression and skeletal muscle mitochondrial function.", "id": "29261667", "date": "2017-12-20", "title": "Increased lipid availability for three days reduces whole body glucose uptake, impairs muscle mitochondrial function and initiates opposing effects on PGC-1\u03b1 promoter methylation in healthy subjects.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0188208", "journal": ["PloS one", "PLoS ONE"]}
