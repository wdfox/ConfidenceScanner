A random-effects model and generic inverse variance method were used for quantitative data synthesis. Sensitivity analysis was conducted using the leave-one-out method. A weighted random-effects meta-regression was performed to evaluate the impact of potential confounders on glycemic parameters.This meta-analysis of data from 22 randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials involving a total of 11,402 subjects showed that fibrate therapy significantly decreased fasting plasma glucose (WMD: -0.28\u202fmmol/L, 95% CI: -0.42, -0.14, p\u202f<\u202f0.001), insulin levels (WMD: -3.87\u202fpmol/L, 95% CI: -4.97, -2.78, p\u202f<\u202f0.001) and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR, WMD: -1.09, 95% CI: -1.71, -0.47, p\u202f=\u202f0.001), but with no effect on HbA1c (WMD: 0.01%, 95% CI: -0.18, 0.19, p\u202f=\u202f0.955). All analyses were robust in the leave-one-out sensitivity analysis except for insulin levels that showed a non-significant result (WMD: -0.84\u202fpmol/L, 95% CI: -6.36, 4.68, p\u202f=\u202f0.766) following omission of one of the included trials.This meta-analysis has shown that fibrate treatment significantly decreases fasting plasma glucose, insulin levels, and HOMA-IR indicating additional clinical therapeutic benefits.", "id": "29292213", "date": "2017-12-29", "title": "Effect of fibrates on glycemic parameters: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials.", "doi": "10.1016/j.phrs.2017.12.030", "journal": ["Pharmacological research", "Pharmacol.
