Despite anticoagulation, the pulmonary artery lesion progressed and a mass-like lesion developed in the right ventricular outflow tract. Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was applied before surgery due to the presence of severe right-side heart failure with pulmonary hypertension. A round mass was found in the right ventricle and separate lobulated masses were found in both pulmonary arteries, and these were consistent with low-grade myxofibrosarcoma.", "id": "29312771", "date": null, "title": "Low grade myxofibrosarcoma in the right ventricle presenting as pulmonary thromboembolism.", "doi": "10.21037/jtd.2017.11.13", "journal": ["Journal of thoracic disease", "J Thorac Dis"]}
