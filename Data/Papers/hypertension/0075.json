The Micromedex Drug-Reax\u00ae system was used to screen patient profiles for pDDIs, and IBM SPSS version 20 was used to carry out statistical analysis.We evaluated 209 medical charts and found pDDIs in nearly 78.5% CKD patients. Overall, 541 pDDIs were observed, of which, nearly 60.8% patients had moderate, 41.1% had minor, 27.8% had major, and 13.4% had contraindicated interactions. Among those interactions, 49.4% had good evidence, 44.0% had fair, 6.3% had excellent evidence, and 35.5% interactions had delayed onset of action. The potential adverse outcomes of pDDIs included postural hypotension, QT prolongation, ceftriaxone-calcium precipitation, cardiac arrhythmias, and reduction in therapeutic effectiveness. The occurrence of pDDIs was found strongly associated with the age of <60 years, number of prescribed medicines \u22655, hypertension, and the lengthy hospitalization of patients.The occurrence of pDDIs was high in CKD patients. It was observed that CKD patients with an older age, higher number of prescribed medicines, lengthy hospitalization, and hypertension were at a higher risk of pDDIs.", "id": "29354553", "date": "2017-02-17", "title": "Clinical relevancy and determinants of potential drug-drug interactions in chronic kidney disease patients: results from a retrospective analysis.", "doi": "10.2147/IPRP.S128816", "journal": ["Integrated pharmacy research & practice", "Integr Pharm Res Pract"]}
