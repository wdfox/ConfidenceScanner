Methods This cross-sectional study included newly diagnosed hypertensive patients who underwent 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor (ABPM) between January 2009 and 2012 in Jiangning city. Patients were divided into the dipper group and the non-dipper group according to ABPM measurements. The levels of SCF and its receptor c-kit, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in peripheral blood were measured via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The serum levels of glucose and lipid were examined as well. The levels of SCF/c-kit were compared between the dippers and the non-dippers; and their correlation with 24-hour mean systolic blood pressure (MSBP), 24-hour mean diastolic blood pressure (MDBP), TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 were investigated using linear regression analyses statistically. Results A total of 247 patients with newly diagnosed hypertension were recruited into the study, including 116 non-dippers and 131 dippers. The levels of peripheral plasma SCF were higher in non-dipper group (907.1\u00b152.7 ng/L vs. 778.7\u00b144.6 ng/L; t=2.837, P<0.01), and the levels of c-kit were higher in non-dipper group too (13.2\u00b11.7 \u03bcg/L vs 9.57\u00b11.4 \u03bcg/L; t=2.831, P<0.01). Linear regression analysis revealed that SCF/c-kit levels were significantly positively correlated with MSBP, MDBP, plasma TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6 levels (all P<0.01). Conclusions Peripheral plasma SCF/c-kit levels are higher in patients with non-dipper hypertension than those with dipper one, and significantly correlate with 24-hour MSBP, 24-hour MDBP, serum TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 levels.", "id": "29301598", "date": null, "title": "Plasma SCF/c-kit Levels in Patients with Dipper and Non-Dipper Hypertension.", "doi": "10.24920/J1001-9294.2017.035", "journal": ["Chinese medical sciences journal = Chung-kuo i hsueh k'o hsueh tsa chih", "Chin.
