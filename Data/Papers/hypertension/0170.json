However, little is known about their prognostic impact in hospitalized patients with IPF. We examined the impact of respiratory comorbidities on the mortality rates of hospitalized patients with IPF using a Japanese nationwide database.We identified 5665 hospitalized patients diagnosed with IPF between April 2010 and March 2013. The primary outcome was defined as the in-hospital mortality at 30 days after admission. The impact of respiratory comorbidities was assessed using a Cox proportional hazards model that incorporated clinically relevant factors.In hospitalized patients with IPF, the prevalence of bacterial pneumonia, pulmonary hypertension, and lung cancer were 9.5%, 4.6%, and 3.7%, respectively. Among patients with bacterial pneumonia, the four most common pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae (31.6%), methicillin-resistant Streptococcus aureus (18.4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.2%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9.2%). Lung cancer was more commonly found in the lower lobes (60.1%) than in other lobes. The survival at 30 days from admission was 78.4% in all patients and significantly lower in IPF patients with bacterial pneumonia (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.30; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.63; p < 0.023) and patients with lung cancer (adjusted HR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.47-2.69; p < 0.001) than in others. Pulmonary hypertension was not associated with mortality. IPF patients with one or more of these three respiratory comorbidities had a poorer survival than others (p < 0.05).Respiratory comorbidities, especially bacterial pneumonia and lung cancer, influence mortality in hospitalized patients with IPF.", "id": "29325684", "date": "2017-12-23", "title": "Respiratory comorbidities and risk of mortality in hospitalized patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.", "doi": "10.1016/j.resinv.2017.09.006", "journal": ["Respiratory investigation", "Respir Investig"]}
