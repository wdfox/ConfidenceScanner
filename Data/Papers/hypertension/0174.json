Methods: A retrospective study was conducted on 78 cases of pregnancies complained with pulmonary hypertension who delivered in the First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University from 2006 to 2016.The selected cases were divided into three groups according to severity of pulmonary hypertension: mild pulmonary hypertension group (mild PAH group) was defined as a mean pulmonary artery pressure 30-49 mmHg, moderate pulmonary hypertension (moderate PAH group) as mean pulmonary artery pressure 50-69 mmHg and severe pulmonary hypertension (severe PAH group) as mean pulmonary artery pressure 70 mmHg or greater.The clinical features, risk pregnant complication, maternal and neonatal outcomes were described between these three groups.Analysis of variance, Chi-square test was used for statistical analysis. Results: The average age of mild, moderate and severe PAH group were (31\u00b15) years old, (31\u00b15) years old and (27\u00b13) years old, respectively (P=0.050). The rate of natural fertilization (P=0.414), parity (P=0.527) and gestational age (P=0.165) were similar in these three groups. In 78 pregnancies with pulmonary hypertension, 64.9% of pregnancies in mild PAH group was NYHA \u2160, 50.0% of moderate PAH group was NYHA \u2161 and 54.5% of severe PAH group was NYHA \u2162(P<0.001). There was no significant difference in the incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM, P=0.589), preeclampsia (P=0.942), premature rupture of membrane (PROM, P=0.276), scarred uterus (P=0.493) and postpartum hemorrhage (P=0.424). The cesarean section rate was 84.2%, 90.0% and 63.6% in three groups (P=0.208). However, neuraxial anesthesia was performed in 82.5% of cases in mild PAH and 90.0% of cases in moderate PAH, while 27.3% of cases of severe PAH underwent neuraxial anesthesia (P<0.001). The fetal outcome was similar in there groups.But the rate of admission of NICU was significantly different in three groups (P=0.011). Conclusions: Maternal and neonatal outcomes was similar in different severity of pulmonary hypertension.But the severity of pulmonary hypertension affect the type of anesthesia.Close monitoring during pregnancy and timely termination of pregnancy can improve the outcome of pregnancy.\u76ee\u7684\uff1a \u63a2\u8ba8\u4e0d\u540c\u7a0b\u5ea6\u80ba\u52a8\u8109\u9ad8\u538b(PAH)\u5bf9\u598a\u5a20\u7ed3\u5c40\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002 \u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a \u57282006\u5e741\u6708\u81f32016\u5e7412\u6708\u5728\u4e2d\u5c71\u5927\u5b66\u9644\u5c5e\u7b2c\u4e00\u533b\u9662\u4f4f\u9662\u768478\u4f8b\u598a\u5a20\u5408\u5e76PAH\u5b55\u4ea7\u5987\u4e2d\uff0c\u56de\u987e\u75c5\u4f8b\u8d44\u6599\uff0c\u6309PAH\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5206\u4e3a\u8f7b\u5ea6PAH\u7ec4(\u8f7b\u5ea6PAH\u7ec4)\u3001\u4e2d\u5ea6PAH\u7ec4(\u4e2d\u5ea6PAH\u7ec4)\u548c\u91cd\u5ea6PAH\u7ec4(\u91cd\u5ea6PAH\u7ec4)\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684PAH\u598a\u5a20\u671f\u7279\u70b9\u548c\u6bcd\u80ce\u7ed3\u5c40\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u65b9\u5dee\u5206\u6790\u8fdb\u884c\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u5904\u7406\u3002 \u7ed3\u679c\uff1a \u8f7b\u5ea6PAH\u7ec4\u5b55\u5987\u5e73\u5747\u5e74\u9f84\u4e3a(31\u00b15)\u5c81\uff0c\u4e2d\u5ea6PAH\u7ec4\u5e73\u5747\u5e74\u9f84(31\u00b15)\u5c81\uff0c\u91cd\u5ea6PAH\u7ec4\u5e73\u5747\u5e74\u9f84(27\u00b13)\u5c81\uff0c\u7ec4\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u65e0\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49(P\uff1d0.050)\u30023\u7ec4\u5b55\u5987\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u53d7\u5b55\u7387(P\uff1d0.414)\u3001\u521d\u4ea7\u60c5\u51b5(P\uff1d0.527)\u548c\u5206\u5a29\u5b55\u5468(P\uff1d0.165)\u5747\u5dee\u5f02\u65e0\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u8f7b\u5ea6PAH\u7ec4\u4e2d\u5fc3\u529f\u80fd\u2160\u7ea7\u536064.9%\uff0c\u4e2d\u5ea6PAH\u7ec4\u5fc3\u529f\u80fd\u2161\u7ea7\u536050.0%\uff0c\u91cd\u5ea6PAH\u7ec4\u5fc3\u529f\u80fd\u2162\u7ea7\u536054.5%\uff0c\u7ec4\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49(P<0.001)\u3002\u4e0d\u540c\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684PAH\u5b55\u5987\u7684\u598a\u5a20\u671f\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5(P\uff1d0.589)\u3001\u5b50\u75eb\u524d\u671f(P\uff1d0.942)\u3001\u80ce\u819c\u65e9\u7834(P\uff1d0.276)\u3001\u7622\u75d5\u5b50\u5bab(P\uff1d0.493)\u548c\u4ea7\u540e\u51fa\u8840(P\uff1d0.424)\u5dee\u5f02\u65e0\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u8f7b\u3001\u4e2d\u3001\u91cd\u5ea6PAH\u7ec4\u5256\u5bab\u4ea7\u7387\u5206\u522b\u4e3a84.2%\u300190.0%\u548c63.6%\uff0c\u7ec4\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u65e0\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49(P\uff1d0.208)\u3002\u8f7b\u5ea6PAH\u7ec4\u4e2d82.5%\u7684\u5b55\u5987\u9009\u62e9\u690e\u7ba1\u5185\u9ebb\u9189\uff0c\u4e2d\u5ea6PAH\u7ec4\u670990.0%\u9009\u62e9\u690e\u7ba1\u5185\u9ebb\u9189\uff0c\u91cd\u5ea6PAH\u7ec4\u4e2d\u4ec5\u670927.3%\u9009\u62e9\u690e\u7ba1\u5185\u9ebb\u9189\uff0c\u7ec4\u95f4\u9ebb\u9189\u65b9\u5f0f\u5dee\u5f02\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49(P<0.001)\u3002\u8f7b\u3001\u4e2d\u3001\u91cd\u7ec4PAH\u7ec4\u56f4\u4ea7\u513f(P\uff1d0.393)\u3001\u65b0\u751f\u513f\u7a92\u606f\u7387(P\uff1d0.581)\u548c\u5c0f\u4e8e\u80ce\u9f84\u513f\u53d1\u751f\u7387(P\uff1d0.324)\u5747\u5dee\u5f02\u65e0\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u4f463\u7ec4\u65b0\u751f\u513f\u8f6c\u79d1\u7387\u5206\u522b\u4e3a15.8%\u300140.0%\u548c54.5%\uff0c\u7ec4\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49(P\uff1d0.011)\u3002 \u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a \u4e0d\u540c\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684PAH\u7684\u5b55\u4ea7\u5987\u7684\u598a\u5a20\u7ed3\u5c40\u65e0\u660e\u663e\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u7ec8\u6b62\u598a\u5a20\u65b9\u5f0f\u548c\u9ebb\u9189\u65b9\u5f0f\u9009\u62e9\u6709\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u5b55\u671f\u4e25\u5bc6\u76d1\u6d4b\u548c\u9002\u65f6\u7ec8\u6b62\u598a\u5a20\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u6539\u5584\u5176\u598a\u5a20\u7ed3\u5c40\u3002.", "id": "29325324", "date": null, "title": "[Obstetric outcome in pregnancy complained with pulmonary hypertension].", "doi": null, "journal": ["Zhonghua yi xue za zhi", "Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi"]}
