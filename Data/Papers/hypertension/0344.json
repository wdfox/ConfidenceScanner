CT and MRI showed a lesion suggestive of metastasis without ruling out a glial type tumor. He was operated through a left FT craniotomy. During the surgery there was an arterial hemorrhage. The histological sample oriented toward an aneurysmal origin that was confirmed with ARM and angiography. A second intervention allowed the removal of a giant middle meningeal aneurysm partially thrombosed. Aneurysms of the middle meningeal artery are rare and generally present a traumatic history. No case of giant aneurysm has been found in the medical literature.", "id": "29292165", "date": "2017-12-29", "title": "[Non traumatic giant aneurysm of middle meningeal artery.
