The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of 6-month supplementation with omega-3 acids on selected markers of inflammation in patients with CKD stages 1-3.Six-month supplementation with omega-3 acids (2\u2009g/day) was administered to 87 CKD patients and to 27 healthy individuals. At baseline and after follow-up, blood was taken for C-reactive protein (CRP) and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) concentration and white blood cell (WBC) count. Serum concentration of omega-3 acids-eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA)-was determined using gas chromatography. And 24-hour urinary collection was performed to measure MCP-1 excretion.After six-month omega-3 supplementation, ALA concentration increased in CKD patients and in the reference group, while EPA and DHA did not change. At follow-up, a significant decrease in urinary MCP-1 excretion in CKD (p = 0.0012) and in the reference group (p = 0.001) was found. CRP, serum MCP-1, and WBC did not change significantly. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) did not change significantly in the CKD group.The reduction of urinary MCP-1 excretion in the absence of MCP-1 serum concentration may suggest a beneficial effect of omega-3 supplementation on tubular MCP-1 production.This study was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT02147002).", "id": "29349065", "date": "2017-11-19", "title": "Beneficial Effects of 6-Month Supplementation with Omega-3 Acids on Selected Inflammatory Markers in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease Stages 1-3.", "doi": "10.1155/2017/1680985", "journal": ["BioMed research international", "Biomed Res Int"]}
