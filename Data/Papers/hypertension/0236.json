This study explored the associations of health literacy (HL), food literacy (FL), and salt awareness with salt intake, K intake, and Na/K ratio in a workplace intervention trial in Switzerland.The study acquired baseline data from 141 individuals, mean age 44.6 years. Na and K intake were estimated from a single 24-h\u00a0urine collection. We applied validated instruments to assess HL and FL, and salt awareness. Multiple linear regression was used to investigate the association of explanatory variables with salt intake, K intake, and Na/K. Mean daily salt intake was 8.9\u00a0g, K 3.1\u00a0g, and Na/K 1.18. Salt intake was associated with sex (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and K intake with sex (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), age (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02), and waist-to-height ratio (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03), as was Na/K. HL index and FL score were not significantly associated with salt or K intake but the awareness variable \"salt content impacts food/menu choice\" was associated with salt intake (p\u00a0=\u00a00.005).To achieve the established targets for population Na and K intake, health-related knowledge, abilities, and skills related to Na/salt and K intake need to be promoted through combined educational and structural interventions.
