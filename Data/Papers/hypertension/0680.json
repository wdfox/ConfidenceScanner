Contrasting effects of nicotine exposure on endothelial function have been reported. The effect of non-smoking nicotine exposure on endothelial dysfunction during COC treatment remains to be fully elucidated. We therefore, sought to determine the effects of nicotine exposure during COC treatment on endothelial dysfunction mediators and circulating corticosteroids. Female Wistar rats aged 10\u2009weeks were given (po) vehicle, nicotine (1.0\u2009mg/kg) with or without COC steroids (1.0\u2009\u00b5g ethinylestradiol and 5.0\u2009\u00b5g levonorgestrel) daily for 6\u2009weeks. Nicotine exposure caused 113.3% increase in insulinemia whereas COC treatment led to 76.9% increased insulinemia compared with control. Furthermore, COC treatment or nicotine exposure led to glucose deregulation, insulin resistance, reduced nitric oxide bioavailability, elevated plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, uric acid, oxidative stress, atherogenic dyslipidemia, and corticosteroids. However, COC\u2009+\u2009NIC treatment led to 41.2% decrease in insulemina compared with COC-treated rats. Furthermore, all other alterations were alleviated by nicotine exposure in COC-treated female rats with the exception of corticosteroids.", "id": "29268635", "date": "2017-12-22", "title": "Nicotine exposure suppresses hyperinsulinemia and improves endothelial dysfunction mediators independent of corticosteroids in insulin-resistant oral contraceptive-treated female rats.", "doi": "10.1080/01480545.2017.1413109", "journal": ["Drug and chemical toxicology", "Drug Chem Toxicol"]}
