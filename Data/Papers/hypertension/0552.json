With the development of thrombotic occlusion of arteries of the lower extremities, the nature of the course of hypertension worsens. The operational recovery of the main blood flow in the limbs positively influences the course of hypertension in the majority of patients.", "id": "29276913", "date": null, "title": "[Change in the Nature of the Course of Arterial Hypertension in Patients With Chronic Arterial Insufficiency of the Extremities in Acute Thrombotic Occlusion].", "doi": null, "journal": ["Kardiologiia", "Kardiologiia"]}
