Mechanisms are unknown but could be explained through impaired neural baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) and/or large artery stiffness. This study aimed to determine the associations of carotid BRS and carotid stiffness with exaggerated exercise BP.Blood pressure was recorded at rest and following an exercise step-test among 8976 adults aged 50 to 75\u2009years from the Paris Prospective Study III. Resting carotid BRS (low frequency gain, from carotid distension rate, and heart rate) and stiffness were measured by high-precision echotracking. A systolic BP threshold of\u2009\u2265\u2009150\u00a0mmHg defined exaggerated exercise BP and \u2265140/90\u00a0mmHg defined resting hypertension (\u00b1antihypertensive treatment). Participants with exaggerated exercise BP had significantly lower BRS [median (Q1; Q3) 0.10 (0.06; 0.16) vs. 0.12 (0.08; 0.19) (ms2/mm) 2\u00d7108; P\u2009<\u20090.001] but higher stiffness [mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation (SD); 7.34\u2009\u00b1\u20091.37 vs. 6.76\u2009\u00b1\u20091.25\u2009m/s; P\u2009<\u20090.001) compared to those with non-exaggerated exercise BP. However, only lower BRS (per 1SD decrement) was associated with exaggerated exercise BP among people without hypertension at rest {specifically among those with optimal BP; odds ratio (OR) 1.16 [95% confidence intervals (95% CI) 1.01; 1.33], P\u2009=\u20090.04 and high-normal BP; OR, 1.19 (95% CI 1.07; 1.32), P\u2009=\u20090.001} after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, smoking, alcohol, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, resting heart rate, and antihypertensive medications.Impaired BRS, but not carotid stiffness, is independently associated with exaggerated exercise BP even among those with well controlled resting BP. This indicates a potential pathway from depressed neural baroreflex function to abnormal exercise BP and clinical outcomes.", "id": "29281076", "date": "2017-12-21", "title": "Impaired baroreflex sensitivity, carotid stiffness, and exaggerated exercise blood pressure: a community-based analysis from the Paris Prospective Study III.", "doi": "10.1093/eurheartj/ehx714", "journal": ["European heart journal", "Eur.
