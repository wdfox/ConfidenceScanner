Hypoglycemic agents can have both positive and negative effects on diabetic complications, which should be carefully assessed when developing personalized treatment strategies. Herein, we report that dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i), a group of widely used antihyperglycemic agents, can improve diabetic wound healing, independent of their beneficial effects on glycemic control. In particular, DPP-4i promoted the migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of keratinocytes both directly, and indirectly by inducing SDF-1\u03b1 production of fibroblasts in vitro and in diabetic mice. In addition, DPP-4i attenuated collagen synthesis and deposition, which may diminish scar formation. Furthermore, the results of a randomized clinical trial (NCT02742233) involving 67 patients with type 2 diabetes supported the role of DPP-4i treatment in diabetic wound healing. Our findings support the application of DPP-4i as a preferred option for treating diabetic patients with ulcers.", "id": "29254987", "date": "2017-12-18", "title": "DPP-4 Inhibitors Improve Diabetic Wound Healing via Direct and Indirect Promotion of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition and Reduction of Scarring.", "doi": "10.2337/db17-0934", "journal": ["Diabetes", "Diabetes"]}
