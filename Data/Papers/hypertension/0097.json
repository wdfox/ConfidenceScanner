There have been few reported cases of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome associated with active cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in renal transplant recipients. Here we present a case of active CMV viremia inducing Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome in a renal transplant recipient. We discuss the treatment regimen utilized. Furthermore, we performed a review of the literature and discuss the cases of CMV induced GBS in renal transplant recipients.", "id": "29348962", "date": "2017-11-20", "title": "Primary Cytomegalovirus Infection Causing Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome in a Living Renal Allograft Recipient.", "doi": "10.1155/2017/7264793", "journal": ["Case reports in transplantation", "Case Rep Transplant"]}
