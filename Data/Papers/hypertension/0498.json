Adiponectin levels were also linked to the relationship between BMI and cIMT (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.0371; P\u00a0=\u00a0.01). Twenty-nine individuals with increased cIMT were missed by BMI alone but detected by combining BMI and adiponectin measurements. When compared with BMI alone, the combination of adiponectin plus BMI improved the c-statistic (0.549-0.567) and the integrated discrimination improvement index (0.01725; P\u00a0=\u00a0.021). Segregation of individuals by the combined use of BMI\u00a0+\u00a0adiponectin is associated with significant differences in insulin sensitivity, glomerular filtration rate, systemic inflammatory activity, dyslipidaemia and cIMT.Combining plasma adiponectin measurements and BMI improves estimation of cIMT as compared to anthropometric parameters.", "id": "29280189", "date": "2017-12-27", "title": "Adiponectin concentration data improve the estimation of atherosclerotic risk in normal and in overweight subjects.", "doi": "10.1111/cen.13540", "journal": ["Clinical endocrinology", "Clin.
