It seems to be a consequence of obliterative portal venopathy of small hepatic veins. Its precise aetiology remains to be clearly determined. NRH was reported to occur in HIV-positive patients ten years ago. In this article, three consecutive clinical cases of HIV-related NRH were identified in a high volume reference centre of HIV positive patients and are presented. Clinical, diagnostic aspects and strategies for management of this under-diagnosed medical condition in the HIV population are also developed.", "id": "29364092", "date": null, "title": "Nodular Regenerative Hyperplasia in HIV-positive patients : a case series and review of the literature.", "doi": null, "journal": ["Acta gastro-enterologica Belgica", "Acta Gastroenterol.
