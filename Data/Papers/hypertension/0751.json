Bariatric surgery is an effective treatment of morbid obesity. Data on the effect of bariatric surgery for monogenic obesity is essentially lacking. We present the clinical and metabolic 3-year follow-up of sleeve gastrectomy in a BBS patient.A 37-year-old obese woman with BBS (body mass index, 40 kg/m2) was referred to our clinic for uncontrolled diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). After sleeve gastrectomy, progressive weight loss was observed, with a 32% total weight loss at 3-year follow-up. Glycemic control and NAFLD improved significantly. Blood pressure normalized, and treatment was discontinued 3 months after surgery.Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy can be a safe and effective treatment of morbid BBS-related obesity in adult patients. Significant and sustained weight loss leads to the improvement of several obesity-related comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, and NAFLD, as in polygenic obesity. Further data are needed to confirm the long-term efficacy and safety of bariatric surgery in BBS.", "id": "29264490", "date": "2017-03-09", "title": "Beneficial Outcomes of Sleeve Gastrectomy in a Morbidly Obese Patient With Bardet-Biedl Syndrome.", "doi": "10.1210/js.2017-00071", "journal": ["Journal of the Endocrine Society", "J Endocr Soc"]}
