Patients used regular medication therapy during the follow-up period.During the 10-year follow-up period, unfavorable outcome was recorded for 40 (32.3%) patients. Patients with unfavorable outcome had higher baseline values of left ventricular mass index (178.9 \u00b1 29.5 g/m2 vs 165.5 \u00b1 29.5 g/m2 ; P < 0.05) and QTc dispersion (64.1 \u00b1 24.7 ms vs 54.8 \u00b1 19.4 ms; P < 0.05). Frequency of positive Cornell product was higher in the group of patients with unfavorable outcome (35% vs 22.2%; P < 0.01). Positive Lyon-Sokolow score did not show statistical significance (25% vs 11.9%; P = 0.06). Cornell product (\u03b2 = 0.234; P < 0.01) and QTc dispersion >65 ms (\u03b2 = 0.184; P < 0.05) had prognostic significance in LVH (multiple regression analysis: R = 0.314, R = 0.099, adjusted R = 0.084, standard error of the estimate = 0.449, P < 0.05).Patients with a positive Cornell product and larger QTc dispersion had more unfavorable 10-year outcomes compared with other patients with LVH.", "id": "29247525", "date": "2017-12-16", "title": "QTc dispersion and Cornell duration product can predict 10-year outcomes in hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy.", "doi": "10.1002/clc.22815", "journal": ["Clinical cardiology", "Clin Cardiol"]}
