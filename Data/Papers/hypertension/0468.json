In the current study, we sought to validate the above findings and identify additional predictors of arterial versus venous thrombosis. At a median follow up of 109 months, thrombosis after diagnosis occurred in 128 (22%) patients; 82 (14%) arterial and 57 (10%) venous events. On multivariate analysis, prior arterial events (<0.0001), hyperlipidemia (p\u2009=\u20090.03), and hypertension (p\u2009=\u20090.02) predicted subsequent arterial events. In comparison, prior venous events (p\u2009=\u20090.05), leukocytosis \u226511\u2009\u00d7\u2009109/L (p\u2009=\u20090.002), and major hemorrhage (p\u2009=\u20090.02) were predictors of subsequent venous events. Salient associations with arterial thrombosis included age\u2009\u2265\u200960 years, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and normal karyotype whereas age\u2009\u2264\u200960 years, females, palpable splenomegaly and history of major hemorrhage were associated with venous thrombosis. TET2 or ASXL1 mutations did not impact arterial nor venous thrombosis. In conclusion, we identify distinct associations for arterial versus venous thrombosis in PV and confirm that a prior arterial or venous thrombotic event is the most reliable predictor of subsequent events.", "id": "29282357", "date": "2017-12-27", "title": "Risk factors for arterial versus venous thrombosis in polycythemia vera: a single center experience in 587 patients.", "doi": "10.1038/s41408-017-0035-6", "journal": ["Blood cancer journal", "Blood Cancer J"]}
