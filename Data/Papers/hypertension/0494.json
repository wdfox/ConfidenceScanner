Child population between 6-10 years old from Bucaramanga (n = 1,282). Dependent variables: hypertension, pre-hypertension, overweight/obesity, impaired glucose, insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. Main independent variable: waist-toheight ratio. The association between dependent and independent variables was evaluated using binomial regression models.9.77% of the children presented a WHtR of risk (95% CI: 8.19% to 11.52%). After adjustment for age, sex, socioeconomic status and physical activity, the WHtR of risk was significantly associated with lower HDL levels and higher levels of triglycerides, insulin resistance, hypertension and pre-hypertension (PR = 2.46 95% CI :1.70 to 3.55, p = 0.000, PR = 2.24 95% CI: 1.50 to 3.35, p = 0.000, PR = 9.39 95% CI: 5.40 to\u00a016.30, p = 0.000, PR = 8.03 95% CI: 2.01 to 32.07, p = 0.003 y PR = 2.67 95% CI: 1.60 to 4.47, p = 0.000, respectively).Children with WHtR of risk were more likely to develop high levels of blood pressure and triglycerides, insulin resistance and lower levels of HDL.", "id": "29280649", "date": "2017-11-16", "title": "Waist-to-height ratio and its relation with cardiometabolic risk factors in children from Bucaramanga, Colombia.", "doi": null, "journal": ["Nutricion hospitalaria", "Nutr Hosp"]}
