Famitinib is a small-molecule multikinase inhibitor, with promising anticancer activities. This multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase II clinical trial was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of famitinib in mCRC.Famitinib or placebo was administered orally once daily. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), overall survival (OS), quality-of-life (QoL), and safety.Between July 18, 2012 and Jan 22, 2014, a total of 167 patients were screened, and 154 patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either famitinib (n\u00a0=\u00a099) or placebo (n\u00a0=\u00a055). The median PFS was 2.8 and 1.5\u00a0months in the famitinib and placebo groups (hazard ratio\u00a0=\u00a00.60, 95% confidence interval\u00a0=\u00a00.41-0.86, P\u00a0=\u00a00.004). The DCR was 59.8% and 31.4% (P\u00a0=\u00a00.002) and the ORR was 2.2% and 0.0% (P\u00a0=\u00a00.540) in the famitinib and placebo groups, respectively. The most frequent grade 3-4 adverse events were hypertension (11.1%), hand-foot syndrome (10.1%), thrombocytopenia (10.1%), and neutropenia (9.1%). Serious adverse events occurred in 11 (11.1%) patients in the famitinib group and 5 (9.1%) in the placebo group (P\u00a0=\u00a00.788). The median OS of the famitinib and placebo groups was 7.4 and 7.2\u00a0months (P\u00a0=\u00a00.657).Famitinib prolonged PFS in refractory mCRC patients with acceptable tolerability.
