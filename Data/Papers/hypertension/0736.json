The patients had a mean age of 35.12\u00b110.7 yr with mean duration of illness of 8.3\u00b10.58 years. Seventy per cent were detected to have a comorbid physical condition. Common conditions included hypertension (21%), diabetes mellitus (15%) and anaemia (12%). Increasing age, being female, being married, longer duration of illness and longer duration of treatment were associated with higher risk of having a comorbid physical illness. Further studies need to be done with a large sample to confirm these findings.", "id": "29265031", "date": null, "title": "Physical comorbidity in schizophrenia & its correlates.", "doi": "10.4103/ijmr.IJMR_1510_15", "journal": ["The Indian journal of medical research", "Indian J.
