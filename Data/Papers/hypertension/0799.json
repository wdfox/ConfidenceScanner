This study aims to assess the prevalence of decreased GFR in a geriatric population in a developing country and its prevalence in the absence of simultaneous diseases.This is a cross-sectional study of data from the Sa\u00fade, Bem-Estar e Envelhecimento cohort study (SABE study[Health, Well-Being and Aging]), a multiple cohorts study. A multistage cluster sample composed of 1,253 individuals representative of 1,249,388 inhabitants of S\u00e3o Paulo city aged \u226560 years in 2010 was analyzed. The participants answered a survey on socio-demographic factors and health, had blood pressure measured and urine and blood samples collected. GFR was estimated and defined as decreased when <60 mL/min/1.73m2. Kidney damage was defined as dipstick-positive hematuria or urinary protein:creatinine > 0.20 g/g.The prevalence of GFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2 was 19.3%. Individuals with GFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2 were older (75\u00b11 versus 69\u00b11 years, p<0.001), had lower schooling (18 versus 30% with complete 8-year basic cycle, p = 0.010), and higher prevalence of hypertension (82 versus 63%, p<0.001), diabetes (34 versus 26%, p = 0.021), cardiovascular disease (43 versus 24%, p<0.001) and kidney damage (35% versus 15%, p<0.001). Only 0.7% of the entire studied population had GFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2 without simultaneous diseases or kidney damage. Among the individuals with GFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2, 3.5% had neither renal damage nor associated comorbidities, whereas among those with GFR \u226560 mL/min/1.73m2, 11.0% had none of these conditions. Logistic regression showed that older age, cardiovascular disease and hypertension were associated with GFR<60 mL/min/1.73m2.Decreased GFR was highly prevalent among the geriatric population in a megalopolis of a developing country. It was rarely present without simultaneous chronic comorbidities or kidney damage.", "id": "29261774", "date": "2017-12-19", "title": "Aging and decreased glomerular filtration rate: An elderly population-based study.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0189935", "journal": ["PloS one", "PLoS ONE"]}
