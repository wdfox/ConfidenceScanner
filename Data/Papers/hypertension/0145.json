We aimed to analyse effects of Aronia melanocarpa (AME) extract on blood pressure (BP), lipid peroxidation, cytokine level, total NOS activity in the left ventricle (LV), and aorta of L-NAME-induced hypertensive rats. 12-week-old male WKY rats were assigned to the control group and groups treated with AME extract (57.90\u2009mg/kg/day), L-NAME (40\u2009mg/kg/day), or combination of L-NAME (40\u2009mg/kg/day) and AME (57.90\u2009mg/kg/day) in tap water for 3 weeks. NOS activity, eNOS protein expression, and conjugated diene (CD) concentration were determined in the LV and aorta. After 3 weeks of L-NAME treatment, BP was increased by 28% and concomitant treatment with AME reduced it by 21%. NOS activity of the LV and aorta in the L-NAME group was decreased by about 40%, while AME increased it almost on the control level. AME-induced eNOS upregulation may contribute to increase NOS activity. Moreover, AME decreased CD concentration in the LV and aorta and TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 production in the plasma were increased by L-NAME treatment. In conclusion, our results showed that active substances of Aronia melanocarpa may have a positive effect on blood pressure, NOS activity, and proinflammatory processes in L-NAME-induced hypertension.", "id": "29333212", "date": "2017-11-30", "title": "Effect of Bioactive Compound of Aronia melanocarpa on Cardiovascular System in Experimental Hypertension.", "doi": "10.1155/2017/8156594", "journal": ["Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity", "Oxid Med Cell Longev"]}
