A logistic regression model was used to determine the association between hypothyroidism and the onset of those outcomes.Cohort of 1696 eligible patients for the study, with 1.8 mortality. Median age, female gender and prevalence of arterial hypertension were all significantly higher among hypothyroid patients. No differences were found in other preoperative or intraoperative characteristics. Hypothyroidism was associated with the presence of the composite outcome, RR 1.6 (1.04-2.4) and atrial fibrillation 1.9 (1.05-3.8). No association with mortality, infections or reoperation due to bleeding was found.Hypothyroidism is a disease that affects females predominantly and does not determine the presence of other comorbidities. Hypothyroidism is a risk factor for the onset of postoperative fibrillation in patients undergoing myocardial revascularization surgery. Postoperative care protocols focused on the prevention of these complications in this type of patients must be instituted.", "id": "29267609", "date": null, "title": "Hypothyroidism is a Risk Factor for Atrial Fibrillation after Coronary Artery Bypass Graft.", "doi": "10.21470/1678-9741-2017-0080", "journal": ["Brazilian journal of cardiovascular surgery", "Braz J Cardiovasc Surg"]}
