The schemes are trained on real clinical data, and their performance was assessed and found to be very satisfactory.", "id": "29266314", "date": "2017-12-20", "title": "A functional supervised learning approach to the study of blood pressure data.", "doi": "10.1002/sim.7587", "journal": ["Statistics in medicine", "Stat Med"]}
