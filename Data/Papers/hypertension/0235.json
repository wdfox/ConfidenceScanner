However, many recent studies have demonstrated that they are not reliable in various clinical settings. We thus investigated the factors influencing these echocardiographic parameters in a multicenter study.Methods\u2004and\u2004Results:The study group comprised 69 patients, referred for cardiac catheterization, and enrolled in 5 university hospitals. Time constant (\u03c4) and LV mean diastolic pressure (LVMDP) were measured using a micromanometer-tipped catheter. Although e' only weakly correlated with \u03c4 (r=-0.35, P<0.01), E/e' modestly correlated with LVMDP (r=0.48, P<0.001). Multivariable analysis revealed that hypertension (\u03b2=-0.33, P<0.01) and LV ejection fraction (LVEF) (\u03b2=0.44, P<0.001) were the independent determinants of e', and LV mass index (LVMI) (\u03b2=0.37, P<0.001) and LVMDP (\u03b2=0.47, P<0.001) were those of E/e'. Additionally, E/e' significantly correlated with LVMDP in patients with normal LVMI (r=0.74, P<0.001) but not in those with increased LVMI.The coincidence of hypertension and LVEF affected the relationship between LV relaxation and e', whereas LVMI altered the relationship between LV filling pressure and E/e'. Thus, clinical conditions associated with an increase in LVMI, such as LV hypertrophy and LV dilatation, should be considered when estimating the filling pressure from E/e'.", "id": "29311519", "date": "2017-12-29", "title": "Left Ventricular Mass Influences Relationship Between Filling Pressure and Early-Diastolic Ratio of Inflow Velocity to Mitral Annular Velocity (E/e').", "doi": "10.1253/circj.CJ-17-1019", "journal": ["Circulation journal : official journal of the Japanese Circulation Society", "Circ.
