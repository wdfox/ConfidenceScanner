Chronic kidney diseases compromise the regulatory functions, resulting in alterations in electrolyte and acid-base balance that can be life-threatening. In this review, we discuss the renal regulations of electrolyte and acid-base balance and several common disorders including metabolic acidosis, alkalosis, dysnatremia, dyskalemia, and dysmagnesemia. Common disorders in chronic kidney disease are also discussed. The most recent and relevant advances on pathophysiology, clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and management of these conditions have been incorporated.", "id": "29344508", "date": "2017-10-05", "title": "Acid-Base and Electrolyte Disorders in Patients with and without Chronic Kidney Disease: An Update.", "doi": "10.1159/000479968", "journal": ["Kidney diseases (Basel, Switzerland)", "Kidney Dis (Basel)"]}
