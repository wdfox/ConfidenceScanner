For these patients, lung transplantation remains an important therapeutic option, and recommendations for transplantation are included in the current European Society of Cardiology/European Respiratory Society guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary hypertension. Although lung transplantation is not without risk, overall long-term survival rates are good and substantial improvements in quality of life have been reported for lung transplant recipients. In this review, we describe the important considerations prior to, during and after transplantation, including the role of mechanical support, in patients with advanced PAH.", "id": "29263172", "date": "2017-12-20", "title": "Advanced pulmonary arterial hypertension: mechanical support and lung transplantation.", "doi": "10.1183/16000617.0089-2017", "journal": ["European respiratory review : an official journal of the European Respiratory Society", "Eur Respir Rev"]}
