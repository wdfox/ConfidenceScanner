Although three pathogenic pathways have been relatively well characterised, it is widely accepted that dysfunction in a multitude of other cellular processes is likely to play a critical role in driving the development of PAH. Currently available therapies, which all target one of the three well-characterised pathways, provide significant benefits for patients; however, PAH remains a progressive and ultimately fatal disease. The development of drugs to target alternative pathogenic pathways is, therefore, an attractive proposition and one that may complement existing treatment regimens to improve outcomes for patients. Considerable research has been undertaken to identify the role of the less well-understood pathways and in this review we will highlight some of the key discoveries and the potential for utility as therapeutic targets.", "id": "29263173", "date": "2017-12-20", "title": "Pathobiology of pulmonary arterial hypertension: understanding the roads less travelled.", "doi": "10.1183/16000617.0093-2017", "journal": ["European respiratory review : an official journal of the European Respiratory Society", "Eur Respir Rev"]}
