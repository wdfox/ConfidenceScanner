We analyzed risk factors for 1-year acute rejection (AR) and 5-year death-censored graft loss (DCGL) and patient death. Compared with the reference, basiliximab: (1) one-year AR risk was lower with ATG in retransplant recipients of expanded criteria deceased-donor kidneys (HR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.35-0.91 and HR = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.27-1.08, resp.), while AR risk was lower with alemtuzumab in retransplant recipients with >3 HLA mismatches before transplant (HR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.44-0.93 and HR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.63-1.06, resp.); (2) five-year DCGL risk was lower with alemtuzumab, not ATG, in retransplant recipients of African American race (HR = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.34-0.86 and HR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.51-1.04, resp.) or with pretransplant glomerulonephritis (HR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.43-0.98 and HR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.60-1.12, resp.). Therefore, specific risk factor-induction regimen combinations may predict outcomes and this information may help in individualizing induction in retransplant recipients.", "id": "29312783", "date": "2017-09-24", "title": "Analysis of Risk Factors for Kidney Retransplant Outcomes Associated with Common Induction Regimens: A Study of over Twelve-Thousand Cases in the United States.", "doi": "10.1155/2017/8132672", "journal": ["Journal of transplantation", "J Transplant"]}
