Six calves (age: 6-9 months old; weight: 114-310 kg) were anesthetized with intravenous alfaxalone 15 min after administration of intramuscular saline (0.5 ml/100 kg) or xylazine (0.1 mg/kg; 0.5 ml/100 kg of a 2% xylazine solution). Anesthesia induction was smooth and orotracheal intubation was achieved in all calves. The calves anesthetized with xylazine-alfaxalone required a smaller induction dose of alfaxalone (1.23 \u00b1 0.17 mg/kg, P=0.010) and accepted endotracheal intubation for a significantly longer period (16.8 \u00b1 7.2 min, P=0.022) than the calves anesthetized with alfaxalone alone (2.28 \u00b1 0.65 mg/kg 7.3 \u00b1 1.6 min). At 5 min after induction, tachycardia (heart rate: 166 \u00b1 47 beats/min of heart rate), hypertension (mean arterial blood pressure: 147 \u00b1 81 mmHg), and hypoxemia (partial pressure of arterial blood oxygen [PaO2]: 43 \u00b1 10 mmHg) were observed in the calves anesthetized with alfaxalone alone, whereas hypoxemia (PaO2: 47 \u00b1 7 mmHg) and mild hypercapnia (partial pressure of arterial blood carbon dioxide: 54 \u00b1 5 mmHg) were observed in the calves anesthetized with xylazine-alfaxalone. Premedication with xylazine provided a sparing effect on the induction dose of alfaxalone and a prolongation of anesthetic effect. Oxygen supplementation should be considered to prevent hypoxemia during anesthesia.", "id": "29269688", "date": "2017-12-20", "title": "Anesthetic and cardiorespiratory effects of single-bolus intravenous alfaxalone with or without intramuscular xylazine-premedication in calves.", "doi": "10.1292/jvms.17-0512", "journal": ["The Journal of veterinary medical science", "J.
