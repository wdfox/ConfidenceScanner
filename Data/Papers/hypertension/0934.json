While polyethylenimine (PEI) has previously been shown to be an effective vehicle for vascular lung-directed delivery of plasmid DNA, it remains unclear whether this utility is generalizable to miRNAs. Here we show that despite elevated lung levels, the intravenous infusion of PEI-miRNA mimic complexes fails to provide lung-selective delivery in rats.", "id": "29251557", "date": "2017-12-18", "title": "Systemic delivery of MicroRNA mimics with polyethylenimine elevates pulmonary microRNA levels, but lacks pulmonary selectivity.", "doi": "10.1177/2045893217750613", "journal": ["Pulmonary circulation", "Pulm Circ"]}
