LCAT enzyme esterifies cholesterol molecules in high-density lipoprotein(HDL) and low density-lipoprotein (LDL) particles. This enzyme deficiency is characterised by progressive corneal opacification, glomerulopathy, mild - moderate haemolytic anaemia and very low plasma levels of HDL. We here report a 34 year-old lady who presented with hypertension, nephrotic proteinuria, renal failure, corneal ring opacities, anemia and dyslipidemia. The diagnosis of familial LCAT deficiency was confirmed by clinical examination, characteristic dyslipidemia, undetectable LCAT levels in plasma and positive family history.", "id": "29319258", "date": null, "title": "Familial Lecithin Cholesterol Acyl Transferase Deficiency with Chronic Kidney Disease.", "doi": null, "journal": ["The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India", "J Assoc Physicians India"]}
