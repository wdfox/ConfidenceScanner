In this qualitative study, we explore how outpatients with CKD Stages 1-5 (without renal replacement therapy) and their family members experienced an individually tailored CKD counseling service led by an advanced practice nurse (APN). Using thematic analysis, 10 pair interviews (N = 20) were conducted and analyzed stepwise. Findings revealed iterative processes along the course of the disease. Participants struggled with an incomprehensible diagnosis. An APN assisted them in their efforts to master CKD. The APN offered information, insights, and understanding. This support helped the families achieve a new outlook and filled some gaps in CKD care. Future development of the service should focus on slowing down CKD progression more effectively. Healthcare providers are encouraged to acknowledge the importance of ongoing guidance and the continuity of care in treating patients with CKD.", "id": "29281775", "date": null, "title": "Experiences of Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease and Their Family Members in an Advanced Practice Nurse-Led Counseling Service.", "doi": null, "journal": ["Nephrology nursing journal : journal of the American Nephrology Nurses' Association", "Nephrol Nurs J"]}
