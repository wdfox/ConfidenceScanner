The aim of the present study is to investigate associations between thyroid profile and the pro-thrombotic mediator, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), in MetS and identify associated biochemical markers. Materials and methods The present study was a case control study and consisted of 50 diagnosed cases of MetS and 50 healthy volunteers as controls. MetS cases were further divided into two groups based on the presence and absence of subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH). Data collected included demographic profile, clinical history and routine lab investigation. Special investigations included the thyroid function test and serum PAI-1 levels. Results The mean serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were significantly higher in MetS cases as compared to controls (5.7\u2009\u00b1\u20091.2 mIU/L vs. 2.3\u2009\u00b1\u20091.6 mIU/L, p\u2009<\u20090.0001), although the mean triiodothyronine (T3) and\u00a0thyroxine (T4) levels were comparable in two groups. The mean levels of serum PAI-1 were significantly higher in MetS cases as compared to controls(231\u2009\u00b1\u200987 ng/mL vs. 185\u2009\u00b1\u200996 ng/mL, p\u2009=\u20090.013). TSH and PAI-1 levels were positively correlated with various markers of MetS and negatively correlated with high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Conclusion The present study points towards the presence of thyroid dysfunction, in the form of subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH), in cases of MetS. In the presence of thyroid dysfunction, abnormal adipocytes may release adipokines, such as PAI-1, which lead to increased risk of thrombotic episodes in these patients. Hence, SCH should be appropriately managed.", "id": "29261514", "date": "2017-12-20", "title": "Association of prothrombotic adipokine (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1) with TSH in metabolic syndrome: a case control study.", "doi": "10.1515/hmbci-2017-0046", "journal": ["Hormone molecular biology and clinical investigation", "Horm Mol Biol Clin Investig"]}
