Perioperative outcome, reoperation rate, aortic valve function, and long-term survival were evaluated.The median age of the entire cohort was 56 years. Rates of malperfusion (21%), shock (16%), history of renal failure (4%), and extent of surgery were similar between David and Bentall groups. However, the David group was significantly younger (45 versus 61 years) with less hypertension (45% versus 66%), coronary artery disease (0% versus 17%), valvulopathy (5% versus 19%), and prior cardiac surgery (5% versus 21%). Overall operative mortality was 9.6% (David 3% and Bentall 13%). Composite outcome comprising myocardial infarction, stroke, new-onset renal failure, and operative mortality was 18% in the entire cohort (David 5% and Bentall 23%). In the David group, the freedom of moderate aortic insufficiency was 95% at 10 years. The rate of reoperation for pathology of the proximal aorta or aortic valve was 0% and 2% for the David and Bentall groups, respectively. Ten-year Kaplan-Meier survival was 66% (95% confidence interval: 51% to 77%) for the entire cohort, with 98% (95% confidence interval: 84% to 99%) survival in the David group and 57% (95% confidence interval: 42% to 70%) survival in the Bentall group.Both the David and Bentall procedures are appropriate surgical approaches for aortic root replacement in select patients with an acute type A aortic dissection.", "id": "29258677", "date": "2017-12-16", "title": "Sixteen-Year Experience of David and Bentall Procedures in Acute Type A Aortic Dissection.", "doi": "10.1016/j.athoracsur.2017.09.029", "journal": ["The Annals of thoracic surgery", "Ann.
