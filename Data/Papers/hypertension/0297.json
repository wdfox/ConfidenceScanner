ERCP combines both endoscopic and radiologic imaging. Despite the fact that it is widely considered as relatively safe and useful procedure when performed by an experienced endoscopist, ERCP may potentially result in complications due to its invasive nature. These complications vary in severity and include post-ERCP pancreatitis, cholangitis, hemorrhage and perforations of the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, the selection of patients and their appropriate preparation before the procedure as well as the careful consideration of indications are highly required.", "id": "29298967", "date": null, "title": "[Complications of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography].", "doi": null, "journal": ["Polski merkuriusz lekarski : organ Polskiego Towarzystwa Lekarskiego", "Pol.
