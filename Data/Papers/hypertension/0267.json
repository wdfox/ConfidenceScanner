For each patient, we scored the severity of WML and PV (periventricular) WML using the Fazekas score and using the ARWMC scale for WML and BG (basal ganglia) and clinical characteristics such as neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and cognitive function.204 PD patients were included of whom n\u202f=\u202f53 (26.0%) had neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH). The presence of nOH was significantly associated with the severity of WML as defined by the Fazekas score and the ARWMC scale. An ordinal regression model confirmed this association with an OR of 0.41 (95% CI 0.18-0.92: p\u202f=\u202f.03) and an OR of 0.39 (95% CI 0.17-0.88: p\u202f=\u202f.02). There were no significant associations between WML and other co-variables, including hypertension, dopaminergic medication use, Hoehn and Yahr stage, gender and cognitive decline.The presence of nOH is associated with WML severity in PD patients.", "id": "29306636", "date": "2017-12-27", "title": "Clinical correlates of cerebral white matter abnormalities in patients with Parkinson's disease.", "doi": "10.1016/j.parkreldis.2017.12.029", "journal": ["Parkinsonism & related disorders", "Parkinsonism Relat.
