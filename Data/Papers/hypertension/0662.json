A 66-year-old man with kyphosis who had been treated with nocturnal noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation developed PH with a mean pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) of 32 mmHg and a pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) of 5.95 Wood units. After addition of oxygen therapy and tadalafil, his condition improved. One year later, his mean PAP and PVR were 25 mmHg and 3.62 Wood units, respectively. This case shows the therapeutic potential of vasoactive medications for alveolar hypoventilation-related PH.", "id": "29269646", "date": "2017-12-21", "title": "Pulmonary Hypertension and Its Response to Treatment in a Patient With Kyphosis-related Alveolar Hypoventilation.", "doi": "10.2169/internalmedicine.9244-17", "journal": ["Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)", "Intern.
