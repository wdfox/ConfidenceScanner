Malignant refractory ascites usually heralds a poor prognosis and substantially impairs the quality of life of patients because of the symptoms experienced and the need for repeated paracentesis. EUS-guided placement of lumen-apposing, fully covered, self-expandable metal stents (FCSEMS) has been reported for the drainage of malignant ascites. Herein, we present the results of EUS-guided placement of plastic pigtails stents for the drainage of refractory malignant ascites in three patients. The aim was to improve symptoms and minimize the possible drawbacks of large-caliber FCSEMS.\u200aIn this preliminary experience, EUS-guided placement of plastic stents was feasible and avoided further paracentesis.", "id": "29250586", "date": "2017-10-27", "title": "Endoscopic ultrasound-guided placement of plastic pigtail stents for the drainage of refractory malignant ascites.", "doi": "10.1055/s-0043-118746", "journal": ["Endoscopy international open", "Endosc Int Open"]}
