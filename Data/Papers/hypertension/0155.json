The aim of this study was to examine the association of regular or decaffeinated coffee consumption with the risk of developing hypertension in a middle-aged Mediterranean cohort.The SUN Project is a prospective open cohort with more than 22,500 Spanish university graduates. For the present study, we analyzed data from 13,374 participants initially free of hypertension (mean follow-up 9.1 years). The consumption of regular and decaffeinated coffee was obtained at baseline using a previously validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Validated, self-reported medical diagnoses of hypertension were collected biennially. We used Cox regression models to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for incident hypertension according to baseline coffee consumption. We assessed the interaction with sex and baseline adherence to the Mediterranean diet.Among 121,397 person-years of follow-up, a total of 1757 participants developed hypertension. Overall, coffee consumption -either caffeinated or decaffeinated- was not significantly associated with the risk of hypertension. Only among women, higher consumption of regular coffee was associated with a 26% lower risk of hypertension (>=2 cups/d vs. never/seldom, 95% CI 9%-39%; p for interaction: 0.0236). Women with a low baseline adherence to the Mediterranean diet showed the strongest risk reduction (HR\u00a0\u2265\u00a02 cups/d vs. never/seldom 0.58, 95% CI (0.41-0.82) p for interaction\u00a0=\u00a00.0452).In the SUN project we found an inverse association between regular coffee consumption and the risk of hypertension in women, which was strongest among women with a suboptimal food pattern (low adherence to the Mediterranean diet).", "id": "29331442", "date": "2017-12-21", "title": "Coffee consumption and risk of hypertension in the SUN Project.", "doi": "10.1016/j.clnu.2017.12.009", "journal": ["Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)", "Clin Nutr"]}
