Smoking and hypertension are the 2 major risk factors for AAA crucial in preventing its progression. The underlying fundamental pathophysiological cause of AAA is chronic inflammation. Large AAA with a risk of rupture is usually treated by graft replacement or endovascular aneurysm repair. Nonsurgical treatment is not an alternative for large AAA, but is potentially beneficial for small AAA which usually requires a watchful waiting approach with medication. Herein, we introduce current clinical research regarding the pharmacological treatment of small AAA and assess the optimal time for starting the treatment.", "id": "29284387", "date": "2017-12-27", "title": "Optimal time for pharmacological treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm.", "doi": "10.2174/1389450119666171227225008", "journal": ["Current drug targets", "Curr Drug Targets"]}
