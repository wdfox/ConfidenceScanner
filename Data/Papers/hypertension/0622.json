Different antireflux approaches were advocated with differences in morbidity and success. The aim of this study is to review and analyze the surgical outcomes of pneumovesicoscopic ureteral reimplantation and endoscopic injection of dextranomer/hyaluronic acid (Dx/HA) in three tertiary centers.The medical records of 215 patients (159 boys and 56 girls) for a total of 323 ureters underwent surgical interventions for primary VUR from February 2002 to August 2014 were reviewed. Data on baseline demographics, preoperative symptoms, radiological imaging studies, and postoperative outcomes were analyzed. VUR resolution was defined as when no VUR was detected by micturating cystourethrogram at 3 months or later after the intervention. Independent t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, Fisher's Exact test, and Chi-Square test were used for different parameters. All results with P value \u2264.05 were regarded as statistically significant.The mean age at operation was 3.33 and 4.63 for reimplantation and Dx/HA injection respectively. A total of 234 ureters underwent Dx/HA injection and 92 ureters underwent pneumovesicoscopic ureteral reimplantation with mean preoperative VUR grading of 3.1 and 4.2 respectively (P\u2009=\u2009.0001). The overall VUR downgrading and resolution rates were both significantly higher in reimplantation than Dx/HA injection (97.8% versus 78.6% P\u2009=\u2009.0001 and 84.3% versus 65% P\u2009=\u2009.0011). Further subgroup analyses across the different VUR gradings showed higher downgrading and resolution rates in reimplantation group than Dx/HA injection for grade 4 (100% versus 81% P\u2009=\u2009.0147 and 82.4% versus 63% P\u2009=\u2009.0411) and grade 5 VUR (97.3% versus 50% P\u2009=\u2009.0022 and 81.6% versus 40% P\u2009=\u2009.0256). Dx/HA injection was associated with shorter operation time (41.5 minutes versus 147.5 minutes, P\u2009<\u2009.001), less postoperative analgesic usage (P\u2009=\u2009.049), and shorter hospital stay (1.06 days versus 4.44 days P\u2009<\u2009.0001). No major complications were identified in both groups. The mean follow-up time was significantly longer in reimplantation group than Dx/HA group (57.25 months versus 37.85 months, P\u2009=\u2009.002). There was no significant difference in the rate of subsequent UTI development during follow-up (P\u2009=\u2009.8).Both Dx/HA injection and pneumovesicoscopic ureteral reimplantation are safe and effective treatments for VUR. Reimplantation is associated with significantly higher VUR downgrading and resolution rates than Dx/HA injection especially in the higher grade VUR while Dx/HA injection has significantly shorter operation time, lower postoperative analgesic usage, and shorter hospital stay. Dx/HA injection can be considered as the first line surgical treatment especially for lower grade VUR. Pneumovesicoscopic ureteral reimplantation can be used for higher grade reflux or those who failed Dx/HA treatments.", "id": "29271690", "date": "2017-12-22", "title": "Surgical Outcome Analysis of Pneumovesicoscopic Ureteral Reimplantation and Endoscopic Dextranomer/Hyaluronic Acid Injection for Primary Vesicoureteral Reflux in Children: A Multicenter 12-Year Review.", "doi": "10.1089/lap.2017.0281", "journal": ["Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.
