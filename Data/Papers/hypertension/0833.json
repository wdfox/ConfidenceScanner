Electronic address: raslana@ohsu.edu."]], "text": "Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is characterized by headaches, visual obscurations, and papilledema, while diagnosis involves lumbar puncture (LP) with an elevated opening pressure (OP) \u2265 20cm H20. When papilledema is absent, diagnosis becomes less clear. Some physicians have argued that absence of papilledema rules out IIH, while others maintain that elevated OP is sufficient for diagnosis.The authors performed a single institution 4-year retrospective analysis of patients who underwent invasive intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring for presumed IIH.A total of 22 patients were reviewed and 13 had classic symptoms of IIH, documented elevated OP and absence of papilledema, 5/13 (38%) patients had proven intracranial hypertension using invasive ICP monitoring, while 8/13 (62%) had normal ICP.Using current diagnostic algorithms of clinical presentation and elevated OP, over half of patients without papilledema in our series would be falsely diagnosed with IIH, which could result in unnecessary medical and surgical intervention. Thus, elevated OP as determined by LP is insufficient to diagnosis IIH. On the other hand, the absence of papilledema does not rule out intracranial hypertension.", "id": "29258930", "date": "2017-12-16", "title": "Utility of intracranial pressure monitoring for diagnosis of Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension in the absence of papilledema.", "doi": "10.1016/j.wneu.2017.12.036", "journal": ["World neurosurgery", "World Neurosurg"]}
