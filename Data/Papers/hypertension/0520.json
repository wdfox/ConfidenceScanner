However, there have been few studies to support a causal link between UA, metabolic syndrome (MetS), diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HTN) in young subjects.From the Health Examination Registration System of Taiwanese military service during the period 2013-2015, there were 46,561 eligible participants who were 20years old or older in our study. Different analytical steps of analysis were performed to examine the association between UA and cardiometabolic risk using logistic regression, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and Cox regression.For total population, serum UA had significant associations with the presence of MetS (OR=2.08, 95% CI=1.51-2.87), DM (OR=2.59, 95% CI=1.09-6.19) and HTN (OR=1.49, 95% CI=1.07-2.07) in the cross-sectional analysis. According to the cut-off values of UA calculating by the ROC curve analysis in each sex/age subgroup, the association between UA and incident adverse outcomes were analyzed in a longitudinal study. In male, higher UA significantly increased the risks for developing MetS in 30-40years (HR=1.12, 95% CI=1.01-1.25), DM in <30years (HR=2.75, 95% CI=1.38-5.45) and HTN in all subgroups (HR=1.17, 95% CI=1.01-1.37; HR=1.65, 95% CI=1.08-2.53; HR=1.72, 95% CI=1.22-2.43). In females, a higher UA was significantly associated with an increased risk of incident MetS in >40years (HR=2.99, 95% CI=1.34-6.64), HTN in >40years (HR=2.58, 95% CI=1.02-6.55), and no increased risk of DM.Our study concluded that serum UA is an important predictor for the risk of incident MetS, DM, and HTN in adults, especially in male population.", "id": "29278722", "date": "2017-12-24", "title": "The association of uric acid with the risk of metabolic syndrome, arterial hypertension or diabetes in young subjects- An observational study.", "doi": "10.1016/j.cca.2017.12.038", "journal": ["Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry", "Clin.
