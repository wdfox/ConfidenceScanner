Sociodemographic details, blood pressure, diabetes, visual impairment, and other reported diagnosed morbidities were assessed by interview using structured pro forma. Functional limitations for activities of daily living were assessed by 10-item Barthel index scale.Overall prevalence of any morbidity was 89.2% (149/167) and moderate or severe functional limitation was 9% (15/167). One morbidity was reported by 34.1% (57), two morbidities 24% (40), three or more 31.1% (52) of the participants. Most common morbidities include hypertension (63, 37.7%), diabetes and visual impairment (61, 36.5% in each), joint pains or backache (51, 30.5%). Age group was significantly associated with joint pain/backache and visual impairment while gender with diabetes, hypertension, and chest diseases. Higher functional limitation is significantly more among those with joint pain or backache (P < 0.05). Among those with moderate and severe functional limitation, majority (12, 80%) had \u22653 morbidities.The reported morbidities are high, but moderate or severe functional limitation is more common among those with joint pain or backache and \u22653 morbidities.", "id": "29302537", "date": null, "title": "Morbidity pattern and its relation to functional limitations among old age rural population in Kerala, India.", "doi": "10.4103/2249-4863.220015", "journal": ["Journal of family medicine and primary care", "J Family Med Prim Care"]}
