Methods: 176 cases of stillbirth were collected in the Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital of Fudan University from January 1(st), 2010 to December 31(st), 2016. All cases were analyzed retrospectively, including general profile, high risk factors of stillbirth in different years and pregnancy periods. Results: (1) The incidence of stillbirth was 0.178%(176/98 785). Stillbirth occured mostly at 28-28(+6) gestational weeks (10.8%,19/176), and the second peak was 29-29(+6) weeks(10.2%,18/176), while the third common period was 37-37(+6) weeks (9.1%,16/176). After 39 weeks, it maintained at a low level. (2) The top 5 high risk factors of stillbirth were infection (18.2%,32/176), unexplained (13.6%,24/176), hypertention disorders in pregnancy (13.1%, 23/176), umbilical cord torsion (12.5%, 22/176) and fetal malformations (10.2%, 18/176). (3) From 2010 to 2012, the top 3 high risk factors were unexplained, the umbilical cord torsion and infection, while hypertention in pregnancy, infection and fetal malformation became the top 3 high risk factors after 2013. (4) Early stillbirth (20-27(+6) weeks) accounted for 21.6%(38/176); and unexplained (47.4%, 18/38), fetal edema (13.2%, 5/38),infection (13.2%, 5/38), umbilical cord torsion (5.3%, 2/38) were the top 4 high risk factors. Late stillbirth (\u226528 weeks) accounted for 78.4%(138/176), with infection (19.6%,27/138), hypertention in pregnancy (15.9%,22/138), umbilical cord torsion (14.5%,20/138) and fetal malformation(12.3%,17/138)being the top 4 high risk factors. Conclusions: More attention should be paid to maternal complications, especially infection and hypertension in pregnancy. Antenatal fetal monitoring, timely termination of pregnancy, standard management of stillbirth and looking for the causes may help reduce the incidence of stillbirth.\u76ee\u7684\uff1a \u63a2\u8ba8\u6b7b\u80ce\u7684\u9ad8\u5371\u56e0\u7d20\u3002 \u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a \u6536\u96c62010\u5e741\u67081\u65e5\u81f32016\u5e7412\u670831\u65e5\u4e8e\u590d\u65e6\u5927\u5b66\u9644\u5c5e\u5987\u4ea7\u79d1\u533b\u9662\u4f4f\u9662\u5206\u5a29\u7684\u6b7b\u80ce176\u4f8b\uff0c\u56de\u987e\u6027\u5206\u6790\u5176\u4e00\u822c\u60c5\u51b5\u3001\u9ad8\u5371\u56e0\u7d20\u3001\u4e0d\u540c\u5e74\u4efd\u53ca\u598a\u5a20\u65f6\u671f\u6b7b\u80ce\u7684\u9ad8\u5371\u56e0\u7d20\u3002 \u7ed3\u679c\uff1a \uff081\uff09\u6b7b\u80ce\u7684\u603b\u4f53\u53d1\u751f\u7387\u4e3a0.178%\uff08176/98 785\uff09\uff0c\u5b55\u671f\u4e2d\u6b7b\u80ce\u53d1\u751f\u7684\u6700\u9ad8\u5cf0\u65f6\u671f\u4e3a\u5b5528~28\u5468(+6)\uff0810.8%\uff0c19/176\uff09\uff0c\u7b2c2\u4e2a\u9ad8\u5cf0\u65f6\u671f\u4e3a\u5b5529~29\u5468(+6)\uff0810.2%\uff0c18/176\uff09\uff0c\u7b2c3\u4e2a\u9ad8\u5cf0\u65f6\u671f\u4e3a\u5b5537~37\u5468(+6)\uff089.1%\uff0c16/176\uff09\uff0c\u5b5539\u5468\u540e\u7ef4\u6301\u5728\u8f83\u4f4e\u6c34\u5e73\u3002\uff082\uff09\u5bfc\u81f4\u6b7b\u80ce\u7684\u524d5\u4f4d\u9ad8\u5371\u56e0\u7d20\u4f9d\u6b21\u4e3a\uff1a\u6bcd\u4f53\u611f\u67d3\uff0818.2%\uff0c32/176\uff09\u3001\u539f\u56e0\u4e0d\u660e\uff0813.6%\uff0c24/176\uff09\u3001\u598a\u5a20\u671f\u9ad8\u8840\u538b\u75be\u75c5\uff0813.1%\uff0c23/176\uff09\u3001\u8110\u5e26\u626d\u8f6c\uff0812.5%\uff0c22/176\uff09\u3001\u80ce\u513f\u7ed3\u6784\u5f02\u5e38\uff0810.2%\uff0c18/176\uff09\u3002\uff083\uff092010\u81f32012\u5e74\uff0c\u539f\u56e0\u4e0d\u660e\u3001\u8110\u5e26\u626d\u8f6c\u3001\u611f\u67d3\u662f\u5bfc\u81f4\u6b7b\u80ce\u7684\u524d3\u4f4d\u9ad8\u5371\u56e0\u7d20\uff1b2013\u5e74\u8d77\uff0c\u598a\u5a20\u671f\u9ad8\u8840\u538b\u75be\u75c5\u3001\u611f\u67d3\u548c\u80ce\u513f\u7ed3\u6784\u5f02\u5e38\u4e3a\u524d3\u4f4d\u9ad8\u5371\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\uff084\uff09\u65e9\u671f\uff08\u5b5520~27\u5468(+6)\uff09\u6b7b\u80ce\u536021.6%\uff0838/176\uff09\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u539f\u56e0\u4e0d\u660e\uff0847.4%\uff0c18/38\uff09\u3001\u80ce\u513f\u6c34\u80bf\uff0813.2%\uff0c5/38\uff09\u3001\u6bcd\u4f53\u611f\u67d3\uff0813.2%\uff0c5/38\uff09\u548c\u8110\u5e26\u626d\u8f6c\uff085.3%\uff0c2/38\uff09\u4e3a\u524d4\u4f4d\u9ad8\u5371\u56e0\u7d20\uff1b\u665a\u671f\uff08\u5b55\u226528\u5468\uff09\u6b7b\u80ce\u536078.4%\uff08138/176\uff09\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6bcd\u4f53\u611f\u67d3\uff0819.6%\uff0c27/138\uff09\u3001\u598a\u5a20\u671f\u9ad8\u8840\u538b\u75be\u75c5\uff0815.9%\uff0c22/138\uff09\u3001\u8110\u5e26\u626d\u8f6c\uff0814.5%\uff0c20/138\uff09\u548c\u80ce\u513f\u7ed3\u6784\u5f02\u5e38\uff0812.3%\uff0c17/138\uff09\u4e3a\u524d4\u4f4d\u9ad8\u5371\u56e0\u7d20\u3002 \u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a \u91cd\u89c6\u6bcd\u4f53\u598a\u5a20\u671f\u5e76\u53d1\u75c7\u548c\u5408\u5e76\u75c7\u7684\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u611f\u67d3\u548c\u598a\u5a20\u671f\u9ad8\u8840\u538b\u75be\u75c5\uff1b\u52a0\u5f3a\u4ea7\u524d\u80ce\u513f\u76d1\u62a4\uff0c\u9002\u65f6\u7ec8\u6b62\u598a\u5a20\uff1b\u89c4\u8303\u6b7b\u80ce\u7684\u5904\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u79ef\u6781\u5bfb\u627e\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5371\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5747\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u964d\u4f4e\u6b7b\u80ce\u7684\u53d1\u751f\u7387\u3002.", "id": "29325264", "date": null, "title": "[High risk factors analysis of stillbirth].", "doi": null, "journal": ["Zhonghua fu chan ke za zhi", "Zhonghua Fu Chan Ke Za Zhi"]}
