We evaluated a pacemaker-based Programmable Hypertension Control (PHC) therapy that uses a sequence of variably timed shorter and longer atrioventricular intervals.Patients indicated for dual-chamber pacing with office systolic blood pressure (oSBP) >150\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg despite stable medical therapy were implanted with a Moderato\u2122 pulse generator that delivers PHC therapy. Patients were followed for 1\u00a0month (Run-In period) with conventional pacing; those with persistent oSBP >140\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg were included in the study and had PHC therapy activated. The co-primary efficacy end points were changes in 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure and oSBP between baseline and 3\u00a0months. Safety was assessed by tracking adverse events. Thirty-five patients met the initial inclusion criteria and underwent Moderato implantation. At 1\u00a0month, oSBP was <140\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg in 7 patients who were excluded. PHC was activated in the remaining 27 patients with baseline office blood pressure 166\u00b111/80\u00b110\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg despite an average of 3.2 antihypertensive medications. During the Run-In period, oSBP and 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure decreased by 8\u00b113 and 5\u00b112\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg (P<0.002), respectively. Compared with pre-PHC activation measurements, oSBP decreased by another 16\u00b115\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg and 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure decreased by an additional 10\u00b113\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg (both P<0.01) at 3\u00a0months. No device-related serious adverse effects were noted.In pacemaker patients with persistent hypertension despite medical therapy, oSBP and 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure are decreased by PHC therapy. Initial indications are that this therapy is a safe and promising therapy for such patients.URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.
