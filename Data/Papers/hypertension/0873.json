It remains to be investigated which patient groups can potentially benefit from RDN. The present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of RDN in patients with mild-moderate resistant hypertension, i.\u2009e., systolic office blood pressure (BP) of 140-160\u2009mm\u2009Hg despite treatment with three antihypertensive drugs including one diuretic, or mean systolic BP by ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) of 135-150\u2009mm\u2009Hg.We evaluated data from four relevant clinical studies, all conducted in Europe, comprising 185 eligible patients. The patients' age was 62.1\u00a0\u00b1 10.3\u00a0years and 73% were male (RDN group n\u00a0= 149, control group n\u00a0= 36).A\u00a0self-control comparison showed that RDN led to significantly reduced ABPM at the 6\u2011month follow-up (systolic ABPM: 147.3\u00a0\u00b1 13.4\u2009mm\u2009Hg vs. 136.9\u00a0\u00b1 15.5\u2009mm\u2009Hg; diastolic ABPM: 81.1\u00a0\u00b1 9.6\u2009mm\u2009Hg vs. 76.2\u00a0\u00b1 9.7\u2009mm\u2009Hg; p\u00a0< 0.001). RDN was associated with a\u00a0greater improvement in ABPM as compared with that in the control group (\u2206systolic-ABPM: -10.4\u00a0\u00b1 9.4 vs. -3.5\u00a0\u00b1 9.6\u2009mm\u2009Hg, p\u00a0< 0.001; \u2206diastolic-ABPM: -5\u00a0\u00b1 5.8 vs. -2.1\u00a0\u00b1 5.5\u2009mm\u2009Hg; p\u00a0= 0.005, respectively). The decrease of office BP in the RDN group was also statistically significant. RDN led to a\u00a0reduced number of antihypertensive medications. No severe adverse events were found during follow-up. Regression analysis showed that the available baseline characteristics did not correlate with the ABPM improvement after RDN.RDN appears to be a\u00a0safe and effective intervention for patients with mild-moderate resistant hypertension; however, randomized studies are warranted.", "id": "29255910", "date": "2017-12-18", "title": "Renal denervation for mild-moderate treatment-resistant hypertension : A\u00a0timely intervention?", "doi": "10.1007/s00059-017-4664-0", "journal": ["Herz", "Herz"]}
