An 81-year-old man with medical history of hypertension and ischemic stroke presented with dizziness, nausea, and mild dysarthria. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed acute infarcts in the left internal carotid artery territory. CT angiogram revealed a persistent trigeminal artery (PTA) and severe atherosclerosis. The patient developed new neurological symptoms and repeat imaging revealed new acute infarcts in the PTA distribution. After undergoing a left carotid endarterectomy with no complications, the patient was discharged to a skilled nursing facility with no recurrence of ischemic stroke. This case adds a rare complication of an infrequent vascular anomaly to the limited body of the literature.", "id": "29348950", "date": "2017-12-04", "title": "Carotid Endarterectomy in a Patient with Severe Internal Carotid Artery Stenosis with Persistent Trigeminal Artery and Ischemia of the Anterior and Posterior Circulation.", "doi": "10.1155/2017/7193734", "journal": ["Case reports in neurological medicine", "Case Rep Neurol Med"]}
