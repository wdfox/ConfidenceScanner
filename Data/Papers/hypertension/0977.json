However, the cause and mechanisms of myocardial fibrosis are unclear.Eighty-three asymptomatic triathletes undergoing >10 training h per week (43 \u00b1 10 years of age; 65%\u00a0male) and 36 sedentary controls were studied by using LGE and extracellular volume (ECV) CMR. Parameters of physical fitness were measured by spiroergometry. Triathletes reported their lifetime competition results.LGE CMR revealed focal nonischemic myocardial fibrosis in 9 of 54 (17%) male triathletes (LGE+) but in none of the female triathletes (p\u00a0< 0.05). LGE+ triathletes had higher peak exercise systolic blood pressure (213 \u00b1 24 mm\u00a0Hg) than LGE- triathletes (194 \u00b1 26 mm\u00a0Hg; p\u00a0< 0.05). Furthermore, left ventricular mass index was higher in LGE+ triathletes\u00a0(93 \u00b1 7 g/m2) than in LGE- triathletes (84 \u00b1 11 g/m2; p < 0.05). ECV in LGE- myocardium was\u00a0higher in LGE+ triathletes (26.3 \u00b1 1.8%) than in LGE- triathletes (24.4 \u00b1 2.2%; p\u00a0< 0.05). LGE+ triathletes completed longer cumulative\u00a0distances in swimming and cycling races and participated more often in middle and Iron Man distances than LGE- triathletes. A cycling race distance of >1,880 km completed during competition had the highest accuracy to predict\u00a0LGE, with an area under the curve value of 0.876 (p\u00a0< 0.0001), resulting in high sensitivity (89%) and specificity (79%). Multivariate analysis identified peak exercise systolic blood\u00a0pressure (p\u00a0< 0.05) and the swimming race distance (p\u00a0< 0.01) as independent predictors of LGE presence.Myocardial fibrosis in asymptomatic triathletes seems to be associated with exercise-induced hypertension and the race distances. There appears to be a safe upper limit, beyond which exercise may result in myocardial fibrosis.", "id": "29248656", "date": "2017-12-08", "title": "Myocardial Fibrosis in Competitive Triathletes Detected by Contrast-Enhanced CMR Correlates With\u00a0Exercise-Induced Hypertension and\u00a0Competition History.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jcmg.2017.09.016", "journal": ["JACC.
