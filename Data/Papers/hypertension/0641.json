The maximal effect size (in pH units) for each additional minor allele of the identified SNPs was\u00a0-0.13 for IGFBP7,\u00a0-0.08 for ATP6V0A4, 0.06 for RHCG, and\u00a0-0.06 for SLC9A3; SNP rs34447434 in IGFBP7 had the lowest meta-analysis P value (P\u00a0= 7.1\u00a0\u00d7 10-8). After adjusting for net\u00a0alkali absorption, urine pH remained suggestively associated with multiple SNPs in IGFBP, 1 SNP in ATP6V0A4, and a new SNP in GLS (phosphate-dependent glutaminase).Overall, these findings suggest that variants in common genes involved in ammonia metabolism may substantively contribute to basal urine pH regulation. These variations might influence the likelihood of developing disease conditions associated with altered urine pH, such as uric acid or calcium phosphate kidney stones.", "id": "29270519", "date": "2017-06-21", "title": "Polymorphisms in Renal Ammonia Metabolism Genes Correlate With 24-Hour Urine pH.", "doi": "10.1016/j.ekir.2017.06.009", "journal": ["Kidney international reports", "Kidney Int Rep"]}
