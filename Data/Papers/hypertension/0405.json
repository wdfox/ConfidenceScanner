The present study aimed to investigate the effect of metformin on cell viability and its underlying mechanism, in the cultured human skin keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT. In addition, it aimed to clarify the role of the microRNA-21(miR-21)/phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)/AKT serine/threonine kinase 1 (Akt) signaling pathway, which has been hypothesized to be involved in the molecular mechanism of this drug. Cell Counting Kit\u20118 assays were used to assess the impact of metformin on cell viability; reverse transcription\u2011quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify the expression of miR\u201121; western blotting was used to monitor the expression level of PTEN and Akt proteins. In addition, miR\u201121 expression levels were artificially manipulated in HaCaT cells using a miR\u201121 inhibitor in order to observe the subsequent expression changes of miR\u201121 targets and alterations in cell viability. The results indicated that metformin suppressed HaCaT cell growth in a dose\u2011 and time\u2011dependent manner (P<0.05). Metformin treatment downregulated miR\u201121 expression (t=\u20118.903, P<0.05). Following transfection with the miR\u201121 inhibitor, HaCaT cell growth was significantly slower than in the control groups (P<0.05). In addition, reduced miR\u201121 levels results in significantly increased PTEN protein expression levels and reduced Akt protein expression levels compared with control (P<0.05). Metformin was, therefore, concluded to inhibit HaCaT cell growth in a time\u2011and dose\u2011dependent manner, and the miR\u201121/PTEN/Akt signaling pathway may serve a crucial role in the molecular mechanism of metformin's effect on HaCaT cells. Therefore the present study presents an advanced insight into the potential inhibitory effect of metformin on tumor cells.", "id": "29286158", "date": "2017-12-27", "title": "Metformin inhibits HaCaT cell viability via the miR-21/PTEN/Akt signaling pathway.", "doi": "10.3892/mmr.2017.8364", "journal": ["Molecular medicine reports", "Mol Med Rep"]}
