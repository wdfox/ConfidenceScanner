At hospital admission, he presented hypertension and AF. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed a right-side ischemic area. The thyrotoxicosis was confirmed by thyroid function and thyroid scintigraphy that showed goiter with diffuse hypercaptation. The patient was treated with tapazole and total thyroidectomy, and pathological findings suggested Graves' disease. Hyperthyroidism is associated with increased supraventricular ectopic activity in patients with a normal heart, and may be an important causal link between hyperthyroidism and AF. The patient experienced significant clinical improvement, but presented long-term neuropsychiatric disorders.", "id": "29279710", "date": "2017-10-16", "title": "Stroke in a Young Man Secondary to Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation and Thyrotoxicosis: A Case Report.", "doi": "10.1159/000479730", "journal": ["Case reports in neurology", "Case Rep Neurol"]}
