Electronic address: clhu@fudan.edu.cn."]], "text": "Aldosterone is produced by zona glomerulosa (ZG) cells of the adrenal cortex and plays a key role in balancing water and electrolytes levels. Autonomous overproduction of aldosterone leads to primary aldosteronism (PA), which is the most common form of secondary endocrine hypertension. Recently, significant progress has been made towards understanding the genetic basis of PA, where increasing clinical evidence suggests that mutations in ion channels appear to be the major cause of aldosterone-producing adenomas. In this review, we focused on potassium and calcium channels that regulate aldosterone secretion, and their roles in the pathology of PA. Because potassium and calcium channels are differentially expressed in ZG cells in different species of mammals, the limitations of published studies are also discussed.", "id": "29287775", "date": "2017-12-26", "title": "Regulation of aldosterone production by ion channels: From basal secretion to primary aldosteronism.", "doi": "10.1016/j.bbadis.2017.12.034", "journal": ["Biochimica et biophysica acta", "Biochim.
