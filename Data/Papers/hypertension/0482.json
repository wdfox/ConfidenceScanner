This is a common cause of ibrutinib discontinuation. Risk factors for atrial fibrillation include advanced age, hypertension (HTN), mitral valve disease (MVD), left atrial remodeling, coronary artery disease (CAD) and risk factors for cardiovascular dysfunction We conducted a retrospective case control study using the presence of left atrial abnormality identified on pre-ibrutinib EKGs, defined as either (1) Lead II-bifed p wave, with 40 mcsec between peaks for \u2265\u20092.5\u00a0mm wide \u2265\u2009100 msec in duration, (2) Lead V1-biphasic P wave with terminal portion \u2265\u200940 msec in duration or terminal portion \u2265\u20091\u00a0mm deep or (3) PR interval \u2265\u2009200 msec (intra-atrial conduction delay) as a predictor for development of atrial fibrillation. 183 consecutively CLL patients treated with ibrutinib were identified. 44 patients met inclusion criteria (20 cases, 24 controls). 20 (11.3%) of patients developed atrial fibrillation. Left atrial enlargement was identified as a significant predictor of development of atrial fibrillation (OR 9.1, 95% CI 2.2-37.3, p=0.02). Age, baseline HTN, CAD, diabetes, age and sex were not significant predictors. Area under the ROC curve for the model was estimated to be 75%. LAA identified by EKG is a moderately specific and sensitive finding that can identify patients at increased risk for this toxicity.", "id": "29281559", "date": "2017-12-27", "title": "Left atrial abnormality (LAA) as a predictor of ibrutinib-associated atrial fibrillation in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.", "doi": "10.1080/15384047.2017.1394554", "journal": ["Cancer biology & therapy", "Cancer Biol.
