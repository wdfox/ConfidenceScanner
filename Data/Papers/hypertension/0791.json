Methods: The analysis used data obtained from the China Chronic and non-communicable disease surveillance in 2013.The surveillance included 176 534 adults aging \u226518 years old, who were selected from 302 surveillance points by multi-stage cluster random sampling method. A total of 46 674 women at reproductive age (18-49 years old) were investigated. Blood pressures were measured by electronic blood pressure monitor. After being weighted according to complex sampling scheme and post-stratification, the rate of prevalence, awareness, treatment and control of hypertension were compared by different characteristics such as age, education, urban and rural areas, and geographic locations. Results: The prevalence of hypertension among women at reproductive age (18-49 years old) in China in 2013 was 13.5%. The rate in the rural areas was higher than that in urban areas (\u03c7(2)=46.23, P<0.05), which were 14.5% and 12.3%, respectively. The prevalence in eastern, central and western geographic locations were separately 13.9%, 13.2% and 13.1%, there was no statistical difference (\u03c7(2)=0.56, P>0.05). The hypertension prevalence in all age groups (18-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, 40-44, 45-49 years old) were 6.6%, 9.2%, 9.6%, 12.0%, 17.9% and 28.3%, respectively. The prevalence of hypertension showed a rising trend with age increasing (t=12.32, P<0.05). The awareness, treatment and control rates of hypertension were separately 25.8%, 22.7% and 7.4% in women at reproductive age (18-49 years old), which were 31.6%, 28.2% and 9.4%, respectively in urban areas; and 21.3%, 18.5% and 5.9%, respectively in rural areas. The rates in urban areas were all higher than those in rural areas (chi square were separately 18.98, 21.31, and 6.80, P values <0.05). The treatment rate of hypertension was 86.8% among who had been aware of hypertension, and the treatment rate of hypertension was 31.8% among who received control of hypertension. The treatment rate among who had been aware of hypertension in eastern, central and western locations were 89.3%, 88.3% and 79.5%, respectively. The control rates in eastern, central and western locations were 8.5%, 8.1% and 4.7%, respectively. The treatment rate among who had been aware of hypertension and control rate in the eastern and central geographic locations was higher than that in western locations (chi square were separately 10.05 and 7.25, P values <0.05). Conclusion: The prevalence of hypertension in women at reproductive age (18-49 years old) was comparatively high, and the rates of awareness, treatment and control were low. The differences showed statistical significance between urban and rural areas.\u76ee\u7684\uff1a \u5206\u67902013\u5e74\u4e2d\u56fd18~49\u5c81\u80b2\u9f84\u5987\u5973\u7684\u9ad8\u8840\u538b\u60a3\u75c5\u6c34\u5e73\u53ca\u77e5\u6653\u3001\u6cbb\u7597\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u60c5\u51b5\u3002 \u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a 2013\u5e74\u5728\u4e2d\u56fd302\u4e2a\u76d1\u6d4b\u70b9\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u5206\u5c42\u6574\u7fa4\u968f\u673a\u7684\u62bd\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u9009\u53d618\u5c81\u53ca\u4ee5\u4e0a\u5c45\u6c11\u5171\u8ba1176 534\u540d\uff0c\u5171\u8ba1\u8c03\u67e518~49\u5c81\u5973\u602746 674\u540d\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u7535\u5b50\u8840\u538b\u8ba1\u8fdb\u884c\u8840\u538b\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002\u5bf9\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u590d\u6742\u52a0\u6743\u540e\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u7279\u5f81\u80b2\u9f84\u5987\u5973\u7684\u9ad8\u8840\u538b\u60a3\u75c5\u53ca\u77e5\u6653\u3001\u6cbb\u7597\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u7387\u3002 \u7ed3\u679c\uff1a \u7ecf\u590d\u6742\u52a0\u6743\u540e\uff0c\u4e2d\u56fd18~49\u5c81\u80b2\u9f84\u5987\u5973\u9ad8\u8840\u538b\u60a3\u75c5\u7387\u4e3a13.5%\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u57ce\u5e02\u4e3a12.3%\uff0c\u519c\u6751\u4e3a14.5%\uff0c\u519c\u6751\u9ad8\u4e8e\u57ce\u5e02\uff08\u03c7(2)=46.23\uff0cP<0.05\uff09\uff1b\u4e1c\u3001\u4e2d\u3001\u897f\u90e8\u5730\u533a\u5206\u522b\u4e3a13.9%\u300113.2%\u548c13.1%\uff0c\u5dee\u5f02\u65e0\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\uff08\u03c7(2)=0.56\uff0cP>0.05\uff09\u300218~24\u300125~29\u300130~34\u300135~39\u300140~44\u53ca45~49\u5c81\u80b2\u9f84\u5987\u5973\u9ad8\u8840\u538b\u60a3\u75c5\u7387\u5206\u522b\u4e3a6.6%\u30019.2%\u30019.6%\u300112.0%\u300117.9%\u300128.3%\uff0c\u80b2\u9f84\u5987\u5973\u9ad8\u8840\u538b\u60a3\u75c5\u7387\u5448\u73b0\u968f\u7740\u5e74\u9f84\u5347\u9ad8\u800c\u5347\u9ad8\u7684\u8d8b\u52bf\uff08t=12.32,P<0.05\uff09\u300218~49\u5c81\u80b2\u9f84\u5987\u5973\u9ad8\u8840\u538b\u77e5\u6653\u7387\u3001\u6cbb\u7597\u7387\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u7387\u5206\u522b\u4e3a25.8%\u300122.7%\u548c7.4%\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u57ce\u5e02\u5206\u522b\u4e3a31.6%\u300128.2%\u548c9.4%\uff0c\u519c\u6751\u5206\u522b\u4e3a21.3%\u300118.5%\u548c5.9%\uff0c\u57ce\u5e02\u5747\u9ad8\u4e8e\u519c\u6751\uff08\u03c7(2)\u503c\u5206\u522b\u4e3a18.98\u300121.31\u548c6.80\uff0cP\u503c\u5747<0.05\uff09\u300218~49\u5c81\u80b2\u9f84\u5987\u5973\u9ad8\u8840\u538b\u77e5\u6653\u6cbb\u7597\u7387\u4e3a86.8%\uff0c\u6cbb\u7597\u63a7\u5236\u7387\u4e3a31.8%\u3002\u4e1c\u3001\u4e2d\u3001\u897f\u90e8\u5730\u533a\u9ad8\u8840\u538b\u77e5\u6653\u6cbb\u7597\u7387\u5206\u522b\u4e3a89.3%\u300188.3%\u300179.5%\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u7387\u5206\u522b\u4e3a8.5%\u30018.1%\u30014.7%\uff0c\u4e1c\u4e2d\u90e8\u5730\u533a\u9ad8\u8840\u538b\u77e5\u6653\u6cbb\u7597\u7387\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u7387\u5747\u9ad8\u4e8e\u897f\u90e8\u5730\u533a\uff08\u03c7(2)\u503c\u5206\u522b\u4e3a10.05\u548c7.25\uff0cP\u503c\u5747<0.05\uff09\u3002 \u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a \u4e2d\u56fd18~49\u5c81\u80b2\u9f84\u5987\u5973\u9ad8\u8840\u538b\u60a3\u75c5\u7387\u8f83\u9ad8\uff0c\u60a3\u75c5\u4eba\u6570\u4f17\u591a\uff0c\u800c\u77e5\u6653\u7387\u3001\u6cbb\u7597\u7387\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u7387\u5747\u5904\u4e8e\u8f83\u4f4e\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u660e\u663e\u7684\u57ce\u4e61\u3001\u5e74\u9f84\u5dee\u5f02\u3002.", "id": "29262489", "date": null, "title": "[Rate of prevalence, awareness, treatment and control of hypertension among women at reproductive age in China in 2013].", "doi": null, "journal": ["Zhonghua yu fang yi xue za zhi [Chinese journal of preventive medicine]", "Zhonghua Yu Fang Yi Xue Za Zhi"]}
