Although it is usually well tolerated, many side-effects have been reported. These include hypertension, bleeding, and thromboembolic events among others. Drug-associated cutaneous adverse effects are less common and include itching, exfoliative dermatitis, and acneiform eruptions. A man with bevacizumab-associated monomorphic skin eruption successfully was treated with 30% salicylic acid peels. To the author's knowledge, this is the first report of open comedones with no further inflammatory acne lesions that developed in a patient treated with bevacizumab. Complete remission of the rash was achieved after performing 30% salicylic peels, and the patient continued the chemotherapy as planned with no need of either dose reduction or discontinuation of bevacizumab.", "id": "29252179", "date": null, "title": "Bevacizumab-associated Sudden Onset of Multiple Monomorphic Comedones on the Scalp Successfully Treated with 30% Salicylic Acid Peels.", "doi": null, "journal": ["Acta dermatovenerologica Croatica : ADC", "Acta Dermatovenerol Croat"]}
