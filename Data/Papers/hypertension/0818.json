As a primary disease, it can present with a paraneoplastic syndrome in the form of opsoclonus, or it can present as a Horner's syndrome from its effect on the cervical sympathetic ganglia. Metastatic disease can present as a triad of periorbital edema, ecchymosis and proptosis from orbital bone involvement. Hypertension is a rare systemic presentation of neuroblastoma. We report the case of a two-year-old girl whose initial presentation of neuroblastoma was hypertensive retinopathy.To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of neuroblastoma presenting as hypertensive retinopathy. Our case highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach and thorough systemic work up of ocular findings in order to arrive at an appropriate diagnosis.", "id": "29260095", "date": "2017-06-23", "title": "Hypertensive retinopathy as the initial presentation of neuroblastoma.", "doi": "10.1016/j.ajoc.2017.06.008", "journal": ["American journal of ophthalmology case reports", "Am J Ophthalmol Case Rep"]}
