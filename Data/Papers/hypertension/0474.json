Riociguat is approved for the treatment of inoperable and persistent/recurrent CTEPH.We performed an open-label, uncontrolled, single-arm, early access study in which 300 adult patients with inoperable or persistent/recurrent CTEPH received riociguat adjusted from 1\u00a0mg three times daily (tid) to a maximum of 2.5\u00a0mg tid. Patients switching from unsatisfactory prior pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)-targeted therapy (n\u00a0=\u200984) underwent a washout period of at least 3\u00a0days before initiating riociguat. The primary aim was to assess the safety and tolerability of riociguat, with World Health Organization functional class and 6-min walking distance (6MWD) as exploratory efficacy endpoints.In total, 262 patients (87%) completed study treatment and entered the safety follow-up (median treatment duration 47\u00a0weeks). Adverse events were reported in 273 patients (91%). The most frequently reported serious adverse events were syncope (6%), right ventricular failure (3%), and pneumonia (2%). There were five deaths, none of which was considered related to study medication. The safety and tolerability of riociguat was similar in patients switched from other PAH-targeted therapies and those who were treatment na\u00efve. In patients with data available, mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation 6MWD had increased by 33\u2009\u00b1\u200942\u00a0m at Week 12 with no clinically relevant differences between the switched and treatment-na\u00efve subgroups.Riociguat was well tolerated in patients with CTEPH who were treatment na\u00efve, and in those who were switched from other PAH-targeted therapies. No new safety signals were observed.ClinicalTrials.org NCT01784562 .
