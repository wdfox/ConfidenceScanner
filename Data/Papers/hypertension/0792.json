Methods: From May 2013 to September 2014, a total of 3 474 pregnant women who took their first antenatal care and willing to undergo their prenatal care and delivery in Ma 'anshan Maternity and Child Care Centers were recruited in the cohort study. Excluding subjects without weight data before delivery (n=54), pregnancy termination (n=162), twins live births (n=39), without fetal birth weight data (n=7), 3 212 maternal-singleton pairs were enrolled for the final data analysis. Demographic information of pregnant woman, pregnancy history, disease history, height and weight were collected. In the 24(th)-28(th), 32(nd)-36(th) gestational week and childbirth, three follow-up visits were undertaken to collect data of pregnancy weight, pregnancy vomiting, gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes mellitus, newborn gender and birth weight. \u03c7(2) test was used to compare the detection rate of fetal growth restriction in different groups. Multivariate unconditional logistic regression model and spreadsheet were used to analyze the independent and interaction effect of pre-pregnancy weight and the increase of gestational weight on fetal growth restriction. Results: The incidence of fetal growth restriction was 9.7%(311/3 212). The incidence of fetal growth restriction in pre-pregnancy underweight group was 14.9% (90/603), higher than that in normal pre-pregnancy weight group (8.7% (194/2 226)) (\u03c7(2)=24.37, P<0.001). The incidence of fetal growth restriction in inadequate increase of gestational weight group was 17.9% (50/279), higher than the appropriate increase of weight group (11.8% (110/932)) (\u03c7(2)=36.89, P<0.001). Multivariate unconditional logistic regression analysis showed that compared with normal pre-pregnancy weight group, pre-pregnancy underweightwas a risk factor for fetal growth restriction, with RR (95%CI) at 1.76 (1.34-2.32); Compared with the appropriate increase of gestational weight group, inadequate weight increase during pregnancy was a risk factor for fetal growth restriction, with the RR (95%CI) at 1.70 (1.17-2.48). No additive model interaction [relative excess risk of interaction, attributable proportions of interaction, the synergy index and their 95%CI were 0.75 (-2.14-3.63), 0.21 (-0.43-0.86) and 1.43 (0.45-4.53), respectively] or multiplication model interaction (RR (95%CI): 1.00 (0.44-2.29)) existed between pre-pregnancy underweight and inadequate increase of gestational weight on fetal growth restriction. Conclusion: Pre-pregnancy underweight and inadequate increase of gestational weight would increase the risk of fetal growth restriction without interaction.\u76ee\u7684\uff1a \u63a2\u8ba8\u5b55\u524d\u4f53\u91cd\u53ca\u5b55\u671f\u589e\u91cd\u5bf9\u80ce\u513f\u751f\u957f\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002 \u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a \u4e8e2013\u5e745\u6708\u81f32014\u5e749\u6708\u62db\u52df\u5728\u9a6c\u978d\u5c71\u5e02\u5987\u5e7c\u4fdd\u5065\u9662\u8fdb\u884c\u4ea7\u68c0\u4e14\u6709\u610f\u613f\u5728\u8be5\u9662\u5206\u5a29\u7684\u5b55\u5987\u3002\u5171\u67093 474\u540d\u5b55\u5987\u8fdb\u5165\u961f\u5217\uff0c\u6392\u9664\u5206\u5a29\u524d\u4f53\u91cd\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u5931\u800554\u540d\u3001\u7ec8\u6b62\u598a\u5a20\u8005162\u540d\u3001\u53cc\u80ce\u6d3b\u4ea739\u540d\u4ee5\u53ca\u80ce\u513f\u51fa\u751f\u4f53\u91cd\u7f3a\u5931\u80057\u540d\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5c06\u8d44\u6599\u5b8c\u6574\u76843 212\u5bf9\u6bcd\u5a74\u7eb3\u5165\u5206\u6790\u3002\u6536\u96c6\u5b55\u5987\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u598a\u5a20\u53f2\u3001\u75be\u75c5\u53f2\u3001\u8eab\u9ad8\u548c\u4f53\u91cd\u7b49\u8d44\u6599\uff0c\u4e8e24~28\u300132~36\u5b55\u5468\u53ca\u5206\u5a29\u65f6\u5206\u522b\u8fdb\u884c3\u6b21\u968f\u8bbf\uff0c\u6536\u96c6\u5b55\u5987\u4f53\u91cd\u3001\u5b55\u671f\u5455\u5410\u3001\u598a\u5a20\u9ad8\u8840\u538b\u3001\u598a\u5a20\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u3001\u65b0\u751f\u513f\u6027\u522b\u548c\u51fa\u751f\u4f53\u91cd\u7b49\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u03c7(2)\u68c0\u9a8c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u7279\u5f81\u5b55\u5987\u7684\u80ce\u513f\u751f\u957f\u53d7\u9650\u68c0\u51fa\u7387\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u56e0\u7d20\u975e\u6761\u4ef6logistic\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u8ba1\u7b97\u8868\u5206\u6790\u5b55\u524d\u4f53\u91cd\u3001\u5b55\u671f\u589e\u91cd\u5bf9\u80ce\u513f\u751f\u957f\u53d7\u9650\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u6548\u5e94\u53ca\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002 \u7ed3\u679c\uff1a \u80ce\u513f\u751f\u957f\u53d7\u9650\u68c0\u51fa\u7387\u4e3a9.7%\uff08311/3 212\uff09\u3002\u5b55\u524d\u4f4e\u4f53\u91cd\u7ec4\u80ce\u513f\u751f\u957f\u53d7\u9650\u68c0\u51fa\u7387\u4e3a14.9%\uff0890/603\uff09\uff0c\u9ad8\u4e8e\u5b55\u524d\u4f53\u91cd\u6b63\u5e38\u7ec4[8.7%\uff08194/2 226\uff09]\uff08\u03c7(2)=24.37\uff0cP<0.001\uff09\uff1b\u5b55\u671f\u589e\u91cd\u4e0d\u8db3\u7ec4\u80ce\u513f\u751f\u957f\u53d7\u9650\u68c0\u51fa\u7387\u4e3a17.9%\uff0850/279\uff09\uff0c\u9ad8\u4e8e\u5b55\u671f\u589e\u91cd\u9002\u5b9c\u7ec4[11.8%\uff08110/932\uff09]\uff08\u03c7(2)=36.89\uff0cP<0.001\uff09\u3002\u591a\u56e0\u7d20\u975e\u6761\u4ef6logistic\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4e0e\u5b55\u524d\u6b63\u5e38\u4f53\u91cd\u7ec4\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5b55\u524d\u4f4e\u4f53\u91cd\u662f\u80ce\u513f\u751f\u957f\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u5371\u9669\u56e0\u7d20[RR\uff0895%CI\uff09\uff1a1.76\uff081.34~2.32\uff09]\uff1b\u4e0e\u5b55\u671f\u589e\u91cd\u9002\u5b9c\u7ec4\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5b55\u671f\u589e\u91cd\u4e0d\u8db3\u662f\u80ce\u513f\u751f\u957f\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u5371\u9669\u56e0\u7d20[RR\uff0895%CI\uff09\uff1a1.70\uff081.17~2.48\uff09]\u3002\u5b55\u524d\u4f4e\u4f53\u91cd\u4e0e\u5b55\u671f\u589e\u91cd\u4e0d\u8db3\u65e0\u76f8\u52a0\u6a21\u578b\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528[\u76f8\u5bf9\u8d85\u989d\u5371\u9669\u5ea6\u3001\u5f52\u56e0\u6bd4\u3001\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6307\u6570\u5206\u522b\u4e3a0.75\uff0895%CI\uff1a-2.14~3.63\uff09\u30010.21\uff0895%CI\uff1a-0.43~0.86\uff09\u30011.43\uff0895%CI\uff1a0.45~4.53\uff09]\u548c\u76f8\u4e58\u6a21\u578b\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528[RR\uff0895%CI\uff09\uff1a1.00\uff080.44~2.29\uff09]\u3002 \u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a \u5b55\u524d\u4f4e\u4f53\u91cd\u548c\u5b55\u671f\u589e\u91cd\u4e0d\u8db3\u589e\u52a0\u80ce\u513f\u751f\u957f\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4e8c\u8005\u65e0\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002.", "id": "29262487", "date": null, "title": "[The effect of pre-pregnancy weight and the increase of gestational weight on fetal growth restriction: a cohort study].", "doi": null, "journal": ["Zhonghua yu fang yi xue za zhi [Chinese journal of preventive medicine]", "Zhonghua Yu Fang Yi Xue Za Zhi"]}
