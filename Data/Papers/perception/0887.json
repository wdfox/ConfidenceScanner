Chronic pain is frequently treated with opiates, which has produced an opiate addiction crisis (Dowell et al., 2016). Several non-pharmacological treatment alternatives can help manage chronic pain. There is moderate evidence that mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) such as meditation, yoga, and stress reduction lower the perception of pain, increase mobility, improve functioning and well-being. By integrating MBIs and other therapeutic interventions in a multi-disciplinary pain management plan, clinicians can improve treatment outcomes and potentially decrease pain-related medication utilization.", "doi": "10.1016/j.ajp.2017.11.025", "title": "Mindfulness-based interventions for chronic pain: Evidence and applications.", "journal": ["Asian journal of psychiatry", "Asian J Psychiatr"]}
