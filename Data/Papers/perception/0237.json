A retrospective cohort study with negative colonoscopy patients was created and 169 postoperative incontinent patients were analyzed (114 women and 55 men: mean age 58.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.3): clinical evaluation, endoanal ultrasound and anorectal manometry reports were scanned. The duration of incontinence was very long, with a mean of 21.7\u00a0months. The mean number of bowel movements/week was 18.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.2. Urge incontinence was present in 82.2% of patients, mixed with passive incontinence in 44 patients. Patients' Fecal Incontinence Severity Index (FISI) score was 27.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.6. Operated patients had significantly lower anal resting pressure (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) than controls while patients with colo-anal anastomosis and those who underwent Delorme operation had lowest values (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Maximal tolerated volume and rectal compliance were significantly impaired in operated patients with rectum involvement (colo-anal anastomosis, Delorme, restorative procto-colectomy and STARR). External anal sphincter (EAS) defects were present in 33.1% of all patients and internal anal sphincter (IAS) was damaged in 44.3%: a combined lesion of anal sphincters was detected in 39 patients (23.0%). A positive correlation was found between patients' FISI score and thickness of both sphincters (EAS: \u03c1s = 73; IAS: \u03c1s\u00a0=\u00a081). Malfunctioning continence factors may induce fecal incontinence involving each time, in a different way, the volumetric capacity and/or the motility of the rectum, the perception of the fecal bolus and anal sphincter contraction.", "doi": "10.1007/s13304-017-0508-y", "title": "Post-surgical fecal incontinence.", "journal": ["Updates in surgery", "Updates Surg"]}
