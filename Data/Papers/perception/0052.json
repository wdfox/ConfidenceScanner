This can be possible only if machines follow the human processes: the perception-action loop. People perceive and act to understand new objects or to promote specific behavior to their partners. In return, the object/person provides information that induces another reaction, and so on.", "doi": "10.1017/S0140525X1700022X", "title": "Social-motor experience and perception-action learning bring efficiency to machines.", "journal": ["The Behavioral and brain sciences", "Behav Brain Sci"]}
