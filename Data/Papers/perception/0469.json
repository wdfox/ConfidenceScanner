Nursing students undergo different interprofessional education activities in all four academic years, covering various aspects of the following competencies: interprofessional communication, role clarification (definition, interaction and defense), and authority models and decision making. In second year, they integrate these activities with students from psychology, pharmacy and medicine. We assessed the self-perception of second year nursing students with an adapted and validated IPEC (Interprofessional Education Collaborative) questionnaire, in four different transversal moments of the academic year 2015-16. Differences in mean values were analyzed with the Kruskal-Wallis test and post-hoc Mann-Whitney tests with Bonferroni corrections in case of statistical significance. Results showed that this IPE program improves the self-perception second year students have about their competence in interprofessional communication, especially in the dimensions of oral expression, active listening, communication tools and interprofessional conflict resolution.", "doi": "10.1080/13561820.2017.1417240", "title": "Impact of the first interprofessional education undergraduate program in Spain.", "journal": ["Journal of interprofessional care", "J Interprof Care"]}
