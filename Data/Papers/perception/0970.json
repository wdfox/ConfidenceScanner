The data were analysed with paired sample t tests and random intercept regression models.156 patients completed both the baseline and the 6-month follow-up assessments. After 6\u00a0months, 137 (88%) patients return to work (86% male, M age\u2009=\u200951.9\u2009\u00b1\u20098.1). The patients predominantly underwent angioplasty/bypass (46%) or valve replacement/repair (38%). Work hours (WO), job satisfaction (JS), and job involvement (JI) significantly decreased after RTW (WO: t (132)\u2009=\u20092.07, p\u2009<\u20090.05; JS: t (134)\u2009=\u20092.56, p\u2009<\u20090.05; JI: t (129)\u2009=\u20094.14, p\u2009<\u20090.001). The decrease in work hours over time was associated with a within-subjects decrease in psychological job demands (\u03b2\u2009=\u20095.107, t (112.1)\u2009=\u20092.21, p\u2009<\u20090.05) and job satisfaction (\u03b2\u2009=\u20092.498, t (112.92)\u2009=\u20092.265, p\u2009<\u20090.05) and an increase in physical job demands (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-\u20091.314, t (112.07)\u2009=\u2009-\u20092.416, p\u2009<\u20090.05). The decrease in job satisfaction over time was related to a within-subjects decrease in decision latitude (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.505, t (116.43)\u2009=\u20092.825, p\u2009<\u20090.01) and an increase in psychological job demand (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.586, t (116.78)\u2009=\u2009-\u20093.141, p\u2009<\u20090.01). The decrease in job involvement over time was associated with a decrease in physical job demands (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.063, t (117.19)\u2009=\u20092.157, p\u2009<\u20090.05) within-subjects.The study showed that many patients who RTW after angioplasty or heart surgery have poorer work experiences relative to changes in psychological and physical demands and more passive roles.", "doi": "10.1007/s00420-017-1282-3", "title": "Quality of work experience after angioplasty or heart surgery: a monocentric cohort study.", "journal": ["International archives of occupational and environmental health", "Int Arch Occup Environ Health"]}
