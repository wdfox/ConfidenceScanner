However, it is still unknown whether performance on ISWT-H and ISWT-T are similar in patients with bronchiectasis. In this study, we compared the performance, physiological responses, and perception of effort between the ISWT-T with a handrail and ISWT-H for subjects with bronchiectasis. We also sought to estimate and compare the prescription for training intensity with both tests.This was a cross-sectional study in which 24 subjects with bronchiectasis were evaluated on 2 different days (24 h apart). Distance walked (m) was compared between the ISWT-H and ISWT-T. A training session was held on a treadmill at 75% of the speed obtained from both tests. The walking distance, oxygen uptake (V\u0307O2 ), carbon dioxide production (V\u0307CO2 ), heart rate, and ventilation (V\u0307E) were measured.There was a difference in the walking distance between the ISWT-T and ISWT-H, but physiological responses for V\u0307O2 , V\u0307CO2 , heart rate, and V\u0307E were similar. However, the speed estimated for training was different, as were the V\u0307O2 , V\u0307CO2 , and heart rate.The ISWT-T with handrail and the ISWT-H are not interchangeable in subjects with bronchiectasis. A slower speed of training intensity may occur when the test is performed in a hallway, as originally described, and this may underestimate responses to aerobic training.", "doi": "10.4187/respcare.05735", "title": "Incremental Shuttle Walk Test to Assess and Prescribe Exercise for Subjects With Bronchiectasis: Hallway Versus Treadmill.", "journal": ["Respiratory care", "Respir Care"]}
