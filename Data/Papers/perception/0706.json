Initially, they had to complete a survey exploring their knowledge on analgesics and potential fear of using opioids. The second phase was based on the in-depth interviews with 10 palliative care patients suffering from cancer pain who were reluctant to use opioids.\u00a0 RESULTS\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Almost half (43/100) of the patients expressed concerns over commencing the treatment with opioids. Fear was encountered more frequently among the patients already on strong opioids, and either admitting to it (Group C), or not (Group B), as compared to those treated with the weak opioids (Group A), i.e. 50% and 48% vs. 19%, respectively. Dominant type of concerns related to drug addiction, fear of death/dying, and undesirable side effects. A qualitative study revealed similar types of fear among the patients expressing \u00a0concerns prior to being put on strong opioids.\u00a0 CONCLUSIONS\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Opiophobia appears a frequent enough phenomenon among palliative care patients (up to 50%) treated with strong opioids. It originates primarily in drug addiction hazard, undesirable effects, and a diversity of death/dying issues. Better awareness of patients' preconceptions on opioids may well become instrumental in alleviating their suffering through enhanced pain management.", "doi": "10.20452/pamw.4167", "title": "Why patients are afraid of opioid analgesics - study on opioid perception in patients treated for chronic pain.", "journal": ["Polish archives of internal medicine", null]}
