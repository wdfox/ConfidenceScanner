Participants were recruited using convenience sampling.Ninety-one percent of the students agreed or strongly agreed that the use of clickers helped them to develop a better understanding of the subject matter when compared to traditional lecture based class.The findings portray a positive correlation of learning and an enhanced pedagogical approach for nursing students.", "doi": "10.1016/j.nedt.2017.12.027", "title": "Millennial's perspective of clicker technology in a nursing classroom: A Mixed methods research study.", "journal": ["Nurse education today", "Nurse Educ Today"]}
