It has been argued that endogenous oscillatory brain activity could provide the functional substrate of cortical rhythmic sampling. A new study demonstrates that cortical rhythmic sampling is tightly linked to the oculomotor system, thus, providing a novel perspective on the neural network underlying top-down guided visual perception.", "doi": "10.1152/jn.00810.2017", "title": "The Rhythmic Nature of Visual Perception.", "journal": ["Journal of neurophysiology", "J.
