This questionnaire encompassed 41 statements organized around seven key domains: overall satisfaction related to the training program, satisfaction related to the overground robotic exoskeleton, satisfaction related to the program attributes, perceived learnability, perceived health benefits and risks and perceived motivation to engage in physical activity. Each statement was rated using a visual analogue scale ranging from \"0\u2009=\u2009totally disagree\" to \"100\u2009=\u2009completely agree\".Overall, respondents unanimously considered themselves satisfied with the locomotor training program with the robotic exoskeleton (95.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7%) and provided positive feedback about the robotic exoskeleton itself (82.3\u2009\u00b1\u20096.9%), the attributes of the locomotor training program (84.5\u2009\u00b1\u20096.9%) and their ability to learn to perform sit-stand transfers and walk with the robotic exoskeleton (79.6\u2009\u00b1\u200917%). Respondents perceived some health benefits (67.9\u2009\u00b1\u200916.7%) and have reported no fear of developing secondary complications or of potential risk for themselves linked to the use of the robotic exoskeleton (16.7\u2009\u00b1\u20098.2%). At the end of the program, respondents felt motivated to engage in a regular physical activity program (91.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1%).This study provides new insights on satisfaction and perceptions of wheelchair users while also confirming the relevance to continue to improve such technologies, and informing the development of future clinical trials. Implications for Rehabilitation All long-term manual wheelchair users with a spinal cord injury who participated in the study are unanimously satisfied upon completion of a 6-8-week locomotor training program with the robotic exoskeleton and would recommend the program to their peers. All long-term manual wheelchair users with a spinal cord injury who participated in the study offered positive feedback about the robotic exoskeleton itself and feel it is easy to learn to perform sit-stand transfers and walk with the robotic exoskeleton. All long-term manual wheelchair users with a spinal cord injury who participated in the study predominantly perceived improvements in their overall health status, upper limb strength and endurance as well as in their sleep and psychological well-being upon completion of a 6-8-week locomotor training program with the robotic exoskeleton. All long-term manual wheelchair users with a spinal cord injury who participated in the study unanimously felt motivated to engage in a regular physical activity program adapted to their condition and most of them do plan to continue to participate in moderate-to-strenuous physical exercise. Additional research on clients' perspectives, especially satisfaction with the overground exoskeleton and locomotor training program attributes, is needed.", "doi": "10.1080/17483107.2017.1413145", "title": "Satisfaction and perceptions of long-term manual wheelchair users with a spinal cord injury upon completion of a locomotor training program with an overground robotic exoskeleton.", "journal": ["Disability and rehabilitation.
