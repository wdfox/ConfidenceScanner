A complete examination revealed visual acuity consisting in light perception, a complete hyphema, and an intraocular pressure of 45 mm Hg with moderate pain. Our diagnostic approached was ultrasound based with B-scan examination showing some vitreous hemorrhage and ultrasound biomicroscopy showing a large iris disinsertion of 270\u00b0 with the iris entirely dislocated in the inferior sector of the anterior chamber. The patient was hospitalized and a systemic and topical treatment was started to lower intraocular pressure. Our surgery consisted in a single-step approach with removal of traumatic cataract with scleral fixation of an intraocular lens and iridoplasty.In our patient, the single-step surgery, supported by anterior and posterior ultrasound imaging, achieved a satisfactory anatomical and functional outcome.", "doi": "10.1159/000480726", "title": "Diagnostic and Therapeutic Approach in a Case of Severe Post-Traumatic Hyphema with Subtotal Iridodialysis.", "journal": ["Case reports in ophthalmology", "Case Rep Ophthalmol"]}
