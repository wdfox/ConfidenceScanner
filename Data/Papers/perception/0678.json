This review identifies how the perceived risk of stroke has been measured and outcomes in terms of levels, predictors, accuracy, and intervention results. Sixteen studies were included. The perceived risk of stroke has primarily been assessed with single-item measures; no multi-item surveys were found. In general, people tend to perceive a low-moderate risk of stroke; the most common predictors of higher stroke risk perceptions were having risk factors for stroke (hypertension, diabetes) and a higher number of risk factors. However, inaccuracies were common; at least half of respondents underestimated/overestimated their risk. Few studies have examined whether interventions can improve the perceived risk of stroke. Strategies to improve stroke risk perceptions should be explored to determine whether accuracy can promote healthy lifestyles to reduce stroke risk.", "doi": "10.1177/0193945917747856", "title": "Measurement and Outcomes of the Perceived Risk of Stroke: A Review.", "journal": ["Western journal of nursing research", "West J Nurs Res"]}
