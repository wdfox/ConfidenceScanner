In Stage 1, 2782 adolescents aged 11-16 years from British secondary schools were screened for peer bullying and victimisation. In Stage 2, 411 adolescents with weight and height data (objective n\u202f=\u202f319, self-report n\u202f=\u202f92) also self-reported on their weight perception and appearance-specific feedback. Neither bullying nor victimisation were related to objective underweight or overweight. Victims were at increased odds of overweight misperception, while bully-victims were at increased odds of underweight misperception. Additionally, there was an indirect effect of appearance feedback on overweight misperception in bully-victims. Both victims and bully-victims are at increased risk of weight misperception, posing further detrimental effects to their health and wellbeing.", "doi": "10.1016/j.adolescence.2017.12.008", "title": "Bullying and negative appearance feedback among adolescents: Is it objective or misperceived weight that matters?", "journal": ["Journal of adolescence", "J Adolesc"]}
