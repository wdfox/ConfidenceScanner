The capability to compute the well-known types of harmonic triads means that their perception is not simply a consequence of learning an arbitrary cultural \"idiom\" handed down from the Italian Renaissance. On the contrary, for typical listeners familiar with diatonic music, attention to certain, definable, acoustical features underlies the perception of the valence (modality) and the inherent tension (instability) of three-tone harmonies.", "doi": "10.1121/1.5018342", "title": "Calculation of the acoustical properties of triadic harmonies.", "journal": ["The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America", "J.
