A number of anecdotal reports have shown that TERPs diffuse pain, including chronic, inflammatory, and neuropathic. Pain is a very complex biochemical and electrical process involving sensory part, nerve transmission, and brain perception of pain. We concentrated our research on nerve transmission, which is electrical signal along the nerve (axon). This electrical signal is created by a complex activity of opening and closing of pain related ion channels and redistribution of electrically charged ions on the nerve cell membrane. Ion channels are made of different proteins, which are involved with the complex processes of opening and closing ion channels. Here, we apply the resonant recognition model to analyze ion channel proteins related to the pain transmission in order to find out, how imprints and particles within TERPs can interfere with pain related activity of ion channels.", "doi": "10.1109/TNB.2017.2775645", "title": "Influence of Tuning Element Relief Patches on Pain as Analyzed by the Resonant Recognition Model.", "journal": ["IEEE transactions on nanobioscience", "IEEE Trans Nanobioscience"]}
