Flexibility only increased for the fingertip to floor test in both phases in the Post50/Post AMR compared to Post (CON14.33\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.19Pre, 15.07\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.37Post (p\u00a0=\u00a00.7) and 12.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.69Post50 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.4); INT14.53\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.06Pre, 13.87\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.88Post (p\u00a0=\u00a00.2) and 11.03\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.96Post AMR (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001)). The Well's bench improved only for the Post AMR compared to Pre in the INT phase (INT24.79\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.91Pre; 27.67\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.46Post AMR p\u00a0=\u00a00.0000023).We concluded that AMR is effective to reduce pain perception and to improve flexibility of the studied population submitted to a high intense exercise session.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jbmt.2017.05.013", "title": "Aquatic myofascial release applied after high intensity exercise increases flexibility and decreases pain.", "journal": ["Journal of bodywork and movement therapies", "J Bodyw Mov Ther"]}
