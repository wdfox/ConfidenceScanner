Patients were divided into 3 subgroups according to the angle of deviation at postoperative day 1: overcorrection group (\u22652 prism diopter [PD] of esodeviation), orthotropic group (orthotropia or <5 PD of exodeviation), and undercorrection group (\u22655 PD of exodeviation). Success was defined as \u22645 PD of esodeviation or \u226410 PD of exodeviation at the final visit.One hundred and six patients were included in this study. Age at surgery was 11.8 \u00b1 6.9 years, and preoperative angle of deviation was 22.9 \u00b1 6.3 PD at distant. Patients were followed-up for 24.4 \u00b1 12.8 months. There were 20 (18.9%), 82 (77.4%), and 4 (3.8%) patients in overcorrection, orthotropic, and undercorrection groups at postoperative day 1 (p = 0.001). The surgical success rate at the final visit in the overcorrection group (95%) was higher than that in orthotropic and undercorrection groups (76.8% and 25%, respectively, p = 0.004). In univariate regression analysis, overcorrection at postoperative day 1 was the only reliable factor for long-term success (odds ratio [OR] = 24.101, p = 0.01).Overcorrection at postoperative day 1 is a good surgical predictor of successful outcome in surgery for recurrent exotropia.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jcjo.2017.05.015", "title": "Early postoperative overcorrection in recurrent exotropia.", "journal": ["Canadian journal of ophthalmology.
