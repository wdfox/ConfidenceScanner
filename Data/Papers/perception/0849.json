We examine how self-regulation theory can be applied to inform our understanding of decision-making processes within the context of genomic testing, a clinical arena in which individuals face complex risk information and potentially life-altering decisions. After presenting key principles of self-regulation, we present a genomic testing case example to illustrate how principles related to risk representations, approach and avoidance motivations, emotion regulation, defensive responses, temporal construals, and capacities such as numeric abilities can shape decisions and psychological responses during the genomic testing process. We conclude with implications for using self-regulation theory to advance science within genomic testing and opportunities for how this research can inform further developments in self-regulation theory.", "doi": "10.1111/spc3.12315", "title": "Self-Regulation Principles Underlying Risk Perception and Decision Making within the Context of Genomic Testing.", "journal": ["Social and personality psychology compass", "Soc Personal Psychol Compass"]}
