The principles of qualitative content analysis were used for analysing data.Three themes emerged. The informants experienced the RAFAELA system to be a basis for a precise and common langue. Furthermore, the informants considered it to be a system defining quality standards of nursing care. Finally, the RAFAELA system provided daily documentation of nursing intensity and thus was considered an important management tool for balancing patient needs with appropriate staff.", "doi": "10.1002/nop2.115", "title": "Exploring nurse managers' perception of using the RAFAELA system as a management tool in a Norwegian hospital setting.", "journal": ["Nursing open", "Nurs Open"]}
