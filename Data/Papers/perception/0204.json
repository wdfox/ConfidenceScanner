Using a sample of 266 survivors of sexual assault during their college years, results from a multinomial regression identified factors linked with the odds of making either a formal report to university officials, an informal disclosure, or telling no one of the assault. Survivors were more likely to formally report the sexual assault to university officials if they had received sexual assault training, if the assault included vaginal or anal penetration, and if the survivor had a positive perception of the overall campus climate. Survivors were less likely to formally report the assault to university officials if the perpetrator was an acquaintance, friend, or dating partner compared with a stranger. Racial or ethnic minorities were less likely to formally report or informally disclose the assault. Our findings suggest that universities can aid survivors in reporting their sexual assault through education, training, and improving the overall campus climate.", "doi": "10.1177/0886260517717490", "title": "Factors Related to College Students' Decisions to Report Sexual Assault.", "journal": ["Journal of interpersonal violence", "J Interpers Violence"]}
