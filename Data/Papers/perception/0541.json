Case records of all patients coded as endophthalmitis and then panophthalmitis were included. Data were collected regarding the clinical features, demographic profile, and treatment outcomes of those cases.This study included 33 eyes of 33 patients. The mean age at presentation was 42.33\u00a0\u00b1\u00a021.66\u00a0years (median 40, range 5-75). The commonest etiology of endophthalmitis progressing to panophthalmitis was noted following open globe injury endophthalmitis, seen in 13/33 (39.4%) of eyes followed by endophthalmitis associated with microbial keratitis seen in 8/33 (27.3%) eyes. The time interval in days between the diagnosis of endophthalmitis and progression to panophthalmitis was 4.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.88\u00a0days (median 3\u00a0days, range 1-14\u00a0days). Fifteen eyes denied perception of light (PL) at the time of diagnosing panophthalmitis. Culture was positive in 16 cases (48.4%), Streptococcus pneumoniae was the commonest species (4 cases) followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3 cases) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (2 cases). Nine cases (27.27%) were additionally given systemic steroids along with the systemic antibiotics. The odds ratio of a favorable outcome was significantly higher when systemic steroids with antibiotics were administered (OR\u00a0=\u00a080.5, 95% C.I. 6.311026, p\u00a0=\u00a00.007), when the patient was of a younger age group (< 40\u00a0years) (OR 1.53, 95% C.I. 0.37.87, p\u00a0=\u00a00.6), when the presenting vision at diagnosis was at least light perception (OR 9.8, 95% C.I. 1.03692.7, p\u00a0=\u00a00.04), when the smear showed Gram-positive cocci (OR 6.66, 95% C.I. 1.0940.43, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03), if there was culture positivity (OR 10.5, 95% C.I. 1.1198.9, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03) and when intravenous antibiotics were administered (OR 21.43, 95% C.I. 1.11411.7, p\u00a0=\u00a00.04).Risk of progression of endophthalmitis to panophthalmitis is there even under care. Close observation and keen clinical examination for cases that do not respond well is essential. Intravenous antibiotics and systemic steroids should be considered in all cases of endophthalmitis that progress to panophthalmitis.", "doi": "10.1080/08820538.2017.1416411", "title": "Endophthalmitis Progressing to Panophthalmitis: Clinical Features, Demographic Profile, and Factors Predicting Outcome.", "journal": ["Seminars in ophthalmology", "Semin Ophthalmol"]}
