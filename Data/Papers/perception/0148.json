For example, a short glance at a person's face provides information on identity and emotional state. What are the computations the brain uses to solve these problems so accurately and seemingly effortlessly? This article summarizes current research on computational modeling, a technique used to answer this question. Specifically, my research studies the hypothesis that this algorithm is tasked to solve the inverse problem of production. For example, to recognize identity, our brain needs to identify shape and shading image features that are invariant to facial expression, pose and illumination. Similarly, to recognize emotion, the brain needs to identify shape and shading features that are invariant to identity, pose and illumination. If one defines the physics equations that render an image under different identities, expressions, poses and illuminations, then gaining invariance to these factors is readily resolved by computing the inverse of this rendering function. I describe our current understanding of the algorithms used by our brains to resolve this inverse problem. I also discuss how these results are driving research in computer vision to design computer systems that are as accurate, robust and efficient as humans.", "doi": "10.1177/0963721417698535", "title": "Computational Models of Face Perception.", "journal": ["Current directions in psychological science", "Curr Dir Psychol Sci"]}
