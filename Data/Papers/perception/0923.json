Following the logic of illusory conjunctions, we calculated the cross-ear migration of tones, rhymes, and their combination in Chinese and English listeners. For Chinese listeners, tones migrated more than rhymes. For English listeners, the opposite pattern was found. The results lend empirical support to autosegmental theory, which claims separability and mobility between tonal and segmental representations. They also provide evidence that such representations and their involvement in perception are deeply shaped by a listener's linguistic experience.", "doi": "10.1177/0023830916675897", "title": "Separability of Tones and Rhymes in Chinese Speech Perception: Evidence from Perceptual Migrations.", "journal": ["Language and speech", "Lang Speech"]}
