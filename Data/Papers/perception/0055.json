We argue that the influence of continuous visual properties does not challenge the notion of number sense, but reveals limit conditions for the computation that yields invariance in numerosity perception. Alternative accounts should be formalized in a computational model.", "doi": "10.1017/S0140525X16002326", "title": "Computational foundations of the visual number sense.", "journal": ["The Behavioral and brain sciences", "Behav Brain Sci"]}
