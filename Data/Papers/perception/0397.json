Each of the five factors on the recovery measure was significantly and negatively associated with each of the four factors on the stigma measure.Perspectives of recovery orientation and stigma are significantly, but negatively, associated. Future research should investigate the direction of causality behind these observed relationships, as this will provide the opportunity to identify potential interventions to increase recovery-oriented mental health care and reduce stigmatization.", "doi": "10.1080/09638237.2017.1417573", "title": "The association of recovery orientation and stigmatizing beliefs.", "journal": ["Journal of mental health (Abingdon, England)", "J Ment Health"]}
