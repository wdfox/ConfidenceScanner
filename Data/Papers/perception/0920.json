The most common postoperative finding was posterior capsule opacification in 20 eyes (66.7%). Visually significant cystoid macular edema occurred in 4 eyes (13.3%) despite the postoperative eye drop regimen. Patient satisfaction at 1 month postoperatively was noted as 93.3% (28 eyes) and attributed mostly to improved central vision and reduced glare symptoms.Patients with visually significant cataract in association with retinal dystrophy have significantly improved best-corrected visual acuity after cataract surgery and report subjectively improved visual functioning. This study confirms that several risks factors are greater in patients with retinal dystrophy, including zonular weakness, posterior capsular opacification, and cystoid macular edema, compared with the general cataract population.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jcjo.2017.04.002", "title": "Cataract surgery outcomes and complications in retinal dystrophy patients.", "journal": ["Canadian journal of ophthalmology.
