Our recent psychophysical study demonstrated that 1) observed action (OA) perception differs from shape perception in viewpoint and duration dependence, and 2) accuracy and reaction times of OA discrimination are fitted by the proportional-rate diffusion model whereby a sensory stage provides noisy evidence that is accumulated up to a criterion or bound by a decision stage. That study was devoted to observation of manipulative actions, following a general trend of the field. Recent functional imaging studies of action observation, however, have established various OA classes as separate entities with processing routes involving distinct posterior parietal cortex (PPC) regions. Here, we show that the diffusion model applies to multiple OA classes. Even more importantly, the observers' ability to discriminate exemplars of a given class differs considerably between OA classes and these performance differences correspond to differences in model parameters. In particular, OA classes differ in the bound parameter which we propose may reflect an urgency signal originating in the PPC regions corresponding to the sensory stages of different OA classes.", "doi": "10.1038/s41598-017-17369-z", "title": "Not all observed actions are perceived equally.", "journal": ["Scientific reports", "Sci Rep"]}
