Cronbach's \u03b1 and intraclass correlation coefficient of the 2\u00a0week test-retest scores were computed to establish reliability. Exploratory factor analysis was performed to support the validity of the Spiritual Climate Scale Arabic version.The Spiritual Climate Scale Arabic version manifested excellent content validity. Exploratory factor analysis supported a single factor with an explained variance of 73.2%. The Cronbach's \u03b1 values of the scale ranged from .79 to .88, while the intraclass correlation coefficient value was .90. The perceived spiritual climate was associated with the respondents' hospital, gender, age and years of experience.Findings of this study support the sound psychometric properties of the Spiritual Climate Scale Arabic version.The Spiritual Climate Scale Arabic version can be used by nurse managers to assess the nurses' perception of the spiritual climate in any clinical area. This process can lead to spiritually centred interventions, thereby ensuring a clinical climate that accepts and respects different spiritual beliefs and practices.", "doi": "10.1111/jonm.12574", "title": "Psychometric assessment of the Spiritual Climate Scale Arabic version for nurses in Saudi Arabia.", "journal": ["Journal of nursing management", "J Nurs Manag"]}
