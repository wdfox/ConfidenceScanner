The patient's preoperative best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of the right eye was 0.4 (0.4 logMAR) (with + 21.00 D), postoperative 1st and 3rd month, 1st year, and 3 years BCVAs were 0.4 (0.4 logMAR). The intraocular pressure was 15 mmHg preoperatively, and 14, 12, 12, and 15 mmHg postoperatively at 1st and 3rd month, 1st year, and 3 years, respectively. The preoperative endothelial cell density (ECD) was 2372 cells/mm2, and postoperative ECDs were 2352, 2391, 2246, and 2240 cells/mm2 at 1st and 3rd months, at 1st year, and 3 years respectively. In aphakic nanophthalmic eyes with inadequate capsular support, which require high IOL dioptry, the implantation of double ICIOLs (one in front of the iris and the other behind the iris) seems to be safe and provides good visual rehabilitation.", "doi": "10.4103/ijo.IJO_441_17", "title": "Implantation of a double iris-claw intraocular lens in an aphakic nanophthalmic eye.", "journal": ["Indian journal of ophthalmology", "Indian J Ophthalmol"]}
