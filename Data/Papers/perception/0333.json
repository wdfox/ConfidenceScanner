In this study, the role of 5-HT2 and D2 receptors in neuroprotective effects of maternal forced exercise in offspring neurodevelopment and effect on some behaviors were evaluated.Forty-eight pregnant rats were trained by forced exercise, and some behavioral assays in their offspring were performed in the presence and absence of 5-HT2 and D2 receptor antagonists in various experimental groups.Our data showed that maternal forced exercise caused increase in latency of pain perception in offsprings in hot plate test, writhing test (WT), and tail flick test. Furthermore, a decrease in intensity was shown by WT. On the other hand, treatment of mothers by forced exercise in combination with 5-HT2 and D2 receptor antagonists could inhibit these effects of forced exercise and cause disturbances in pain perception and intensity.Our data suggested that maternal forced exercise causes protective effects on offspring pain perception and intensity, and in this effect, 5-HT2 and D2 receptors are probably involved.", "doi": "10.4103/2277-9175.218026", "title": "Preventive Effect of Maternal Forced Exercise on Offspring Pain Perception and Intensity: The Role of 5-HT2 and D2 Receptors.", "journal": ["Advanced biomedical research", "Adv Biomed Res"]}
