This article studies inattentional blindness in radiologists' interpretation of scans. Furthermore, it is discussed, how attention - being a limited resource - is distributed in the diagnostic process. Does focus on one diagnosis make us blind to findings supporting a differential diagnosis? Does focus on typing patient data into electronic health records draw attention away from the general clinical view of the patient?", "doi": null, "title": "[Inattentional blindness in the diagnostic process].", "journal": ["Ugeskrift for laeger", "Ugeskr.
