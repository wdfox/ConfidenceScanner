Three superordinate themes emerged in the analysis: experiencing quality of life through the perception of self and identity, interpersonal relationships as facilitators and barriers to quality of life and life in a wheelchair: pain experience and management. Quality of life for those living with paraplegia and chronic pain is experienced as a complex interaction across several life domains. The use of photographs may improve the communication of pain-related experiences and understanding by healthcare staff.", "doi": "10.1177/1359105317750254", "title": "'I am free in my wheelchair but pain does have a say in it though': The meaning and experience of quality of life when living with paraplegia and chronic pain.", "journal": ["Journal of health psychology", "J Health Psychol"]}
