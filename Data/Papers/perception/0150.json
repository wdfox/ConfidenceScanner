Firstly, under the restricted isometry property (RIP) condition, the uniqueness of solution for the minimization model with a given sparsity s is obtained through the theoretical analysis. With a mild condition, we get that the larger of the q, the more effective of the sparse recovery model under sensing matrix satisfies RIP conditions at fixed p. Secondly, using a smoothing approximate method, we propose the smoothing inertial projection neural network (SIPNN) algorithm for solving the proposed general model. Under certain conditions, the proposed algorithm can converge to a stationary point. Finally, convergence behavior and successful recover performance experiments and a comparison experiment confirm the effectiveness of the proposed SIPNN algorithm.", "doi": "10.1016/j.neunet.2017.12.008", "title": "Smoothing inertial projection neural network for minimization Lp-q in sparse signal reconstruction.", "journal": ["Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society", "Neural Netw"]}
