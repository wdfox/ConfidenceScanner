These new demonstrations provide further evidence that volume completion is not dictated solely by contour relatability constraints, but is instead a dynamic process of 3D shape construction that also takes into account dynamic cues to object shape, even in the absence of any contour relatability whatsoever.", "doi": "10.1177/2041669517740368", "title": "Dynamic Volume Completion and Deformation.", "journal": ["i-Perception", "Iperception"]}
