Social factors influencing health awareness were the basis of many previous investigations, measuring the effect of demographical and psychological factors. However, investigation of these factors usually happened with separated questions.The aim of the present study is to test a new questionnaire, which measures health behaviour and attitudes related to health awareness.In present study, the attention was drawn to the introduction of a new questionnaire related to health behaviour, attitudes toward health awareness and factors influencing those and measured on population in Debrecen (SHTE 2017; n = 256).the new measurement proved to be reliable based on Cronbach \u03b1 analysis. This was created on the basis of focus content analysis of group conversations with 10 subscales and 35 items.It can be stated that gender, father's educational level, objective and subjective financial status has a significantly negative effect; while sport, subjective health and fitness as well as subjective religiosity have a significantly positive effect which reflects previous findings and confirm the reliability of our questionnaire.
