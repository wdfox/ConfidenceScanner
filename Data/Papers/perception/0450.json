The target population evaluated all items as easy to understand. The mean overall clarity and verbal comprehension observed in the pre-test reached 4.48 \u00b1 0.16 out of the maximum value of 5 on the psychometric Likert scale.Based on the methodology used, the experts' analysis and the results of the pre-test, it is concluded that the essential stages of translation and cross-cultural adaptation of DiSI to the Portuguese language were satisfactorily fulfilled in this study.", "doi": "10.21470/1678-9741-2017-0141", "title": "Pre-validation Study of the Brazilian Version of the Disruptions in Surgery Index (DiSI) as a Safety Tool in Cardiothoracic Surgery.", "journal": ["Brazilian journal of cardiovascular surgery", "Braz J Cardiovasc Surg"]}
