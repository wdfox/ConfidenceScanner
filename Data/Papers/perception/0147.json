In this review, we will highlight and summarize the dissimilarities in prevalence of adverse food reactions, focusing on IgE-mediated food allergies and intolerances regarding frequency of symptoms and predisposing factors. After puberty, females suffer more frequently from food-related symptoms than males. Several factors may be responsible for this observation, for example hormonal effects, gender-specific behavior, perception of risk, or intake of medications. In this context, concrete studies related to adverse food reactions are still lacking.", "doi": "10.1186/s40413-017-0174-z", "title": "Adverse reactions to food: the female dominance - A secondary publication and update.", "journal": ["The World Allergy Organization journal", "World Allergy Organ J"]}
