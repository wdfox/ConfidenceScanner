Transcribed interviews were analysed using a text-condensing analytic approach.The analysis resulted in four main categories: (1) 'a renewed attitude towards physical activity', (2) 'a new perception of food', (3) 'mixed feelings of being in a heterogeneous treatment group' and (4) 'insight in one's own recovery process', each with 2-4 subcategories to express nuances.The treatment was experienced as beneficial.
