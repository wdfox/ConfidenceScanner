Computed tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) were done and showed an expanding lesion in the left anterior clinoid process encroaching upon the left orbital apex and optic nerve with features suggestive of a mucocele. Patient was started on dexamethasone, and urgent craniotomy was undertaken, where marsupialization and resection of left anterior clinoid mucocele was done, and histopathologic examination of the operative specimen was consistent with a mucocele. Post-operatively, patient was kept on dexamethasone for few days, with uneventful outcome, and his follow up at 6\u00a0months showed complete recovery of his vision from no light perception to 6/12 in the affected eye.", "doi": "10.1016/j.ensci.2017.05.005", "title": "Anterior clinoid mucocele causing optic neuropathy: A case report and review of literature.", "journal": ["eNeurologicalSci", "eNeurologicalSci"]}
