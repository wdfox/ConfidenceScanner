The objective of this research was to know and to understand end users' opinions as regards PH functionalities and the difficulties they have addressed while using the new PHR version. Research was based on a self administered survey, patient interviews and focus groups performed with out-patients. Topics examined: ways of access to the PHR log-in web page, frequency of use, type of device, most used functionalities, the different uses patients gave to PHR, perception as regards the redesign. This research allowed us to know the uses patients give to the PHR in this institution and to understand the difficulties they found in what refers to its re-design.
