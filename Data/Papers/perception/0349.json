In this study, in order to measure the aroma release from different individuals, eleven key aroma compounds of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) were monitored and quantified in dynamic headspace after an in-vitro interaction between EVOO and human saliva. Therefore, sixty individuals among normal weight (NW), overweight (OW), and obese (O) were studied.OW and O have higher release of C6 compounds in comparison to NW. On the contrary, NW have higher release of C5 compounds. Pentanal and hexanal increased after saliva interaction also in a refined olive oil (ROO), which is free from volatiles. Among saliva samples with the higher release in NW individuals, only pentanal resulted different. However, the low levels of these lipid oxidation end-products seem not to be very important to increase the odorous fat sensitivity.These results showed the important role of saliva in aroma release of EVOO, indicating that humans can differently perceive it in relation to their BMI.", "doi": "10.1002/jsfa.8848", "title": "EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL AROMA RELEASE AFTER INTERACTION WITH HUMAN SALIVA FROM INDIVIDUALS WITH DIFFERENT BODY MASS INDEX.", "journal": ["Journal of the science of food and agriculture", "J.
