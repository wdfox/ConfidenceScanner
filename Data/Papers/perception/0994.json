Preoperative and postoperative visual acuity, slit lamp and fundus examination, applanation tonometry, keratometry, biometry, optical coherence tomography, Scheimpflug imaging were done for extensive evaluation. Qualitative and quantitative data were summarized in the form of proportion and mean and standard deviation, respectively. The significance of difference was measured by Chi-square test or unpaired t-test or ANOVA whichever is appropriate. P < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.There was one case in which haptic broke during handshake maneuver and another IOL was required. Postoperative complications included corneal edema (4%), increased intraocular pressure (6%), cystoid macular edema (2%), decentration (4%), and dislocation (2%), which were all managed to the level of good visual recovery. There was no significant change in corneal astigmatism. There was significant change found in best-corrected visual acuity and uncorrected visual acuity after surgery.This modified technique seems to be a good alternative in IOL implantation in eyes with deficient capsules in view of the decrease in the learning time and surgical time and risk for complications.", "doi": "10.4103/ijo.IJO_620_17", "title": "Sutureless glueless intrascleral fixation of posterior chamber intraocular lens: Boon for aphakic.", "journal": ["Indian journal of ophthalmology", "Indian J Ophthalmol"]}
