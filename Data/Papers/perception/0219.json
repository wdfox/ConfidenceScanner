Chronic overeating of highly palatable foods is one of the main responsible aspects behind overweight. Food choice is driven by food preference, which is influenced by environmental and internal factors, from availability to rewarding properties of food. Consequently, the acquisition of a dietary habit that may lead to metabolic alterations is the result of a learning process in which many variables take place. From genetics to socioeconomic status, the response to food and how this food affects energy metabolism is heavily influenced, even before birth. In this work, we review how food preference is acquired and established, particularly as regards sweet taste; towards which flavors and tastes we are positively predisposed by our genetic background, our early experience, further lifestyle, and our surroundings; and, especially, the role that the endocannabinoid system (ECS) plays in all of this. Ultimately, we try to summarize why this system is relevant for health purposes and how this is linked to important aspects of eating behavior, as its function as a modulator of energy homeostasis affects, and is affected by, physiological responses directly associated with obesity.", "doi": "10.1093/chemse/bjx062", "title": "Role of Endocannabinoids on Sweet Taste Perception, Food Preference, and Obesity-related Disorders.", "journal": ["Chemical senses", "Chem.
