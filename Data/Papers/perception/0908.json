The existence of MAGIC syndrome suggests a potential common etiology for BD and RP. However, connecting these two diseases and referring to this condition as MAGIC syndrome might have been premature, as there is currently insufficient knowledge on BD and RP. In this critical review, we argue that these two clinical entities could possibly be unique disease processes rather than two ends of the same disease spectrum. Distinguishing the clinical difference between BD and RP is critical for the management of patients diagnosed with MAGIC syndrome, as biological therapeutic approaches for BD and RP differ. Also, inaccurate perception regarding the relationship of these two diseases could mislead researchers in their endeavors to unravel the pathophysiological mechanisms behind these two diseases.", "doi": "10.7759/cureus.1743", "title": "Breaking the Magic: Mouth and Genital Ulcers with Inflamed Cartilage Syndrome.", "journal": ["Cureus", "Cureus"]}
