We assessed whether standardised packaging could reduce the possibility of erroneous inferences of 'safety' drawn from NAS cigarette packaging.US adult smokers (n=909) were recruited to a between-subject survey experiment (3 brands\u00d73 packaging/labelling styles) through Amazon Mechanical Turk and rated their perception of whether a randomly assigned cigarette package conveyed that the brand was 'safer' on a three-item scale (Cronbach's \u03b1=0.92). We assessed whether NAS packs were rated higher on the 'implied safety' scale than two other brands and estimated the effect that plain packaging (ie, all branding replaced with a drab dark brown colour) and Australian-like packaging (ie, all branding replaced with a drab dark brown colour and a graphic image and text on 75% of the pack surface) had on perceptions of the NAS cigarette package.Smokers' ratings of the standard NAS pack on the implied safety scale (mean=4.6; SD=2.9) were 1.9 times (P\u2009<0.001) higher than smokers' ratings of a Marlboro Red pack (mean=2.4; SD=2.3) and 1.7 times (P\u2009<0.001) higher than smokers' ratings of a Newport Menthol pack (mean=2.7; SD=2.4). These perceptions of implied safety were lower when plain packaging was used (Cohen's d=0.66; P\u2009<0.001) and much lower when Australian-like packaging was used (Cohen's d=1.56; P\u2009<0.001).The results suggest that NAS cigarette packaging conveys that its cigarettes are 'safer' and that such perceptions are lower with standardised packaging, both with and without warning images.", "doi": "10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2017-053940", "title": "Standardised cigarette packaging may reduce the implied safety of Natural American Spirit cigarettes.", "journal": ["Tobacco control", "Tob Control"]}
