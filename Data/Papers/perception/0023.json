This paper focuses on the perception of the energy label for residential buildings in the Netherlands and the role of different frames (egoistic, biospheric and social norms and neutral frames) in motivating adoption of energy labels for housing. We used a behavioral email experiment and an online survey to investigate these motivational factors. We find that biospheric frames are weaker than the other three motivational frames in terms of engaging interest in the energy label, but that the biospheric frame results in higher willingness to pay (WTP) for the energy label. We also find that age (rather than income) correlates with higher WTP for home energy labels.", "doi": "10.1007/s10901-016-9500-y", "title": "Buildings behaving badly: a behavioral experiment on how different motivational frames influence residential energy label adoption in the Netherlands.", "journal": ["Journal of housing and the built environment : HBE", "J Hous Built Environ"]}
