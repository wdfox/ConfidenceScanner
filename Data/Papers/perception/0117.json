Pain was analyzed according to intensity and characteristics using the Saint Antoine Pain Questionnaire (French Mac Gill questionnaire). For statistical analysis, Student tests were performed.84% of patients experienced low to moderate pain, with a significantly higher intensity in women. Thirty-one per cent of patients consumed analgesics, although no established correlation was observed between intensity of pain and analgesics. For 53% of patients, duration of pain was \u2264\u20092\u2009days; for 15% of patients, the pain lasted 7\u2009days. Among patients aged \u2265\u200940\u2009years, duration of pain was significantly lower than in those aged <\u200940\u2009years. Ten characteristics of pain were selected as described by at least one third of patients.Orthodontic treatments with aligners cause mild to moderate pain, which usually lasts 2 to 3\u2009days, but may last 7\u2009days. This pain is described as a sensation of \"compression\", \"twinges\", \"squeezing\", \"tightness\", \"stretching\", \"cutting\", and as being \"tiresome\", \"bothersome\", \"unpleasant\", or even \"a nuisance\".", "doi": "10.1051/orthodfr/2017028", "title": "[Perception of pain in orthodontic treatment with thermoformed aligners].", "journal": ["L' Orthodontie francaise", "Orthod Fr"]}
