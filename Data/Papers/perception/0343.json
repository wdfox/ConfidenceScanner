This is a cross-sectional study, that detected a low prevalence of depression; light or moderate anxiety in 13% of the workers; self-perception of good health; life quality and good psychological capacity in most of the participants; poor sleep quality in half of them; reverse correlations between anxiety and life quality, and anxiety and psychological capital; positive correlations between psychological capital and life quality; associations between self-perception of health, time, and sleep quality; associations between anxiety and sleep duration and quality; and between alcohol consumption and location at work (front, rear, or variable). The results suggest vulnerabilities regarding anxiety and sleep quality. However, there is a potential coping of determinants that impact on mental health.", "doi": "10.1080/19338244.2017.1411329", "title": "Mental health in underground coal miners.", "journal": ["Archives of environmental & occupational health", "Arch Environ Occup Health"]}
