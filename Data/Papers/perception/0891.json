Questionnaire data were collected prior to group assignment and post intervention. Two-factor repeated-measures analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) were used to compare group outcomes.Upon completion, participants in the AgeWISE program reported increases in memory contentment and their sense of control in improving memory; no significant changes were observed in the control group. Surprisingly, participation in the group was not associated with significant changes in knowledge of memory aging, perception of memory ability, or greater use of strategies.The AgeWISE program was successfully implemented and increased participants' memory contentment and their sense of control in improving memory in advancing age.This study supports the use of AgeWISE to improve perspectives on healthy cognitive aging.", "doi": "10.1080/07317115.2017.1387212", "title": "The Aging Well through Interaction and Scientific Education (AgeWISE) Program.", "journal": ["Clinical gerontologist", "Clin Gerontol"]}
