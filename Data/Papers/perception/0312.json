The optimal partial adjustment of the refractive outcome of the first eye according to K was retrospectively analyzed using a regression formula.In all patients, the optimal partial adjustment of the refractive outcome of the first eye was calculated as 56%. For K values between 42.8 D and 44.6 D, the optimal partial adjustment was calculated as 30%; however, this adjustment of the first eye did not significantly improve the refractive outcome in the second eye of the subgroup with K values between 42.8 D and 44.6 D. For K values greater than 44.6 D or less than 42.8 D, the optimal partial adjustments were calculated as 69% and 81%, respectively. According to these results, the adjustment of the first eye significantly improved the refractive outcome in the second eye from 0.36 to 0.26 D (P\u2009<\u20090.001) in the entire data set. This result was significantly lower than that using a single partial adjustment (56%) (0.28 D; P\u2009=\u20090.027).For K values greater than 44.6 D or less than 42.8 D, an approximately 70-80% adjustment of the first eye error should be considered. In contrast, for K values between 42.8 D and 44.6 D, a 30% or less adjustment should be considered in the SRK/T formula.", "doi": "10.1186/s12886-017-0664-3", "title": "Influence of corneal power on intraocular lens power of the second eye in the SRK/T formula in bilateral cataract surgery.", "journal": ["BMC ophthalmology", "BMC Ophthalmol"]}
