Data were collected prospectively and anonymously.A total of 261 nephrologists and 172 patients participated in the survey. Sixty-six percent of patients reported a negative impact of the disease on their quality of life, which is also identified by nephrologists: important impact 22% vs 27%, mild or inconstant 44% vs 47%, mild or absent 34% vs 31% in patients and nephrologists, respectively. They had different perceptions about factors contributing to vital force; in particular, nephrologists underestimated their key role in psychological support. Indeed, the optimism and encouragements of nephrologists were considered to be a key factor of vital force for 60% of patients vs 20% of nephrologists (P<0,001). During consultations, nephrologists were primarily focused on biological abnormalities and adherence to treatment while mood or sexual disorders were rarely investigated. The main objective of treatment was to maintain a normal life for patients and to delay dialysis for nephrologists.Nephrologists have a relative knowledge of CKD impact on the vital impetus of patients, but there are differences of perception. It could be improved through specific trainings.", "doi": "10.1016/j.nephro.2017.10.002", "title": "[Discrepancies (and confluences) in perception between patients and nephrologists of chronic kidney disease impact on vital impetus in adults not undergoing hemodialysis: Results of the French MAEVA study].", "journal": ["Nephrologie & therapeutique", "Nephrol.
