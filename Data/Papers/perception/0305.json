The neural mechanism underlying the metacognitive function that reflects subjective perception still remains under debate. We have previously used decoded neurofeedback (DecNef) to demonstrate that manipulating the multivoxel activation patterns in the frontoparietal network modulates perceptual confidence without affecting perceptual performance. The results provided clear evidence for a dissociation between perceptual confidence and performance and suggested a distinct role of the frontoparietal network in metacognition.", "doi": "10.11477/mf.1416200929", "title": "[Modulation of Metacognition with Decoded Neurofeedback].", "journal": ["Brain and nerve = Shinkei kenkyu no shinpo", "Brain Nerve"]}
