I argue that they fail to differentiate between effects at three distinct levels of number perception\u00a0-\u00a0encoding, representations, and decision making\u00a0-\u00a0and that differentiating between these allows the number to be independent from, but correlated with, non-numeric dimensions.", "doi": "10.1017/S0140525X1600220X", "title": "The contributions of non-numeric dimensions to number encoding, representations, and decision-making factors.", "journal": ["The Behavioral and brain sciences", "Behav Brain Sci"]}
