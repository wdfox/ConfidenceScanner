Team exams are similar to midterm exams, except that answering questions is a team effort.Data was collected from second year pharmacy students at California Northstate University College of Pharmacy (CNUCOP) through a self-administered online survey. The survey questions included closed-ended questions to evaluate students' perception on preparedness for a summative assessment and to rank advantages and disadvantages of the team exams.Of the 40 students who completed the survey (38% response rate), 100% of participants agreed that having a team exam prior to a major exam made them feel more prepared for a major summative exam. Ninety-seven percent of students believed that the team exam helped them to identify gaps in their knowledge and 85% agreed that taking a team exam reinforced their knowledge by teaching other students. The survey results did not identify any major disadvantages to holding a team exam.Students perceived that taking a team exam prior to a midterm exam is an effective approach to review the course contents and identify areas of improvement.", "doi": "10.1016/j.cptl.2017.09.009", "title": "An innovative addition to team-based-learning pedagogy to enhance teaching and learning: Students' perceptions of team exams.", "journal": ["Currents in pharmacy teaching & learning", "Curr Pharm Teach Learn"]}
