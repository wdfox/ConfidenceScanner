The GCIPL thinning rate was determined in the global, superior, or inferior hemiretinas and in six macular sectors by linear regression and was compared between glaucomatous eyes with DH and fellow glaucomatous eyes without DH and between glaucomatous eyes with DH and non-DH glaucomatous control eyes.The GCIPL thinning rate (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) was significantly more rapid in glaucomatous eyes with DH than in fellow eyes without DH in the inferior hemiretina (-1.07 \u00b1 0.75 vs. -0.44 \u00b1 0.54 \u03bcm/y, P = 0.001), inferotemporal sector (-1.13 \u00b1 1.00 vs. -0.61 \u00b1 0.66 \u03bcm/y, P = 0.028), and inferior sector (-1.33 \u00b1 0.79 vs. -0.42 \u00b1 0.78 \u03bcm/y, P < 0.001). The GCIPL thinning rate was significantly more rapid in glaucomatous eyes with DH than in glaucomatous controls without DH in the global area (-0.78 \u00b1 0.85 vs. -0.32 \u00b1 0.48 \u03bcm/y, P = 0.002), the inferior hemiretina (-1.00 \u00b1 0.94 vs. -0.37 \u00b1 0.67 \u03bcm/y, P < 0.001), and the inferotemporal sector (-1.31 \u00b1 1.07 vs. -0.34 \u00b1 0.75 \u03bcm/y, P < 0.001).The GCIPL thinning rate on OCT was significantly more rapid in glaucomatous eyes with DH than in fellow glaucomatous eyes without DH or glaucomatous control eyes without DH. DH could be associated with progression of glaucoma in terms of GCIPL thinning.", "doi": "10.1167/iovs.17-22547", "title": "Evaluation of Ganglion Cell-Inner Plexiform Layer Thinning in Eyes With Optic Disc Hemorrhage: A Trend-Based Progression Analysis.", "journal": ["Investigative ophthalmology & visual science", "Invest.
