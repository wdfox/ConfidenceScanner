One of the mitochondrial variants responsible for HL is the m.7511T>C mutation located in the mitochondrially encoded tRNA serine 1 (UCN) gene. Next\u2011generation sequencing was used to search for the HL mutations in the whole mtDNA of 2\u00a0patients with maternal inheritance and real time\u2011polymerase chain reaction was applied for population screening of the m.7511T>C mutation in a group of 1,644\u00a0patients with HL. Sequencing of the whole mtDNA in 2 probands revealed a homoplasmic m.7511T>C mutation. Inheritance of the m.7511T>C mutation has been confirmed in examined matrilineal relatives in both families. The mean age of HL onset was 14.1\u00a0years old with the mean degree of HL equaling 74.8\u00a0dB. A large\u2011scale search for the m.7511T>C mutation among the patients with HL established the frequency of the m.7511T>C mutation at 0.12% among Polish patients with HL. In conclusion, this first report on central European patients harboring the m.7511T>C mutation reveals that the m.7511T>C may be important when diagnosing patients with maternally inherited HL.", "doi": "10.3892/mmr.2017.8064", "title": "Application of next\u2011generation sequencing to identify mitochondrial mutations: Study on m.7511T>C in patients with hearing loss.", "journal": ["Molecular medicine reports", "Mol Med Rep"]}
