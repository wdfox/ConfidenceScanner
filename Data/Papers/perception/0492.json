Twenty-four anisohypermetropic amblyopic eyes and their fellow eyes of 24 patients and twenty-three eyes of 23 age-matched control children were studied. After one year of optical correction, the BCVA in the anisohypermetropic amblyopic eyes was significantly improved. Before the treatment, the mean subfoveal CT in the amblyopic eyes was 351.9 \u00b1 59.4 \u03bcm which was significantly thicker than that of control eyes at 302.4 \u00b1 63.2 \u03bcm. After the treatment, the amount of change in the subfoveal CT in the amblyopic and fellow eyes was greater than that in the control eyes. The amblyopic and fellow eyes with thicker choroids had a greater thinning of the choroid whereas eyes with thinner choroids had a greater thickening of the choroid. We conclude that wearing corrective lenses improves the visual acuity, and induces changes of the subfoveal CT in eyes with anisohypermetropic amblyopia.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0189735", "title": "Effect of optical correction on subfoveal choroidal thickness in children with anisohypermetropic amblyopia.", "journal": ["PloS one", "PLoS ONE"]}
