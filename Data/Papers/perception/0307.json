This study describes patients' personal experiences of acne treatment. Video interviews were made of 27 teenagers and young adults with acne treated for 12 weeks with adapalene/benzoyl peroxide gel. Transcripts were then coded and qualitatively analyzed. Four thematic domains affecting quality of life and experience were identified: clinical manifestations, self-perception, social placement, and perception of control. Successful treatment increased self-esteem and performance at work and school. Successful acne treatment improves patients' quality of life by improving appearance and self-perception, satisfaction with social placement, and perception of control.", "doi": null, "title": "Characterization of Patients' Quality of Life and Experience in the Course of Acne Treatment.", "journal": ["Skinmed", "Skinmed"]}
