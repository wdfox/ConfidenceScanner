The purpose of this study is to develop and validate the 17-item Safe Patient Handling Perception Scale (SPHPS) as an evaluation instrument assessing perceptual risk of MSK injury based on SPH&M knowledge, practice, and resource accessibility in the workplace.Data were collected from a convenience sample (N = 117) of nursing employees at a Veteran Affairs Medical Center. Factor analysis identified three factors: knowledge, practice, and accessibility.The SPHPS demonstrated high levels of reliability, supported by acceptable alpha scores (SPHM knowledge [\u03b1 = .866], SPHM practices [\u03b1 = .901], and access to SPHM resources [\u03b1 = .855]), in addition to the relatively low standard error of measurement scores (SEM).The study outcomes suggest that the SPHPS is a valid and reliable tool that can measure participants' perceived risk factors for MSK injuries.", "doi": "10.1002/rnj.262", "title": "Examining the Factor Structure and Reliability of the Safe Patient Handling Perception Scale: An Initial Validation Study.", "journal": ["Rehabilitation nursing : the official journal of the Association of Rehabilitation Nurses", "Rehabil Nurs"]}
