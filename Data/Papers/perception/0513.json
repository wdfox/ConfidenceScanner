The Italian version of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life questionnaires C30 (core questionnaire), OG25 (esophago-gastric cancer module), and INFO25 (information module) were used.Candidates for palliative treatment were less informed about the disease (adjusted mean difference -\u200911.5, 95% CI -\u200923.0 to -\u20090.02) and less satisfied with information provided (adjusted mean difference -\u200918.3, 95% CI -\u200931.9 to -\u20094.7) than candidates for curative treatment. In addition, candidates for palliative treatment wanted to receive more information than candidates for curative treatment (adjusted mean difference 26.1, 95% CI 0.5 to 51.6). Better quality of life was associated with satisfaction of received information (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.77, p\u2009<\u20090.0001) and of receiving information about things that the patient can do to help himself (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.26, p\u2009=\u20090.04). More anxiety was associated to receiving more information about disease (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.46, p\u2009=\u20090.02) but less information about things that the patient can do to help himself (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.38, p\u2009=\u20090.02).Candidates for palliative treatment were less satisfied with information about the disease and wanted to receive more information. Additionally, some aspects of quality of life were found to be associated with perceived receipt of information. Appropriate training in communication of prognostic information may improve clinical management of incurable cancer patients.", "doi": "10.1007/s00520-017-4005-0", "title": "Potential curability and perception of received information in esophageal cancer patients.", "journal": ["Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer", "Support Care Cancer"]}
