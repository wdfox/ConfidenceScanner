The auditory system has shown capacity for plasticity into adulthood, allowing the perceptual discrimination abilities to be improved by training. It has been suggested that a certain form of passive learning using rapid sensory stimulation can lead to plasticity in the sensory cortex through mechanisms similar to long-term potentiation. Here we demonstrate using electroencephalography that brief rapid auditory stimulation (2\u202fmin, 13\u202fHz) with a sinusoidal tone (1025\u202fHz) led to increased discriminability of the stimulated tone from a standard tone (1000\u202fHz) as indexed by mismatch negativity event-related potential. This shows that perceptual learning with brief exposure can cause plastic changes similar to long-term training.", "doi": "10.1016/j.neulet.2017.12.035", "title": "Increased MMN amplitude following passive perceptual learning with LTP-like rapid stimulation.", "journal": ["Neuroscience letters", "Neurosci.
