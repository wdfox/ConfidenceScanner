The regulatory mechanism behind this convergence of PTI- and ETI-mediated defence gene induction remains elusive. We generated transgenic Arabidopsis plants that enable conditional NLR activation without pathogen infection to dissect NLR- and PRR-mediated transcriptional signals. A comparative analysis of over 40 transcriptome datasets linked calmodulin-binding transcription activators (CAMTAs) to the activation of overlapping defence genes in PTI and ETI. We used a dominant camta3 mutant (camta3-D) to assess CAMTA functions in the corresponding transcriptional regulation. Transcriptional regulation by NLRs, although highly similar to PTI responses, can be established independently of pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) perception, defence phytohormones and host cell death. Conditional expression of the N-terminal coiled-coil domain of the barley MLA (Mildew resistance locus A) NLR is sufficient to trigger similar transcriptional reprogramming as full-length NLRs. CAMTA-binding motifs are overrepresented in the 5' regulatory regions of the identified primary immune response genes, consistent with their altered expression and disease resistance responses in camta3-D plants. We propose that CAMTA-mediated transcriptional regulation defines an early convergence point in NLR- and PRR-mediated signalling.", "doi": "10.1111/nph.14943", "title": "A dominant-interfering camta3 mutation compromises primary transcriptional outputs mediated by both cell surface and intracellular immune receptors in Arabidopsis thaliana.", "journal": ["The New phytologist", "New Phytol."]}
