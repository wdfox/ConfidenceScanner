They were divided into 37 cases of healthy, normal subjects and 69 cases of nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) with DME. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography was done for all cases and analyzed to measure SFCT and central foveal thickness (CFT).The SFCT was significantly thinner in the DME group (193.4 \u03bcm) than in the control group (282.6 \u03bcm) (P = .001). In the DME group, SFCT was significantly related to CFT and vision (P < .05). The cutoff point for the relationship between SFCT and vision was 228 \u03bcm below the point at which vision is affected.DME is associated with a significant decrease in SFCT. SFCT is directly related to vision and foveal thickness, but it is inversely correlated to age.
