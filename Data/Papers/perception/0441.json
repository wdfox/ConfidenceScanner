Insight into the nursing students' experiences and baseline data related to their perception of peer tutoring will assist to improve nursing education.Q methodology was applied to explore the students' perspectives of peer tutoring in the simulation laboratory.A convenience P-sample of 40 baccalaureate nursing students was used.Fifty-eight selected Q statements from each participant were classified into the shape of a normal distribution using an 11-point bipolar scale form with a range from -5 to +5. PQ Method software analyzed the collected data.Three discrete factors emerged: Factor I (\"Facilitate or empower\" knowledge acquisition), Factor II (\"Safety Net\" Support environment), and Factor III (\"Mentoring\" learn how to learn).The findings of this study support and indicate that peer tutoring is an effective supplementary strategy to promote baccalaureate students' knowledge acquisition, establishing a supportive safety net and facilitating their abilities to learn in the simulation laboratory.", "doi": "10.1016/j.nedt.2017.12.001", "title": "Baccalaureate nursing students' perspectives of peer tutoring in simulation laboratory, a Q methodology study.", "journal": ["Nurse education today", "Nurse Educ Today"]}
