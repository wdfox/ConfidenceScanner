Objects reachable with the aid of a tool were perceived to be smaller than identical objects without a tool. Participants' responses to questioning rule out demand characteristics as an explanation. This new size illusion may reflect a direct impact of tool use on perceived size, or it may stem from the effects of tool use on perceived distance. Both possibilities support action specific accounts of perception.", "doi": "10.1016/j.actpsy.2017.12.003", "title": "Tool use produces a size illusion revealing action-specific perceptual mechanisms.", "journal": ["Acta psychologica", "Acta Psychol (Amst)"]}
