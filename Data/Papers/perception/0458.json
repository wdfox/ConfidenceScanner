It is recognized by health professionals as well as by lay people, although often with a different meaning. Wheezing is an indicator of airway obstruction and therefore of interest particularly for the assessment of young children and in other situations where objective documentation of lung function is not generally available. This review summarizes our current understanding of mechanisms producing wheeze, its subjective perception and description, its objective measurement, and visualization, and its relevance in clinical practice.", "doi": "10.1002/ppul.23930", "title": "The highs and lows of wheezing: A review of the most popular adventitious lung sound.", "journal": ["Pediatric pulmonology", "Pediatr.
