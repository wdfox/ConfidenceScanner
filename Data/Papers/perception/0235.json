Only 48\u00a0% of patients thought that the effectiveness and safety of generic were identical to the brand-name, 50\u00a0% had a favorable opinion and 36\u00a0% said they routinely accept substitution, especially when substitution was proposed by the general practitioner (68\u00a0% of patients). Age, gender, occupational status and the presence of a chronic condition were not associated to acceptance of substitution (P>0, 1), unlike the opinion (P<0.001), perception of efficacy (P<0.001) and side effects (P=0.0005). Two thirds of physicians substituted more than 50\u00a0% of their brand name prescription to generics. This low figure was due to patient request not to substitute (63.9\u00a0%).The acceptance of substitution was independently associated to patient' opinion about generic drugs, further emphasizing the need for information campaigns dedicated to patients.", "doi": "10.1016/j.revmed.2017.11.009", "title": "[Prospective study of the factors associated with the acceptance of generics substitution by patients and their liberal doctors].", "journal": ["La Revue de medecine interne", "Rev Med Interne"]}
