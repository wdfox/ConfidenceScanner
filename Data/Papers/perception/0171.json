Core Outcome Sets (COSs) are currently developed in different medical fields to standardize and improve the selection of outcome-domains, and measurement instruments in clinical trials, to make trial results meaningful, to pool trial results, and to allow indirect comparison between interventions. The objective of this study was to develop a COS of patient-relevant outcome-domains for chronic pain in IMPT clinical trials. An international, multi-professional panel (patient representatives (n=5), physicians specialized in pain medicine (n=5), physiotherapists (n=5), clinical psychologists (n=5), and methodological researchers (n=5)) was recruited for a 3-stage consensus study, which consisted of a mixed-method approach comprising an exploratory systematic review, a preparing online survey to identify important outcome-domains, a face-to-face consensus meeting to agree on COS domains, and a second online survey (Delphi) establishing agreement on definitions for the domains included. The panel agreed on the following eight domains to be included into the COS for IMPT: pain intensity, pain frequency, physical activity, emotional wellbeing, satisfaction with social roles and activities, productivity (paid and unpaid, at home and at work, inclusive presentism and absenteeism), health-related quality of life, and patient's perception of treatment goal achievement. The complexity of chronic pain in a biopsychosocial context is reflected in the current recommendation, and includes physical, mental and social outcomes. In a subsequent step measurement instruments will be identified via systematic reviews.", "doi": "10.1097/j.pain.0000000000001129", "title": "Developing a core outcome-domain set to assessing effectiveness of interdisciplinary multimodal pain therapy: the VAPAIN consensus statement on core outcome-domains.", "journal": ["Pain", "Pain"]}
