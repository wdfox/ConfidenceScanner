To investigate this question, we sought commonalities between experimentally-induced fear via electric shocks and pre-existing phobia. Using functional MRI, we tested the effect of fear-conditioning pictures of dogs in 21 spider-fearful participants across three phases: baseline, post-conditioning, and extinction. Considering phobic stimuli as a reference point for the state of fear allowed us to examine whether fear-conditioning renders information patterns of previously neutral stimuli more similar to those of phobic stimuli. We trained a classification algorithm to discriminate information patterns of neutral stimuli (rats) and phobic stimuli and then tested the algorithm on information patterns from the conditioned stimuli (dogs). Performing this cross-decoding analysis at each experimental phase revealed brain regions in which dogs were classified as rats during baseline, as spiders following conditioning, and again as rats after extinction. A follow-up analysis showed that changes in visual perception information cannot explain the changing classification performance. These results demonstrate a common neural representation for processing fear-eliciting information, either pre-existing or acquired by classical conditioning.", "doi": "10.1093/scan/nsx147", "title": "Relating experimentally-induced fear to pre-existing phobic fear in the human brain.", "journal": ["Social cognitive and affective neuroscience", "Soc Cogn Affect Neurosci"]}
