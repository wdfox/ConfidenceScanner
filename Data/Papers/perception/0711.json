To characterize the urinary odor kinetics after consumption of asparagus spears, we conducted a study with consenting attendees from two American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (ASCPT) meetings. Subjects were randomized to eat a specific number of asparagus spears, and then asked to report their urinary odor perception. Eighty-seven subjects were included in the final analysis. A mixed effect proportional odds model was developed that adequately characterized the dose-response relationship. We estimated the half-life of the asparagus effect on malodorous urine to be 4.7 hours (relative standard error (RSE)\u2009=\u200913.2%), and identified a dose-response slope term with good precision (24.3%). Age was found as the predictor of IIV in slope estimates. This study design and tools can be used as a demonstration \"crowdsourcing\" project for studying population kinetics in organizational and educational settings.", "doi": "10.1002/psp4.12264", "title": "Crowdsourced Asparagus Urinary Odor Population Kinetics.", "journal": ["CPT: pharmacometrics & systems pharmacology", "CPT Pharmacometrics Syst Pharmacol"]}
