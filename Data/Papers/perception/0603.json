However, a recent article highlighted some negative consequences that may arise from using ML decision support in medicine. We argue here that whilst the concerns raised by the authors may be appropriate, they are not specific to ML, and thus the article may lead to an adverse perception about this technique in particular. Whilst ML is not without its limitations like any methodology, a balanced view is needed in order to not hamper its use in potentially enabling better patient care.", "doi": "10.12688/f1000research.12693.1", "title": "Unintended consequences of machine learning in medicine?", "journal": ["F1000Research", "F1000Res"]}
