A radiograph is composed by about 100 gradations of grey, of which the human eye cannot resolve more than 30. Projection radiography has a cardinal problem: the superposition of normal and pathological structures. Apart from visual physiology, visual psychology plays an essential role in diagnosis: expectation and stereotyped thinking influence the interpretation of visual perception. X-ray findings are to be compared with anamnesis, laboratory values, clinical data and always with good judgement - this was already known in 1913. Plato sketched a cave analogy that describes the difficulties of interpreting \"shadows\" - with very interesting parallels to radiology.", "doi": "10.1055/s-0043-115713", "title": "[Radiology in the Light of Evolutionary Cognitive Theory].", "journal": ["Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift (1946)", "Dtsch.
