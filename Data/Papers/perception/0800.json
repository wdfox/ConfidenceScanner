Insufficient attention has been given to nuances in the types of CI. Using a two-group pretest-posttest quasi-experimental design, this study assessed two forms of CI, information-only (IO) and service learning (SL), on drinking perceptions, drinking behavior, and protective behaviors. When the entire sample was considered, CI significantly improved participants' drinking perceptions and behavior. SL was more effective than IO for one measure of drinking behavior and for protective behaviors. Interestingly, there was a greater decrease in men's drinking behavior and increase in women's protective behaviors in the SL group. This study may help guide health professionals, educators, and faculty members interested in developing alcohol-focused CI programs.", "doi": "10.1177/0047237917744328", "title": "Let's Get Involved!
