A quiz on this material was given on the first day of each course. This score was correlated with the final exam score at course completion. Additional student and faculty feedback was collected through surveys.2372 quiz-exam pairings were collected over three consecutive fall semesters. A one point increase in the quiz score was associated with a 3.6 point (95% confidence interval 3.1-4.0) higher exam score, as well as a greater probability of passing the exam (P<0.0001). Furthermore, simple linear regression revealed a positive correlation between quiz and exam scores (P<0.0001). Three full years of student survey data revealed an overwhelmingly positive perception of the OPR tutorials, and surveyed faculty reported better use of class time and improved student competency and participation.Implementation of OPR tutorials may give faculty more efficient use of class time, and their associated quizzes serve as an early indicator for students at-risk of not passing who are candidates for early interventions. Furthermore, the OPR tutorial design gives it great transferability to biomedical post-graduate programs.", "doi": "10.1016/j.cptl.2016.11.012", "title": "Forecasting academic success through implementation of an online prerequisite review tutorials program for first year pharmacy students.", "journal": ["Currents in pharmacy teaching & learning", "Curr Pharm Teach Learn"]}
