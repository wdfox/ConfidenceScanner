However, under current Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services guidelines, SBRT in the United States (US) is reimbursed for only \u22645 fractions, whereas there are no such restrictions for reimbursement in Canada. We hypothesize that US-specific SBRT reimbursement policies influence the use of \u22655-fraction SBRT in US academic centers in comparison with comparable Canadian centers.A 15-question electronic survey was distributed to radiation oncologists at National Cancer Institute-designated cancer centers in the US and the 10 highest research-funded cancer centers in Canada. Fisher exact test or exact logistic regression if applicable was used, where P<.05 was considered statistically different from neutral.Of the 143 radiation oncologists from 60 US cancer centers and 6 Canadian cancer centers who completed the survey (17.6% response rate), 125 routinely prescribe SBRT. Fifty percent of US physicians versus 0% of Canadian physicians indicated that there are instances when they would like to prescribe >5-fraction SBRT but prescribe \u22645 fractions because of insurance reimbursement (P=.076 and P=.001, respectively). Seventy percent (P=.006) of US radiation oncologists versus 0% (P=.001) of Canadian radiation oncologists report that SBRT clinical investigation is constrained by the insurance reimbursement. The most common reported deterrent to prescribing >5-fraction SBRT in the US was insurance reimbursement (49.5%).US radiation oncologists are more likely than those in Canada to report that SBRT clinical investigation and >5-fraction SBRT use may be negatively influenced by health insurance reimbursement; this perception was not held by physicians in Canada. Health care environment may significantly affect radiation therapy decision making and practice patterns.", "doi": "10.1016/j.ijrobp.2017.06.2447", "title": "The Influence of Health Insurance Policy on Radiation Oncology Physician SBRT/SABR Use Practices: A North American Survey.", "journal": ["International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics", "Int.
