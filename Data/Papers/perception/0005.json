The dimensions of illness perception were related to socio-economic status (SES). Symptoms of \"loose or separating teeth\" and \"pus in your tooth\" were associated with dental caries by low SES participants, while \"bleeding while brushing, flossing or eating hard food\" and \"mild to sharp pain when eating or drinking something sweet, hot or cold\" were related more to higher SES.Perceptions of caries were related to socioeconomic status. Interventions to promote health literacy in order to improve the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic oral health information could increase an early detection of caries.", "doi": "10.1922/CDH_4098Mafla07", "title": "Illness perceptions amongst individuals with dental caries.", "journal": ["Community dental health", "Community Dent Health"]}
