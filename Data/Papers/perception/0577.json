Newborns who underwent neonatal eye screening using the RetCam system (Clarity Medical Systems, Pleasanton, CA) at the authors' hospital from March 2010 to February 2014 were included.Of the 15,284 full-term infants who participated in the program, 21% (3,171 of 15,284) had some ocular abnormalities. Among these abnormalities, retinal hemorrhage was the most frequent finding, accounting for 19% (2,899 of 15,284) of all cases. Other anomalies were found in 2% (272 of 15,284) of the cases. No major ocular or systemic complications were found to be associated with the screening process.Overall, 21% of the newborns who underwent the eye screening program were found to have an abnormality. The use of the RetCam for the screening program was both efficient and safe in identifying ocular anomalies.
