In the quest to understand the neural bases of the modulatory prospective signals that prioritize and select relevant events during perception, one fundamental dimension has until recently been largely overlooked: time. In this Review, we introduce the burgeoning field of temporal attention and illustrate how the brain makes use of various forms of temporal regularities in the environment to guide adaptive behaviour and influence neural processing.", "doi": "10.1038/nrn.2017.141", "title": "Anticipated moments: temporal structure in attention.", "journal": ["Nature reviews.
