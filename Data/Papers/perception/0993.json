Pupilloplasty was performed in 3 cases whereas aniridia glued IOL fixation was done in 1 case that had total avulsion and loss of iris tissue. The main outcome measures were best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), intraoperative and postoperative complications during the entire follow-up period.The preoperative vision ranged from hand movement to perception of light in all the patients. The mean postoperative BCVA was 0.42 \u00b1 0.21 Snellen's decimal equivalent (SDE) at final follow-up. Postoperatively, all the cases retained good visual acuity with case 1 and case 2 reporting 0.5 SDE, case 3 had 0.33 SDE, case 5 had 0.67 SDE whereas case 4 had a final visual acuity limited to 0.1 SDE due to associated corneal opacity. The mean follow-up period was 20.2 \u00b1 11.7 months (range from 9 months to 36 months). The IOL was well centered, all the wounds were well apposed and the mean postoperative intraocular pressure was 14.6 \u00b1 1.95 mm Hg. No complications were reported in the entire follow-up period.The clinical outcomes of management of pseudophacocele were encouraging with retention of reasonably good visual potential in all cases.", "doi": "10.4103/ijo.IJO_1068_17", "title": "Clinical outcomes in traumatic pseudophacocele: A rare clinical entity.", "journal": ["Indian journal of ophthalmology", "Indian J Ophthalmol"]}
