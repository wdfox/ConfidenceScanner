We report a new technique and a practical approach that involves the placement of a spatula beneath the iris tissue that facilitates retroiridial removal of subluxated lens and acts as a scaffold by protecting the iris tissue from being accidentally trapped into the vitrectomy cutter port. Our technique facilitates management of the lens and vitreous without any trauma to the iris and secondarily obviates the need to perform an iris repair procedure that may arise due to iatrogenic reasons.", "doi": "10.4103/ijo.IJO_601_17", "title": "Spatula scaffold: An iris-sparing technique for lensectomy.", "journal": ["Indian journal of ophthalmology", "Indian J Ophthalmol"]}
