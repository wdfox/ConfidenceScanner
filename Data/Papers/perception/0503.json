They are concerned about HIV infection and may be subjected to the risk of suicidal ideation if they become infected, due to stress and discrimination. During 2005-2006, we recruited 199 IDUFSW who self-reported negative/unknown HIV sero-status in Dazhou, Sichuan, China, to investigate the prevalence of and factors associated with suicidal ideation if they became HIV positive. Among the participants, 40.7% responded affirmatively to the question \"Whether you would commit suicide if you were infected with HIV in the future?\" In multivariate analyses, hatred toward oneself, perception of dying within 2-3\u00a0years, perceived nonavailability of HIV-related treatment, inability to cope with HIV-related trauma, and inclination to leave one's family if one contracted HIV were significant factors related to anticipated suicidal ideation under the hypothetical situation of HIV infection. The odds ratios (OR) ranged from 2.38 to 10.36 (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05). These findings can facilitate the planning of primary suicidal prevention services targeting high-risk, non-HIV-positive IDUFSW. Such programs may enhance psychosocial support, empowerment, cultivation of positive coping strategies, and perceived accessibility to treatment, and be integrated with HIV testing.", "doi": "10.1080/03630242.2017.1353571", "title": "Anticipated suicidal ideation among female injecting drug users who are sex workers of negative or unknown HIV status in China.", "journal": ["Women & health", "Women Health"]}
