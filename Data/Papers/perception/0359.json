Research into the self-concept of children with cerebral palsy (CP) has been sparse due to the lack of a population-specific self-concept instrument. Using the new myTREEHOUSE Self-Concept Assessment, this study investigated the self-concept of children with CP in relation to age, gender, motor, communication and cognitive function. Children with CP aged 8-12 years (n\u202f=\u202f50; 29 males; mean 10 years 2 months; GMFCS-E&R I\u202f=\u202f36, II\u202f=\u202f8, III\u202f=\u202f5, IV\u202f=\u202f1) completed myTREEHOUSE and a standardised intelligence measure. Most children reported positive self-concept from all three myTREEHOUSE Performance Perspectives and over half (60%) fell within the Low range for the Personal Concern Score. Self-concept was not associated with age, gender, motor function, or communication function. However, for cognitive function, associations were observed for Social Skills (Below Average\u202f>\u202fAverage cognitive function; Cohen's d\u202f=\u202f1.07) and Learning Skills (Above Average\u202f>\u202fAverage cognitive function; Cohen's d\u202f=\u202f0.95) domains when rated from a Personal Performance Perspective. As the first study of the self-concept of children with CP using a CP-specific assessment, this study offers important insights into what children with CP think about themselves. Generally, the self-concept of children with CP was sound. Future research on environmental facilitators and barriers to robust self-concept development is recommended.", "doi": "10.1016/j.ridd.2017.12.001", "title": "Self-concept of children with cerebral palsy measured using the population-specific myTREEHOUSE Self-Concept Assessment.", "journal": ["Research in developmental disabilities", "Res Dev Disabil"]}
