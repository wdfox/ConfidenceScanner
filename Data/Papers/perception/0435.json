The present study evaluated the variability of the respiratory symptoms in a day and their influence on the daily activities in a cohort of Chinese COPD patients.An observational cross-sectional study was conducted in 11 medical centers of China. Participants were outpatient \u226540 years old with stable COPD, post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) <80% predicted. Overall, data of 1,032 eligible patients were valid for final analysis.Mean post bronchodilator FEV1 (predicted %) was 46.5%. Cough, expectoration and dyspnea were the most commonly observed symptoms (73.6%, 68.8% and 61.4%, respectively). Daily symptom variability was experienced by 50.2% of symptomatic patients. The wake up time in the morning was the worst and the most troublesome time during the day (39.3%), followed by the nighttime (21.3%). The morning activities were most affected by COPD symptoms. Multivariate analyses revealed that COPD assessment test (CAT) scores was the only factor correlated with patients' symptom variability [odds ratio (OR) =0.463, P<0.0001].Patient-perceived symptoms vary during the day in Chinese COPD patients. They experience the greatest increase in respiratory symptoms early in the morning. This variation should be considered as a potential new target in the long-term COPD management.", "doi": "10.21037/jtd.2017.08.131", "title": "Perception of circadian variation of symptoms in Chinese patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.", "journal": ["Journal of thoracic disease", "J Thorac Dis"]}
