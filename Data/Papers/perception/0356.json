Aim To investigate the perception and practices of nomadic Fulani women toward their children's oral health. Methodology A cross-sectional study was conducted among 197 Fulani women using a structured interviewer administered questionnaire. Results Perceived causes of tooth decay included tooth germs/worms (23.9%) and sugar (5.1%), and 32.0%, 15.2%, and 5.1%, respectively, self-medicated children with antibiotics, traditional concoctions/herbs, and analgesics for tooth decay. Two fifths (40.1%) attributed bleeding gums to tooth germs/worms. Polyurethane foam (46.7%), toothbrush (32.0%), finger (18.8%), and wooden twigs (2.5%) were aids used for cleaning children's teeth. Conclusions These mothers have suboptimal oral health knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward their children's oral health. There is a need for urgent intervention among this group of people.", "doi": "10.1177/0272684X17749562", "title": "Perception and Practices of Nomadic Women in a Rural Community in Southwestern Nigeria to Their Children's Oral Health.", "journal": ["International quarterly of community health education", "Int Q Community Health Educ"]}
