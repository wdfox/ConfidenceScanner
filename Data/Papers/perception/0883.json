The study sample consisted of more females (92%) than males (8%). being overwhelmed and inconvenient/tiresome followed by family adjustments and work adjustment 72 and 68% respectively for each were the experiences mostly highlighted by the parents/caregivers in this study. When it came to the needs of the parents/caregivers more than half of them needed help with caring. To this effect participants expressed their perception; one mother had this to say, \"\u2026I need someone to help in caring. Sometimes I need to do some other things but can't, because if I do then no one will remain with the child\u2026\".This study point out to some evidence that the burden inflicted on those caring for children with cerebral palsy should be addressed if the quality of care for those with cerebral palsy is to be improved.", "doi": "10.1186/s13104-017-3011-0", "title": "Caring for a cerebral palsy child: a caregivers perspective at the University Teaching Hospital, Zambia.", "journal": ["BMC research notes", "BMC Res Notes"]}
