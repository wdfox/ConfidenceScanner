We argue that two different cultural norms must be considered: (1) the importance of emotional disclosure and (2) attitudes toward seeking support from loved ones. Our interviews with 37 foreign-born Chinese American and 23 European American breast cancer survivors revealed differences in disclosure of cancer diagnosis and perception of social support. Both Chinese American and European American survivors receive and provide emotional and social support with loved ones, but their manifestations of disclosure and help-seeking behaviors are culturally specific.", "doi": "10.1177/1359105317745967", "title": "Talking about cancer: Explaining differences in social support among Chinese American and European American breast cancer survivors.", "journal": ["Journal of health psychology", "J Health Psychol"]}
