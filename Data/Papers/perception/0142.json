The interest in natural colourants, especially \u03b2-carotene that not only imparts colour but also has well-documented health benefits, has triggered the research and development of different protocols designed to entrap these hydrophobic natural molecules to improve their stability against oxidation. Here, we report a versatile microfluidic approach that uses single emulsion droplets as templates to prepare microparticles loaded with natural colourants. The solution of \u03b2-carotene and shellac in the solvent is emulsified by microfluidics into droplets. Upon solvent diffusion, \u03b2-carotene and shellac co-precipitates, forming solid microparticles of \u03b2-carotene dispersed in the shellac polymer matrix. We substantially improve the stability of \u03b2-carotene that is protected from oxidation by the polymer matrix and achieve different colour appearances by loading particles with different \u03b2-carotene concentrations. These particles demonstrate great promise for practical use in natural food colouring.", "doi": "10.1098/rsos.170919", "title": "Dispersing hydrophobic natural colourant \u03b2-carotene in shellac particles for enhanced stability and tunable colour.", "journal": ["Royal Society open science", "R Soc Open Sci"]}
