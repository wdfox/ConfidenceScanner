Children and adolescents, 6 to 17\u00a0years old, with a vitreous haze score of \u22651.5+ or cystoid macular edema (CME) of >300\u00a0\u03bcm were enrolled. Vitreous haze score at month 2 was chosen as primary endpoint. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central retinal thickness (CRT) and concomitant medication at month 6 were defined as secondary endpoints. Intraocular pressure (IOP) and cataract formation were determined as safety endpoints.Three out of 6 eligible patients participated in the case series. At month 2, vitreous haze was reduced from a score of 1.5+ to 0.5+ and 0 and BCVA improved by \u22653 lines, \u22654 lines and \u22652 lines of Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy (ETDRS)-letters, respectively. Visual acuity gain was accompanied by a CRT reduction of -186\u00a0\u03bcm and -83\u00a0\u03bcm in the first and third patient, in whom CME was the indication for DEX implantation. A reduction of concomitant medication was achieved in 1 patient. IOP increase was seen in all 3 patients, but could be treated sufficiently with primarily IOP lowering medications and without need for glaucoma surgery. Cataract progression did not occur.DEX implants led to an improvement in all endpoints, especially BCVA. This study confirms that IOP rises may also occur in the paediatric population and should be monitored and treated appropriately.European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials (EudraCT)- nr: 2013-000541-39.", "doi": "10.1186/s12886-017-0648-3", "title": "Dexamethasone implants in paediatric patients with noninfectious intermediate or posterior uveitis: first prospective exploratory case series.", "journal": ["BMC ophthalmology", "BMC Ophthalmol"]}
