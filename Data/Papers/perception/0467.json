Female rugby players were instructed to walk, walk with the ball, or run with the ball along a path toward a goal while avoiding three obstacles (three vertical poles or two vertical poles and a confederate) placed halfway along the path, creating two equal apertures of 80\u00a0cm. Regardless of the form of locomotion, rugby players chose paths furthest from the confederate, suggesting that confederate location affects path selection. Furthermore, medial-lateral spatial requirements were more variable when participants were walking without the ball than while moving with the ball. Avoidance behaviors, but not path selection, appear to be impacted and minimized during sport-specific movements.", "doi": "10.1123/mc.2017-0043", "title": "The Effects of Obstacle Type and Locomotion Form on Path Selection in Rugby Players.", "journal": ["Motor control", "Motor Control"]}
