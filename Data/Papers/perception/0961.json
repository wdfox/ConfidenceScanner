Our aim is not a complex overview about HLP and DLP. We just want to describe the changing position and importance of these diseases in clinical medicine. We will touch cardiology, angiology, but also diabetology, hepatology and gastroenterology (pancreas). HLP and DLP, which started as a research topic in laboratory became clinically interesting as risk factors of atherosclerosis. They are understood as epidemic occurrence diseases, also in connection with metabolic syndrome. However, some of them, e.g. familial chylomicronemia or homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia fulfill criteria of rare diseases.", "doi": null, "title": "[Hyperlipoprotienemias and (not only) atherosclerosis: fragments from history and present].", "journal": ["Casopis lekaru ceskych", "Cas.
