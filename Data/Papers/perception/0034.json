The authors also used Cronbach's alpha test to assess the internal consistency of both questionnaires and the Mann-Whitney test to evaluate the significance of gender differences in both questionnaires.The HSE-IT highlighted the existence of work-related stress in all the population with a critical perception regarding the domain \"Relationships.\" Furthermore, gender analysis highlighted the presence of two additional domains in the female population: \"Demand\" (p = 0,002) and \"Support from Managers\" (p = 0,287). The WHO-5 highlighted a well-being level below the standard cut-off point with a significant gender difference (p = 0.009) for males (18,\u2009SD = 6) as compared to females (14,\u2009SD = 6,4). Cronbach's alpha values indicated a high level of internal consistency for both of our scales.The risk assessment of quality of working life should take into due account the individual characteristics of workers, with special attention to gender.", "doi": "10.1155/2017/7340781", "title": "Quality of Life in Workers and Stress: Gender Differences in Exposure to Psychosocial Risks and Perceived Well-Being.", "journal": ["BioMed research international", "Biomed Res Int"]}
