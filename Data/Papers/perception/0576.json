The authors report herein a method to remove larger pieces of retained nuclear material during vitrectomy surgery with a retractable basket made from nitinol referred to as the \"Frag Bag\" (patent pending). Although originally designed for cystoscopic removal of kidney stones, this instrument fits easily through a 23-gauge vitrectomy port. The basket allows for retrieval of larger pieces of retained nuclear material with stabilization of the lens material in the mid-vitreous cavity and softening of the nuclear material to allow efficient and safe removal with the vitreous cutter, away from the retinal surface. Use of the Frag Bag may potentially improve the safety and efficiency of a pars plana lensectomy by obviating the need for a phacofragmatome and decreasing the number of times instruments are brought close to the retinal surface.
