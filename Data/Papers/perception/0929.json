After a brief description of different categories of temporal experiences, the article describes how research on psychological time falls within a psychophysical perspective. Next, some factors changing sensitivity to time or perceived duration are reported. Four main sources affecting this sensitivity are identified : the modality in which the intervals to be estimated are marked, the length of the markers, the number of intervals presented, and whether people are counting explicitly or not when estimating time. When emphasis is placed on the perceived duration of intervals, 3 important factors of influence are retained: attention, the space between markers and emotion and its expression. The biological bases required for processing temporal information are then briefly reviewed, and the article ends with the description of perturbations of the relation to time in some pathologies (schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease and depression).
