The present study investigates the neurophysiological correlates of the competition between gesture representations during object perception. 3D conflictual objects (distinct structural and functional gestures) and non-conflictual objects (similar structural and functional gestures) were presented in three spaces (peripersonal, boundary of peripersonal, and extrapersonal) in a virtual environment. Participants performed reach-to-grasp and semantic judgments on objects while EEG was recorded. Results revealed that the conflict between evoked gestures impacts 8-12\u202fHz desynchronization at both central (\u03bc rhythm) and posterior (\u03b1 rhythm) sites. Critically, \u03bc rhythm desynchronization was suppressed when conflictual objects were presented in peripersonal space. Findings indicate that \u03bc rhythm desynchronization is reduced by the competition between evoked gestures and suggest that neural motor resonance may also reflect action selection processes during object perception.", "doi": "10.1016/j.biopsycho.2017.12.004", "title": "Conflict between gesture representations extinguishes \u03bc rhythm desynchronization during manipulable object perception: An EEG study.", "journal": ["Biological psychology", "Biol Psychol"]}
