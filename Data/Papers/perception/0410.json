The mean age was 23.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018.6 years. Three patients presented with blunt trauma, while one patient had a ruptured globe. Presenting visual acuity (VA) was hand motions in three of the patients and no light perception in the fourth patient. All patients were diagnosed with traumatic glaucoma and treated with glaucoma medications during their follow-up. Two patients received tube shunts to control intraocular pressures (IOPs). At the time of most recent follow-up, three patients had elevated IOPs and were not on any medications. VA at the last follow-up was 20/400 or worse.Traumatic glaucoma can be managed with surgical and medical interventions, while VA usually does not return to baseline levels prior to the injury. Prognostic predictors can be used to guide treatment and identify patients who should be closely followed. Because the presentation and onset is widely variable, follow-up and screening is crucial even years after the injury.", "doi": "10.1016/j.joco.2017.06.006", "title": "Traumatic glaucoma due to paintball injuries: A case series.", "journal": ["Journal of current ophthalmology", "J Curr Ophthalmol"]}
