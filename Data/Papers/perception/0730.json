The General Practitioner (GP) is the main health professional attending to these patients. The aim of this study was to examine the GPs' perception on managing patients with chronic depression.We performed an explorative cross-sectional study with a systematic sample of GPs in central Germany. Source of data was a written questionnaire (46 items). Descriptive analysis was carried out.Two hundred twenty (out of 1000; 22%) GPs participated. 93% of the GPs distinguish between care for patients with chronic depression and acute depressive episode. 92% would recommend psychotherapeutic co-treatment to the chronically depressed patient. 52% of GPs would favour a general restraint on antidepressants (ADs) in older chronically depressed patients (\u2265 75\u00a0years) whereas 40% suggest long-term pharmacotherapy. If severe physical comorbidity is present GPs would be restrictive in prescribing ADs (65%) or would urgently refer to specialist psychiatric services (40%). In case of a comorbid anxiety disorder 66% of the GPs would suggest a combined psycho- und pharmacotherapy. If a substance use disorder coexists 84% would prefer urgent referrals to specialist services.Participating GPs report awareness towards chronic depression in their patients. Physical and mental comorbidity seem to play an important role in GPs' treatment decisions.", "doi": "10.1186/s12888-017-1564-z", "title": "German general practitioners' self-reported management of patients with chronic depression.", "journal": ["BMC psychiatry", "BMC Psychiatry"]}
