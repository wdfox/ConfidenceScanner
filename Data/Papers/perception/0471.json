In order to develop effective nutritional education and focused interventions, more of such information is thereby required to improve the nation\u2019s healthTo identify dietary patterns based on declared food consumption rates and subject responses on whether dieting, perception of body weight and diet and preparing meals are linked to such dietary patternsThe survey was conducted in 2016 on 344 consumers chosen for age (20-65 years) and their consent for study participation. Rates of eating the foods selected were measured using a 7-point scale. Cluster analysis was used to identify three dietary patterns of behaviour: \u2018potentially beneficial to health\u2019, \u2018potentially unfavourable for health; deficient\u2019 and \u2018potentially unfavourable for health; excessive\u2019. The analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 23.0There were significantly more subjects showing \u2018potentially beneficial for health\u2019 behaviour, normal body weight, those dieting (whether now or in the past) and those who evaluated their diet as being very good or good compared to other groups. They were also more involved in preparing their meals at home. Differences were found between the \u2018unfavourable for health\u2019 dietary patterns concerning subject\u2019s involvement in meal preparation. The dietary pattern for \u2018deficient\u2019 behaviour found lower rates of those preparing their meals at homeThe pattern of potentially beneficial dietary habits was linked to weight control through a slimming diet and greater involvement in the preparation of food for consumption. The results show the need to develop food choice skills rather than just transferring knowledge in the nutrition education process", "doi": null, "title": "Associations between adult perception of body weight, diet, preparing meals and dietary patterns", "journal": ["Roczniki Panstwowego Zakladu Higieny", "Rocz Panstw Zakl Hig"]}
