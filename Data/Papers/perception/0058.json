Studies using magnitude estimation rather than comparison show that number perception is compressed dramatically past about 20 units. Even estimates of 5-20 items are increasingly susceptible to effects of visual adaptation, suggesting a rather narrow range in which subitizing-like categorization processes blend into greater reliance on adaptable magnitude information.", "doi": "10.1017/S0140525X16002302", "title": "Multitudes are adaptable magnitudes in the estimation of number.", "journal": ["The Behavioral and brain sciences", "Behav Brain Sci"]}
