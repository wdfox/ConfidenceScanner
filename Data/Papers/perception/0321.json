We evaluated the following outcomes: physician professional satisfaction (range, 5-25, with higher values denoting higher satisfaction), autonomy (range, 4-16, with higher values denoting higher autonomy), perception of clinic workflow (range, 1 = calm, 5 = chaotic), and patient satisfaction (5-point Likert item, anchors: strongly agree, strongly disagree).Six physicians, including 3 rheumatologists and 3 endocrinologists, and 496 patients nested within their practices participated. The use of a medical scribe was not associated with physician professional satisfaction (18.17 [SD, 2.9] vs. 17.83 [SD, 1.94], not statistically significant), perception of clinic workflow (2.50 [SD, 0.84] vs. 3.17 [SD, 0.75], not statistically significant), or autonomy (8.67 [SD, 3.44] vs. 8.83 [SD, 3.06], not statistically significant). Physicians had an overall favorable view of the medical scribes program and perceived that documentation support provided by scribes was useful and easy to use and had a positive impact on their clinic workflow. Patient satisfaction was high during the intervention phase (99.4% strongly agree/agree) but not significantly different than in the control phase.Rheumatologists, endocrinologists, and their patients had consistently positive views regarding the use of a medical scribe without an observed negative effect on clinic workflow in outpatient clinics.", "doi": "10.1097/RHU.0000000000000620", "title": "Use of Scribes for Documentation Assistance in Rheumatology and Endocrinology Clinics: Impact on Clinic Workflow and Patient and Physician Satisfaction.", "journal": ["Journal of clinical rheumatology : practical reports on rheumatic & musculoskeletal diseases", "J Clin Rheumatol"]}
