We aimed to examine the effect of job insecurity on depression among automobile sales workers in South Korea.We analyzed data collected in 2007 and 2014 from a longitudinal cohort of 560 sales workers from an automobile company in South Korea. Change in job insecurity was classified into four groups: secure to secure; insecure to secure; secure to insecure; and insecure to insecure.After adjusting for potential confounders, workers in the insecure to insecure group had a significantly higher likelihood of depression in 2014 than workers in the secure to secure group (OR: 2.74; 95%CI: 1.41, 5.31).We found that chronic job insecurity may be a risk factor for developing depression among Korean automobile sales workers. This is the first longitudinal study examining the association between job insecurity and depression in South Korea.", "doi": "10.1002/ajim.22805", "title": "Job insecurity and depression among automobile sales workers: A longitudinal study in South Korea.", "journal": ["American journal of industrial medicine", "Am.
