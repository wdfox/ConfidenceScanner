Spanish-speaking Latino respondents (n\u2009=\u200947) had less accurate knowledge of laws permitting use of marijuana than English-speaking Latino respondents (n\u2009=\u2009154), while reporting greater agreement with negative health effects and higher perception of risk associated with marijuana use. The results suggest that efforts to communicate health and informational messaging to the public about legalized marijuana should consider linguistic variations when tailoring campaigns for Latino audiences.", "doi": "10.1080/15332640.2017.1404954", "title": "Legalized marijuana: Language-associated knowledge of laws and risk perceptions among Latinos.", "journal": ["Journal of ethnicity in substance abuse", "J Ethn Subst Abuse"]}
