Even more, during the last half of century there hasn't been much change in the perception of mentally ill persons as \"incurable and dangerous individuals incapable of living on their own\". The significance of mental illness stigma is determined by the size of its negative effect on mentally ill individuals, their family members, and the psychiatric service as well as on the society as a whole. In order to reduce the negative effects of stigma on the life of mentally ill individuals as well as to provide equal lifestyle in the community, at the beginning of the 1990s the World Health Organization recommended a global and decisive fight against the mental health stigma and discrimination. Since then three effective methods proliferated in fighting the mental illness stigma. These methods consist of combining education, contact with stigmatized group representatives and protest. To achieve better efficiency of anti-stigma program, the fight should be led by citizens of all age groups, especially younger people, the media, health care providers involved in treating the patients, but also the patients themselves as well as their family members.", "doi": null, "title": "Methods to Fight Mental Illness Stigma.", "journal": ["Psychiatria Danubina", "Psychiatr Danub"]}
