These differences in representational quality are thought to impose a burden on spoken language processing. The underlying mechanism to account for impoverished speech sound representations remains in debate. Previous findings that implicate sleep as important for building speech representations, combined with reports of atypical sleep in SLI, motivate the current investigation into a potential consolidation mechanism as a source of impoverished representations in SLI. In the current study, we trained individuals with SLI on a new (nonnative) set of speech sounds, and tracked their perceptual accuracy and neural responses to these sounds over two days. Adults with SLI achieved comparable performance to typical controls during training, however demonstrated a distinct lack of overnight gains on the next day. We propose that those with SLI may be impaired in the consolidation of acoustic-phonetic information.", "doi": "10.1016/j.neulet.2017.12.030", "title": "Adults with Specific Language Impairment fail to consolidate speech sounds during sleep.", "journal": ["Neuroscience letters", "Neurosci.
