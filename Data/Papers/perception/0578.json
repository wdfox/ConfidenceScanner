SD-OCT parameters included presence of subretinal fluid, epiretinal membrane, ellipsoid zone disruption (EZD), external limiting membrane disruption, central subfield thickness (CST), and choroidal thickness. Visual acuities (VAs) and duration of SiO instillation were recorded.Thirty eyes of 30 patients were included. Mean Snellen VA pre- and post-SOR was 20/762 and 20/206, respectively (P < .001). Eyes with EZD under SiO had significantly longer duration of SiO tamponade (P = .029) along with worse VA post-SOR (P = .002). EZD was noted in 20 eyes with SiO and only 10 eyes post-SOR. Of these 10 eyes with resolution of EZD post-SOR, mean VA was significantly better (Snellen equivalent 20/133) compared to eyes with persistent EZD (Snellen equivalent 20/513; P = .01). CST and choroidal thickness decreased post-SOR (P = .117, P = .07).Outer retinal abnormalities on SD-OCT in SiO-filled eyes may improve in some patients following SOR. Some changes may be related to duration of SiO tamponade. EZD in SiO-filled eyes may portend a worse clinical outcome post-SOR despite surgical success.
