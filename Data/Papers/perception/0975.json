On one hand, disruption of blood barrier and homeostasis of the body are the main targets of vascular irregularity. Inflammation and immune disorders including autoimmunity are considered as a consequence of the abnormal vascular regulation processes. On the other hand, decreased thirst feeling typical for FS-affected individuals may lead to extensive body dehydration resulting in dry eye appearance and breast cancer (BC) risk, amongst others. To this end, recent research demonstrated FS as linked to BC development and progression into the metastatic disease. On the other side, Sj\u00f6gren syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disease characterised by a progressive sicca syndrome associated with the dry eye symptoms, specific immunologic complex and/or significant infiltrate at minor salivary gland biopsy. SS is relatively frequent, with a clinical diagnosis predominantly amongst women. Its physiopathology is a complex battery of both environmental and genetic factors. If left untreated, SS may be associated with and/or resulted in severe arthritis and the development of B cell lymphoma. In this mini-review, we summarise the facts and hypotheses connecting FS and SS symptoms together and mechanisms potentially overlapping in both syndromes. Unraveling the common denominators between these two syndromes not only providing more evidence for interaction between altered sense regulation, vascular dysregulation, immune system dysfunction but also focusing on the individual outcomes in terms of severity grade and potential complications exploring novel diagnostic, prognostic and treatment modalities.
