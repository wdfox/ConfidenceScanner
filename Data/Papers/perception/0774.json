With proper training, student pharmacists can play an important role in counseling patients on the importance of HIV testing and providing instruction on in-home testing. The objective of the study was to assess student pharmacists' knowledge, attitudes and beliefs of HIV and the use of an in-home, over-the-counter HIV testing device.A cross-sectional electronic survey was conducted among an estimated sample of 2077 students from six regional schools of pharmacy. The questionnaire consisted of 40 closed-ended, fixed-choice items delivered using school/organizational listservs. Surveys were e-mailed during March and April 2016 with a reminder e-mail sent two weeks later. Key outcomes included real and perceived knowledge, attitudes and beliefs of HIV in general and of the OraQuick\u00ae In-Home HIV test.A total of 387 student pharmacists participated (response rate of 18.6%). Respondents expressed positive perception of knowledge regarding HIV in general (67.6% highly agree/agree to five-item scale) but considerably lower attitude/beliefs for the in-home HIV test (16.7% highly agree/agree overall to five-item scale). Perceptions of general HIV knowledge were higher for students in later professional years (p < 0.001), post-completion of infectious disease curriculum with inclusion of the in-home HIV test (p < 0.001), and if the respondent had personally received an HIV test (p < 0.01).Opportunities exist to improve knowledge of HIV and the use of the OraQuick\u00ae In-Home HIV test among student pharmacists.", "doi": "10.1016/j.cptl.2017.07.013", "title": "Knowledge, attitudes and beliefs regarding human immunodeficiency virus and in-home testing among a regional sample of student pharmacists.", "journal": ["Currents in pharmacy teaching & learning", "Curr Pharm Teach Learn"]}
