These volatile phenols formed from free hydroxycinnamic acids and their ethyl esters by Dekkera/Brettanomyces yeasts, can contaminate wines. Their formation can cause serious negative economic impact to the wine industry worldwide as consumers tend to reject these wines. For these reasons various preventive and remedial treatments have been studied. This review summarises the wine microbial volatile phenols formation, preventive measures during winemaking and remedial treatments in finished wines along with their advantages and limitations for dealing with this sensory defect and impact on wine quality. Also it is important to control the levels of volatile phenols in wines using fast and convenient analytical methods namely with a detection limit below their olfactory perception threshold. The analytical methods available for quality control and performance characteristics as well their advantages and disadvantages when dealing with a complex matrix like wine are discussed in detail.", "doi": "10.1080/10408398.2017.1408563", "title": "4-Ethylphenol, 4-ethylguaiacol and 4-ethylcatechol in red wines: Microbial formation, prevention, remediation and overview of analytical approaches.", "journal": ["Critical reviews in food science and nutrition", "Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr"]}
