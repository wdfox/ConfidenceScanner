However, little research has examined this issue in the context of developmental science, especially during joint sessions where parents engage in a task in front of their 7-8-year-old children. In this study, 22 Canadian and 20 Japanese child-parent dyads participated in an emotion judgment task, and were asked to judge a central figure's emotion and explain their reasoning. The results indicated that while early elementary school children did not show culturally dominant reasoning styles, parents displayed culturally dominant modes of attention, serving as models for their children.", "doi": "10.1007/s40167-017-0052-0", "title": "Culture and emotion perception: comparing Canadian and Japanese children's and parents' context sensitivity.", "journal": ["Culture and brain", "Cult Brain"]}
