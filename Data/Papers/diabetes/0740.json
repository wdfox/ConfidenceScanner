Electronic address: robertty@mail.nih.gov."]], "text": "We demonstrate the feasibility of high-resolution 1H magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at low temperatures by obtaining an MRI image of 20\u202f\u03bcm diameter glass beads in glycerol/water at 28\u202fK with 2.8\u202f\u03bcm isotropic resolution. The experiments use a recently-described MRI apparatus (Moore and Tycko, 2015) with minor modifications. The sample is contained within a radio-frequency microcoil with 150\u202f\u03bcm inner diameter. Sensitivity is additionally enhanced by paramagnetic doping, optimization of the sample temperature, three-dimensional phase-encoding of k-space data, pulsed spin-lock detection of 1H nuclear magnetic resonance signals, and spherical sampling of k-space. We verify that the actual image resolution is 2.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.3\u202f\u03bcm by quantitative comparisons of experimental and calculated images. Our imaging approach is compatible with dynamic nuclear polarization, providing a path to significantly higher resolution in future experiments.", "id": "29288890", "date": "2017-12-20", "title": "Low-temperature magnetic resonance imaging with 2.8\u202f\u03bcm isotropic resolution.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jmr.2017.12.016", "journal": ["Journal of magnetic resonance (San Diego, Calif. : 1997)", "J.
