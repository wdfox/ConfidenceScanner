System accuracy of this improved system was evaluated based on ISO 15197:2013, clause 6.3, for three reagent system lots. According to this standard, at least 95% of the system's measurement results shall be within \u00b115 mg/dL and \u00b115% of the results of the comparison method at glucose concentrations <100 mg/dL and \u2265100 mg/dL (accuracy criterion A), respectively, and at least 99% of results shall be within consensus error grid zones A and B (accuracy criterion B). In addition, accuracy was evaluated in the hands of users based on ISO 15197:2013, clause 8, with one reagent system lot.", "id": "29291625", "date": "2017-12-01", "title": "System Accuracy and User Performance Evaluation of an Improved System for Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose.", "doi": "10.1177/1932296817752958", "journal": ["Journal of diabetes science and technology", "J Diabetes Sci Technol"]}
