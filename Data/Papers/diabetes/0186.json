The trajectory of complications in patients diagnosed at a younger or older age is not well understood. We examine the associations between age, age at diagnosis and diabetes duration and vascular complications in patients with T2DM.A cross-sectional study of pre-specified demographic and clinical data, from 3419 adults with T2DM participating in the Australian National Diabetes Audit (2015). Factors associated with diabetes complications were analysed using logistic regression.Mean (\u00b1SD) current age was 62.9\u00b112.5years, age at diagnosis was 49.4\u00b112.3years and mean diabetes duration was 13.5\u00b19.4years. Macrovascular complications were more prevalent in patients who were older at diabetes diagnosis whereas microvascular complications were more prevalent in patients who were younger at diabetes diagnosis. Age, age at diagnosis and diabetes duration were all independently associated with increased risk of macrovascular complications after adjustment for sex, smoking, BMI and microvascular complications (all p<0.001). In contrast, only diabetes duration was independently associated with microvascular complications after adjustment for sex, smoking, BMI and macrovascular complications (p<0.001).Age, age at diagnosis, and diabetes duration were all independently associated with macrovascular complications whereas only diabetes duration was independently associated with microvascular complications.", "id": "29352694", "date": "2017-12-07", "title": "Age, age at diagnosis and diabetes duration are all associated with vascular complications in type 2 diabetes.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jdiacomp.2017.11.009", "journal": ["Journal of diabetes and its complications", "J.
