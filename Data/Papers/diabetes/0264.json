When patients were substratified by preoperative pharmacologic therapy, IDD and NIDD patients had different remission rates within the same A1C level. At 6-months follow-up within A1C \u22656.5 to<8 (IDD versus NIDD), the remission rate was 23.5% versus 64.1% (odds ratio [OR]: .173, confidence interval [CI]: .0471, .6308, P = .0079), and within A1C \u22658 the remission was 24.0% versus 37.5% (OR: .5263, CI: .2115, 1.3096, P = .1676), respectively. At 1-year follow-up within A1C \u22656.5 to<8, the remission rate was 30.0% versus 62.9% (OR: .2521, CI: .0529, 1.2019, P = .0838), and within A1C \u22658 the remission was 31.4% versus 61.9% (OR: .2821, CI: .0908, .8762, P = .0286), respectively. Furthermore, when IDD patients were compared between A1C \u22656.5 to<8 and A1C \u22658 the remission rates were nearly identical, and for NIDD patients A1C was not significantly associated with remission regardless of the level, except at 6 months.While a difference was observed between overall A1C levels-the lower the A1C level, the higher the remission rate-IDD patients had lower remission rates than NIDD patients irrespective of A1C levels; further, IDD patients performed similarly across A1C levels.", "id": "29339030", "date": "2017-11-22", "title": "Preoperative insulin therapy as a marker for type 2 diabetes remission in obese patients after bariatric surgery.", "doi": "10.1016/j.soard.2017.11.016", "journal": ["Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery", "Surg Obes Relat Dis"]}
