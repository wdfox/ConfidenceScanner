Various studies have demonstrated that environmental variables influence food intake behaviour. In the present study we examined the effect of a portion design plate with food group portion guidelines demarcated by coloured lines (ETE Plate\u2122). A two-group quasi-experimental design was used to measure proportions of carbohydrate, vegetable and protein portions and user experience in a hospital staff lounge setting in Singapore. Lunch was served on the portion design plate before 12.15 hours. For comparison, a normal plate (without markings) was used after 12.15 hours. Changes in proportions of food groups from 2 months before the introduction of the design plate were analysed in a stratified sample at baseline (859 subjects, all on normal plates) to 1, 3 and 6 months after (in all 1016 subjects on the design plate, 968 subjects on the control plate). A total of 151 participants were asked about their experiences and opinions. Between-group comparisons were performed using t tests. Among those served on the portion design plate at 6 months after its introduction, the proportion of vegetables was 4\u00b771\u00a0% (P\u00a0<\u00a00\u00b7001) higher and that of carbohydrates 2\u00b783\u00a0% (P\u00a0<\u00a00\u00b7001) lower relative to the baseline. No significant change was found for proteins (-1\u00b785\u00a0%). Over 6 months, we observed different change patterns between the different food group proportions. While participants were positive about the portion design plate, they did not think it would influence their personal behaviour. A portion design plate might stimulate food group guideline adherence among hospital staff and beyond.", "id": "29299308", "date": "2017-12-13", "title": "Effects of a portion design plate on food group guideline adherence among hospital staff.", "doi": "10.1017/jns.2017.60", "journal": ["Journal of nutritional science", "J Nutr Sci"]}
