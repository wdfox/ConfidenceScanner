These are a relatively new addition to the armamentaria of diabetes management. Postmarketing surveillance is a witness to several side effects, a morbid one being ketoacidosis. Herein is discussed a scenario of a Type II diabetic who presented with substantial ketoacidosis without significant hyperglycemia. The absence of the customary precipitating factors and the presence of a recent introduction of canagliflozin, a SGLT-2 inhibitor to the diabetes prescription, hinted at the causal relationship. Of note, she had never experienced diabetic ketoacidosis in the past prior to commencement of SGLT-2 inhibitor therapy. As clinicians, we need to be aware of the treatment-emergent adverse effect of this relatively new class of diabetic treatment.", "id": "29279644", "date": null, "title": "Canagliflozin-associated Diabetic Ketoacidosis with Lower-than-anticipated Glucose Levels.", "doi": "10.4103/ijccm.IJCCM_328_17", "journal": ["Indian journal of critical care medicine : peer-reviewed, official publication of Indian Society of Critical Care Medicine", "Indian J Crit Care Med"]}
