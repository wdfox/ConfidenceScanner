However, its association with the prognosis and development of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) has not yet been determined. Therefore, the present study aimed to examine the expression and function of RAR\u03b1 in patients with LSCC. The expression of RAR\u03b1 in LSCC tissues was investigated using immunostaining. An MTT assay and flow cytometry analysis were also performed to investigate the function of RAR\u03b1 in the proliferation and cell cycle of LSCC cells. The expression of RAR\u03b1 was significantly elevated in LSCC tissues compared with adjacent noncancerous tissues (78.1 vs. 6.3%, P<0.05). The overexpression of RAR\u03b1 was associated with poorly differentiated features of LSCC (P<0.05). Furthermore, the downregulation of RAR\u03b1 inhibited the proliferation of LSCC cells, and arrested the cell cycle at the G1 phase via upregulation of cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1A, which may be associated with inhibition of the protein kinase B signaling pathway. Therefore, the overexpression of RAR\u03b1 may contribute to the development of LSCC through the regulation of the cell cycle. The results of the present study provide evidence that RAR\u03b1 serves an important function in LSCC development and may be a potential therapeutic target or prognostic predictor for LSCC.", "id": "29344234", "date": "2017-10-16", "title": "An oncogenic function of retinoic acid receptor-\u03b1 in the development of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma.", "doi": "10.3892/ol.2017.7194", "journal": ["Oncology letters", "Oncol Lett"]}
