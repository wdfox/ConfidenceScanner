Due to their ability to interact with carbohydrates, they can be regarded as synthetic mimics of lectins, termed 'borono-lectins'. The borono-lectins can be tailored to elicit a broad profile of binding strength and specificity. This special property has been translated into many creative biomedical applications in a way interactive with biology. This review provides a brief overview of recent efforts of polymeric materials-based engineering taking advantage of such virtue of 'borono-lectins' chemistry, related to the field of biomaterials and drug delivery applications.", "id": "29296128", "date": "2017-12-19", "title": "'Borono-lectin' based engineering as a versatile platform for biomedical applications.", "doi": "10.1080/14686996.2017.1411143", "journal": ["Science and technology of advanced materials", "Sci Technol Adv Mater"]}
