This sequential nature of EHR data make them wellmatched for the power of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). In this poster, we propose \"Deep Diabetologist\" - using RNNs for EHR sequential data modeling to provide personalized hypoglycemic medication prediction for diabetic patients. Our results demonstrate improved performance compared with a baseline classifier using logistic regression.", "id": "29295362", "date": null, "title": "Deep Diabetologist: Learning to Prescribe Hypoglycemic Medications with Recurrent Neural Networks.", "doi": null, "journal": ["Studies in health technology and informatics", "Stud Health Technol Inform"]}
