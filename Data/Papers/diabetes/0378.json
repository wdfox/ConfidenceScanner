Anthropometric measurements were linked to global noise annoyance (GNA) based on different residential noise annoyances, day-evening-night (Lden), and nighttime (Lnight) road traffic noise exposure. Noise map Lden and Lnight were determined at the living room and bedroom fa\u00e7ades, respectively, and further corrected to indoor exposure based on the window-opening frequency and soundproofing insulation.Results showed that BMI and WC increased (non-significantly) per 5\u2009dB. The effect of indoor noise was stronger in comparison with that of outdoor noise. For indoor Lden, the effect was more pronounced in men, those with diabetes, family history of diabetes, high noise sensitivity, using solid fuel/gas for domestic heating/cooking, and living on the first floor. As regards indoor Lnight, its effect was more pronounced in those with low socioeconomic status, hearing loss, and using solid fuel/gas for domestic heating/cooking. GNA was associated with lower BMI and WC.Road traffic noise was associated with an increase in adiposity in some potentially vulnerable patients with CVD.", "id": "29319011", "date": null, "title": "Association between community noise and adiposity in patients with cardiovascular disease.", "doi": "10.4103/nah.NAH_78_16", "journal": ["Noise & health", "Noise Health"]}
