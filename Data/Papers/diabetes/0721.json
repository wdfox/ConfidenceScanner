In this study, we investigated the role of Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor (PPAR)\u03b2/\u03b4 and fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) in hepatic VLDLR regulation.Studies were conducted in wild-type and Ppar\u03b2/\u03b4-null mice, primary mouse hepatocytes, human Huh-7 hepatocytes, and liver biopsies from control subjects and patients with moderate and severe hepatic steatosis.Increased VLDLR levels were observed in liver of Ppar\u03b2/\u03b4-null mice and in Ppar\u03b2/\u03b4-knocked down mouse primary hepatocytes through mechanisms involving the heme-regulated eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2\u03b1 (eIF2\u03b1) kinase (HRI), activating transcription factor (ATF) 4 and the oxidative stress-induced nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) pathways. Moreover, by using a neutralizing antibody against FGF21, Fgf21-null mice and by treating mice with recombinant FGF21, we show that FGF21 may protect against hepatic steatosis by attenuating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced VLDLR upregulation. Finally, in liver biopsies from patients with moderate and severe hepatic steatosis, we observed an increase in VLDLR levels that was accompanied by a reduction in PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 mRNA abundance and DNA-binding activity compared with control subjects.Overall, these findings provide new mechanisms by which PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 and FGF21 regulate VLDLR levels and influence hepatic steatosis development.", "id": "29289645", "date": "2017-12-19", "title": "Hepatic regulation of VLDL receptor by PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 and FGF21 modulates non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.", "doi": "10.1016/j.molmet.2017.12.008", "journal": ["Molecular metabolism", "Mol Metab"]}
