One hundred and six patients were below 40 years, 138 patients between 41 and 50 years, 97 in 51-60 years, and 99 above 60 years of age. Data were statistically analyzed by Student's t-test.Nearly 57% of the patients showed a Russell's Periodontal Index score of 2-4.9, which suggested an established periodontal disease. Risk factors for the people above the age of 40 years to develop diabetes were 76%.The frequency of oral manifestations in diabetic patients was significantly high, hence showing a relationship of gingival and periodontal diseases with diabetes mellitus.", "id": "29284966", "date": null, "title": "A Study of Diabetes Associated Oral Manifestations.", "doi": "10.4103/jpbs.JPBS_157_17", "journal": ["Journal of pharmacy & bioallied sciences", "J Pharm Bioallied Sci"]}
