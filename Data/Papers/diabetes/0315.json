Major adverse events (MAE), defined as amputation, death, target lesion/vessel revascularization (TLR/TVR), myocardial infarction, or angiographic distal embolization that required a separate intervention; and binary restenosis were assessed at 30days and 12months.The mean (\u00b1SD) lesion length was 16.4\u00b113.6cm; 35% of patients received adjunctive stents. Procedural success was achieved for 98.3% of lesions. The 30-day MAE rate was 2% (5/219; 2 TLR/TVR and 3 distal embolization); there were no deaths, index limb amputations, or myocardial infarctions. At 12months, the overall estimated freedom from TLR/TVR was 81.7% and 77.2% (44/57) of patients were free from duplex ultrasound-assessed restenosis. Efficacy and patency in a diabetic subset were similar to those of the overall cohort, while maintaining a similar safety profile.In a cohort reflecting real-world practice, the Jetstream Atherectomy System demonstrated a high procedural success rate with a low rate of complications and reinterventions, especially given the relatively long lesions studied.", "id": "29331436", "date": "2017-12-27", "title": "Jetstream Atherectomy System treatment of femoropopliteal arteries: Results of the post-market JET Registry.", "doi": "10.1016/j.carrev.2017.12.015", "journal": ["Cardiovascular revascularization medicine : including molecular interventions", "Cardiovasc Revasc Med"]}
