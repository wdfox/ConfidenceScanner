Although in vitro studies are an instrumental tool, in vivo studies allow observation of the overall effect on a living organism. The aim of this research was to assess how in vivo starch digestibility can be reduced when frying under vacuum (9.9\u202fkPa), after feeding Sprague-Dawley rats, while also understanding its relationship to in vitro starch digestibility. Results showed that vacuum-fried dough has a lower degree of gelatinization (\u223c53.8%) and a maximal blood glucose level at 60\u202fmin (slower glycemic response) than atmospheric counterparts (\u223c98.3% degree of gelatinization and maximal blood glucose level at 30\u202fmin). Similarly, in vitro procedures exhibited less rapidly available glucose and higher unavailable glucose fractions in vacuum-fried dough.", "id": "29287392", "date": "2017-11-05", "title": "In vivo study on the slow release of glucose in vacuum fried matrices.", "doi": "10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.10.118", "journal": ["Food chemistry", "Food Chem"]}
