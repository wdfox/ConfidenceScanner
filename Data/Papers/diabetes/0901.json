Miscarried helping has not, however, been measured in adults with diabetes, which was the purpose of our study.Data from a randomized clinical trial (n = 268) were analyzed to establish the psychometric properties and correlates of an adaptation of a measure of miscarried helping developed in pediatric populations, for use with adults with T2D.The Helping for Health Inventory-Couples Version (HHI-C) was found to have three underlying factors and demonstrated adequate internal consistency across time (\u03b1 at baseline = .86, 4 months = .87, 8 months = .86, and 12 months = .83) and showed high test-retest reliability (p < .01) over a 12-month period. Convergent validity was partially supported, because baseline HHI-C was positively associated with maladaptive conflict resolution strategies (p = .03) and negatively associated with adaptive conflict resolution strategies (p = .04) and diabetes knowledge (p < .01). The HHI-C did not correlate with body mass index or hemoglobin A1c, a measure of glycemic control. The HHI-C was positively associated with diabetes distress (p < .01) and depressive symptoms (p = .01).This study is the 1st known reporting of the psychometric properties of a measure of miscarried helping for adults with T2D. This valid measure of miscarried helping could be useful in future studies evaluating novel, relationship-based approaches to assist adults with T2D in disease management.
