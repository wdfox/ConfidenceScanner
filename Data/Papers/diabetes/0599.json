In this context, Brassicaceae are considered important vegetables due to several evidences of their health promoting effects that are associated to bioactive compounds present in the edible parts of the plants. In this review, the mechanisms of action and the factors regulating the levels of the bioactive compounds in Brassicaceae have been discussed. In addition, the impact of industrial and domestic processing on the amount of these compounds have been considered, in order to identify the best conditions that are able to preserve the functional properties of the Brassicaceae products before consumption. Finally, the main strategies used to increase the content of health-promoting metabolites in Brassica plants through biofortification have been analyzed.", "id": "29295478", "date": "2017-12-23", "title": "Bioactive Compounds in Brassicaceae Vegetables with a Role in the Prevention of Chronic Diseases.", "doi": "10.3390/molecules23010015", "journal": ["Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)", "Molecules"]}
