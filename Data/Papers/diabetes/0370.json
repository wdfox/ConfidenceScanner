Methods: A total of 9 cases of PC with coexisting lung cancer, admitted to Fuzhou Pulmonary Hospital of Fujian from 1st January 2009 to 31th December 2016, and confirmed by pathological examinations, were studied and the related literature were reviewed. Results: The patients consisted of 1 male and 8 females, with a mean age of (53\u00b110) years (range, 38 to 68 years). Four patients (44.4%) had underlying diseases, 3 with diabetes mellitus and 1 with gastric cancer surgery. The main clinical manifestations of most cases were cough and phlegm. The lesions of PC on chest CT were mostly solitary or multiple nodules with a diameter < 1 cm, and the lesions of carcinoma were shown as solitary nodules with a variety of signs suggestive of malignancy. All the patients were confirmed to have concomitant PC and lung adenocarcinoma by pathological examinations. Lung cancer stage was early (Tis and \u2160-\u2161) in 88.9 % (8 cases) of the cases. All the patients received surgery and postoperative medical therapy. The prognosis was relatively good in most of them except 1 case with death due to lung cancer metastasis and 1 case with lung cancer recurrence. Conclusions: Coexistence of PC and lung cancer is rare and the clinical symptoms are not specific. When PC coexists with carcinoma and manifests as pulmonary nodule, it mimics malignant lesions and is extremely easy to be misdiagnosed. Therefore PC must be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary nodules.\u76ee\u7684\uff1a \u63a2\u8ba8\u7ed3\u8282\u578b\u80ba\u9690\u7403\u83cc\u75c5\u5408\u5e76\u80ba\u764c\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u7279\u5f81\u3002 \u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a \u56de\u987e\u5206\u6790\u798f\u5efa\u7701\u798f\u5dde\u80ba\u79d1\u533b\u96622009\u5e741\u6708\u81f32016\u5e7412\u6708\u7ecf\u75c5\u7406\u786e\u8bca\u76849\u4f8b\u80ba\u9690\u7403\u83cc\u75c5\u5408\u5e76\u80ba\u764c\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u8d44\u6599\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u76f8\u5173\u6587\u732e\u590d\u4e60\u3002 \u7ed3\u679c\uff1a 9\u4f8b\u4e2d\uff0c\u75371\u4f8b\uff0c\u59738\u4f8b\uff0c\u5e74\u9f8438\uff5e68\u5c81\uff0c\u5e73\u5747(53\u00b110)\u5c81\u30024\u4f8b\u6709\u57fa\u7840\u75be\u75c5\uff0c3\u4f8b\u4e3a\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\uff0c1\u4f8b\u4e3a\u80c3\u764c\u672f\u540e\u3002\u4e34\u5e8a\u75c7\u72b6\u4e3b\u8981\u4e3a\u54b3\u55fd\u548c\u54b3\u75f0\u30029\u4f8b\u80ba\u9690\u7403\u83cc\u75c5\u7684\u5f71\u50cf\u5b66\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u5355\u53d1\u6216\u591a\u53d1\u7ed3\u8282\u5f71\uff0c\u4ee5\u76f4\u5f84<1 cm\u7684\u5c0f\u7ed3\u8282\u4e3a\u4e3b(\u5747\u7ecf\u75c5\u7406\u8bc1\u5b9e)\uff1b\u80ba\u764c\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u5355\u53d1\u7ed3\u8282\u5f71\uff0c\u4f34\u6709\u591a\u79cd\u80bf\u7624\u5f81\u8c61\uff0c8\u4f8b\u4e3a\u65e9\u671f\u80ba\u764c(\u539f\u4f4d\u764c\u548c\u2160\uff5e\u2161\u671f)\u30029\u4f8b\u5747\u63a5\u53d7\u5916\u79d1\u624b\u672f\u8054\u5408\u672f\u540e\u836f\u7269\u6cbb\u7597\uff0c\u672f\u540e1\u4f8b\u56e0\u80ba\u764c\u8f6c\u79fb\u6b7b\u4ea1\uff0c1\u4f8b\u80ba\u764c\u590d\u53d1\u3002 \u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a \u80ba\u9690\u7403\u83cc\u75c5\u5408\u5e76\u80ba\u764c\u4e34\u5e8a\u5c11\u89c1\uff0c\u4e34\u5e8a\u8868\u73b0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7279\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u5f53\u80ba\u9690\u7403\u83cc\u75c5\u4e0e\u80ba\u764c\u5e76\u5b58\u5e76\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u80ba\u7ed3\u8282\u65f6\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u8bef\u8bca\u3002\u5728\u80ba\u5185\u7ed3\u8282\u75c5\u53d8\u7684\u9274\u522b\u8bca\u65ad\u65f6\u5e94\u8003\u8651\u9690\u7403\u83cc\u611f\u67d3\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u3002.", "id": "29320833", "date": null, "title": "[Analysis of 9 cases of nodular type of pulmonary cryptococcosis with coexisting lung cancer confirmed by pathological examinations].", "doi": null, "journal": ["Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases", "Zhonghua Jie He He Hu Xi Za Zhi"]}
