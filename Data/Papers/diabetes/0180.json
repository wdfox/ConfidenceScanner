In most cases, they are not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Regulatory boards in Latin American countries do not allow the medical use of STF injections; however, these injections are still widely used. A case of calcitriol-mediated hypercalcemia with ectopic calcifications, chronic kidney disease, nephrolithiasis and calcinosis is presented. The reported case highlights the consequences of STF use, including calcitriol-mediated hypercalcemia secondary to granulomatous reactions years after an esthetic procedure.", "id": "29354165", "date": "2017-12-27", "title": "Calcitriol-mediated hypercalcemia secondary to granulomatous disease caused by soft-tissue filler injection: a case report.", "doi": "10.11138/ccmbm/2017.14.3.340", "journal": ["Clinical cases in mineral and bone metabolism : the official journal of the Italian Society of Osteoporosis, Mineral Metabolism, and Skeletal Diseases", "Clin Cases Miner Bone Metab"]}
