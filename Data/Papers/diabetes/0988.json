This study aimed to reveal the relationship between high-normal albuminuria and incident chronic kidney disease in a Japanese nondiabetic population.A 10-year follow-up retrospective cohort study was performed involving 1378 Japanese men (mean age 44\u2009\u00b1\u20095.3\u00a0years) without chronic kidney disease and diabetes mellitus. Chronic kidney disease was diagnosed as either estimated glomerular filtration rate <\u200960\u00a0mL/min/1.73\u00a0m2 or a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio \u2265\u200930\u00a0mg/g.At baseline, age, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and the presence of hematuria, hypertension, and dyslipidemia were independently associated with the albumin-to-creatinine ratio. Among the 1378 participants, 185 (13.4%) fulfilled diagnostic criteria for chronic kidney disease over the 10-year follow-up period. Median annual estimated glomerular filtration rate decline showed a deterioration with increasing quartiles of baseline albumin-to-creatinine ratio (P\u2009=\u20090.004). Participants who had a baseline albumin-to-creatinine ratio in the highest quartile (5.9-28.9\u00a0mg/g) were more likely to develop micro- or macroalbuminuria (odds ratio: 16.23, 95% confidence interval 6.56-54.03), chronic kidney disease (odds ratio: 2.48, 95% confidence interval 1.64-3.82), and hypertension (odds ratio 2.06, 95% confidence interval 1.30-3.31), but not diabetes mellitus compared with those who had an albumin-to-creatinine ratio in the lowest quartile (1.3-3.6\u00a0mg/g) after adjustment for potential confounders.High-normal albuminuria was associated with incident chronic kidney disease in this Japanese nondiabetic male population.", "id": "29280046", "date": "2017-12-26", "title": "High-normal albuminuria and incident chronic kidney disease in a male nondiabetic population.", "doi": "10.1007/s10157-017-1522-6", "journal": ["Clinical and experimental nephrology", "Clin.
