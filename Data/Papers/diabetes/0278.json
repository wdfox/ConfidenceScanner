FG, 2HG, HbA1c, fasting insulin, HOMA-IR and glucose tolerance categories were analyzed for association with ACR and eGFR in multivariable adjusted linear and median regression models, and with isolated microalbuminuria (i-MA), isolated reduced kidney function (i-RKF) and chronic kidney disease (CKD, defined as MA and/or RKF) in multivariable adjusted logistic regression models. Among the 2713 study participants, 28% revealed prediabetes (isolated impaired fasting glucose [i-IFG], isolated glucose tolerance [i-IGT] or both by American Diabetes Association definition), 4.2% had unknown type 2 diabetes, 6.5% had i-MA, 3.1% i-RKF and 10.9% CKD. In multivariable adjusted analysis, all continuous variables (FG, 2HG, HbA1c, fasting insulin and HOMA-IR) were associated with i-MA, i-RKF and CKD. The odds ratios (ORs) for i-MA and CKD were 1.54 (95% confidence interval: 1.02-2.33) and 1.58 (1.10-2.25) for individuals with i-IFG. Moreover, the OR for i-RKF was 2.57 (1.31-5.06) for individuals with IFG\u00a0+\u00a0IGT.Our findings suggest that prediabetes might have harmful effects on the kidney.", "id": "29337019", "date": "2017-12-22", "title": "Prediabetes is associated with microalbuminuria, reduced kidney function and chronic kidney disease in the general population: The KORA (Cooperative Health Research in the Augsburg Region) F4-Study.", "doi": "10.1016/j.numecd.2017.12.005", "journal": ["Nutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases : NMCD", "Nutr Metab Cardiovasc Dis"]}
