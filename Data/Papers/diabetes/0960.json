In this study, we assessed the effects of hyperglycemia on bone tissue compositional properties, enzymatic collagen crosslinks, and advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) in the KK-Ay murine model of T2DM using Fourier transform infrared imaging and high-performance liquid chromatography. Compared to KK-aa littermate controls (n\u2009=\u20098), proximal femoral bone tissue of KK-Ay mice (n\u2009=\u200914) exhibited increased collagen maturity, increased mineral content, and less heterogeneous mineral properties. AGE accumulation assessed by the concentration of pentosidine, as well as the concentrations of the non-enzymatic crosslinks hydroxylysyl pyridinoline and lysyl pyridinoline, did not differ in the proximal femora of KK-Ay mice compared to controls. The observed differences in tissue-level compositional properties in the KK-Ay mice are consistent with bone that is older and echo observations of reduced remodeling in T2DM.
