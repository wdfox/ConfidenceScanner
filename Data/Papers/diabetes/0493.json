The mechanisms remain unknown but reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been implicated in this condition. In this study, we assessed the role of ROS and a candidate downstream target, MMP-13 in glucose-induced sensory axon degeneration in zebrafish and mice.The effects of glucose on metabolism and sensory axon degeneration were assessed using qPCR and live imaging. ROS were analyzed using pentafluorobenzene-sulfonyl fluorescein and activation of the NF-\u03baB stress response was determined using Tg(NF-\u03baB:GFP) zebrafish. The role of MMP-13 and ROS in glucose-dependent axon degeneration was determined in zebrafish following treatment with the antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine and the MMP-13 inhibitor, DB04760. Neuropathic mice fed on a high-fat/high-sugar diet were treated with the MMP-13 inhibitor, CL-82198 to assess sensory recovery.Glucose treatment of zebrafish induced metabolic changes that resemble diabetes. Sensory axon degeneration was mediated by ROS-induced MMP-13 and prevented upon antioxidant treatment or MMP-13 inhibition. MMP-13 inhibition also reversed neuropathy in diabetic mice.We demonstrate that zebrafish are suitable to study glucose-induced neurotoxicity. Given the effects in zebrafish and mice, MMP-13 inhibition may be beneficial in the treatment of human diabetic neuropathy.", "id": "29306589", "date": "2017-12-06", "title": "Oxidative stress-dependent MMP-13 activity underlies glucose neurotoxicity.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jdiacomp.2017.11.012", "journal": ["Journal of diabetes and its complications", "J.
