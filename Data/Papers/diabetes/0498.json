Materials and methods: A case-control study was carried out between 2006 and 2007 for black Central African participants managed for HOMA.Results: In total, 219 patients and 110 healthy controls were matched for sex and age. The hyperbolic product for 85 infected patients occupied an intermediate position between the hyperbolic product for 110 controls and that of 134 type 2 diabetics. Inflammation/oxidative stress was present in all infected patients, as well as in the type 2 diabetics. Of the patients, 39.3% and 49.8% had insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome, respectively. Insulin resistance was more prevalent in nondiabetics with inflammation/oxidative stress (47.1%; P = 0.041) than in type 2 diabetics (34.3%). Type 2 diabetics had higher insulin sensitivity and lower beta-cell function but a similar HOMA-IR score. Conclusion: We recommend the assessment of insulin resistance in Central African patients with severe infections and type 2 diabetes.", "id": "29306246", "date": "2017-12-19", "title": "Hyperbolic relation between beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity for type 2 diabetes mellitus, malaria, influenza, Helicobacter pylori, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and hepatitis C virus infection-induced inflammation/oxidative stress and temporary insulin resistance in Central Africans", "doi": "10.3906/sag-1608-48", "journal": ["Turkish journal of medical sciences", "Turk J Med Sci"]}
