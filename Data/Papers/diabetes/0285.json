Traditional fasting lipid profiles, ApoB and ApoA-I levels were examined. CIMT was measured at three points on the far wall of 1 cm long section of the common carotid artery in the proximity of the carotid bulb. The mean value of six measurements from right and left carotid arteries were used as the mean CIMT. In this study, carotid atherosclerosis was defined as having a focal plaque or diffuse thickening of the carotid wall (mean CIMT \u2265 1.0 mm).The prevalence of carotid atherosclerosis increased with ApoB/ApoA-I ratio. The ApoB/ApoA-I ratio, expressed as both quartiles (odds ratio [OR], 2.14; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.21 to 3.79; p for trend = 0.014) and continuous values (OR, 10.05; 95% CI, 3.26 to 30.97; p < 0.001), was significantly associated with a higher risk for carotid atherosclerosis, regardless of conventional cardiovascular disease risk factors. The optimal ApoB/ApoA-I ratio cutoff value for detecting carotid atherosclerosis was 0.57, based on receiver operating characteristic curve analysis with a sensitivity of 58.0% and a specificity of 55.1%.A high ApoB/ApoA-I ratio was significantly associated with carotid atherosclerosis in T2DM patients with LDL-C levels less than 100 mg/dL.", "id": "29334727", "date": "2017-12-28", "title": "ApoB/ApoA-I ratio is independently associated with carotid atherosclerosis in type 2 diabetes mellitus with well-controlled LDL cholesterol levels.", "doi": "10.3904/kjim.2017.396", "journal": ["The Korean journal of internal medicine", "Korean J.
