This carries a significant morbidity and mortality particularly if left untreated or if the diagnosis is delayed. We present a case of euglycaemic DKA in a 48 year old female with non-insulin treated T2DM who had good glycaemic control. Initial investigations revealed moderate metabolic acidosis, persistent ketonuria and blood glucose levels < 11 mmol/l. There was a significant delay in diagnosing DKA following admission with multiple consultant reviews. Detailed history revealed the recent addition of Canagliflozin (SGLT2 inhibitor). This can rarely be a precipitant of euglycaemic DKA. With appropriate DKA treatment, rapid correction of acidaemia and ketosis occurred allowing her to be discharged home within 24 hours.", "id": "29300799", "date": null, "title": "Euglycaemic DKA secondary to Canaglifozin, an easily missed diagnosis.", "doi": null, "journal": ["Acute medicine", "Acute Med"]}
