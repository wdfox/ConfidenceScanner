Repeated silica gel and sephadex LH 20 column chromatographies of bioactive fractions afforded stigmasterol, quercetin and avicularin as digestive enzymes inhibitors whose IC50 values as compared to acarbose (351.02\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.46\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0mL-1) were found to be as 91.08\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.54, 75.16\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.92 and 481.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.703\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0mL-1, respectively. In conclusion, M. pudica could be a good and safe source of digestive enzymes inhibitors for the management of diabetes in future.", "id": "29281898", "date": "2017-12-27", "title": "\u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors isolated from Mimosa pudica L.", "doi": "10.1080/14786419.2017.1419224", "journal": ["Natural product research", "Nat.
