Resting energy expenditure and body composition were measured in the first trimester, second trimester, third trimester, and postpartum.A total of 144 women participated in this study: 103 with normal glucose tolerance and 41 with diabetes. The resting energy expenditure (kcal/day) of pregnant women with normal glucose tolerance was significantly higher in the third trimester (1644 \u00b1 234) than in the first (1461 \u00b1 215) and second trimesters (1491 \u00b1 219) and postpartum (1419 \u00b1 254), whereas that of pregnant women with diabetes did not significantly change during all periods (1568 \u00b1 404, 1710 \u00b1 332, 1716 \u00b1 251, 1567 \u00b1 249). The resting energy expenditure of women with good glycemic control was lower than that of women with poor control. Fat-free mass was closely correlated with resting energy expenditure.The resting energy expenditure of Japanese pregnant women with normal glucose tolerance was significantly increased in the third trimester. The resting energy expenditure of women with good glycemic control was lower than that of women with poor control. Resting energy expenditure and fat-free mass are potential indexes for medical nutrition therapy in pregnant women with diabetes. This article is protected by copyright.
