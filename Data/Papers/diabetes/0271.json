Recently, it has been shown that clostripain (CP) may also contribute to efficient islet release from the human pancreas. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of these proteases on human islet integrity in a prospective approach. Islets were isolated from the pancreas of 10 brain-dead human organ donors. Purified islets were precultured for 3 to 4 d at 37 \u00b0C to ensure that preparations were cleared of predamaged islets, and only integral islets were subjected to 90 min of incubation at 37 \u00b0C in Hank's balanced salt solution supplemented with cNP, TL, or CP. The protease concentrations were calculated for a pancreas of 100 g trimmed weight utilizing 120 dimethyl-casein units of cNP, 70,000 caseinase units of TL, or 200 benzoyl-l-arginine-ethyl-ester units of CP (1\u00d7). These activities were then increased both 5\u00d7 and 10\u00d7. After subsequent 24-h culture in enzyme-free culture medium, treated islets were assessed and normalized to sham-treated controls. Compared with controls and CP, islet yield was significantly reduced by using the 5\u00d7 activity of cNP and TL, inducing also fragmentation and DNA release. Viability significantly decreased not until adding the 1\u00d7 activity of cNP, 5\u00d7 activity of TL, or 10\u00d7 activity of CP. Although mitochondrial function was significantly lowered by 1\u00d7 cNP and 5\u00d7 TL, CP did not affect mitochondria at any concentration. cNP- and TL-incubated islets significantly lost intracellular insulin already at 1\u00d7 activity, while the 10\u00d7 activity of CP had to be added to observe a similar effect. cNP and TL have a similar toxic potency regarding islet integrity. CP also induces adverse effects on islets, but the toxic threshold is generally higher. We hypothesize that CP can serve as supplementary protease to minimize cNP or TL activity for efficient pancreas digestion.", "id": "29338387", "date": null, "title": "Quantifying the Effects of Different Neutral Proteases on Human Islet Integrity.", "doi": "10.1177/0963689717727544", "journal": ["Cell transplantation", "Cell Transplant"]}
