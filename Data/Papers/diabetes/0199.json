A cross-sectional study was conducted among 197 type 2 diabetic patients, attending a diabetic clinic. Binary logistic regression models were used to identify perceived barriers. About 41% and 46% of the participants were noncompliant to diet and exercise advice, respectively; only 35.5% the participants were compliant to both. Perceived social acceptability (OR = 0.14; 95% CI: 0.03-0.58) and reminder to action (OR = 2.77; 95% CI: 1.38-5.53) were associated with noncompliance to diet. Most of the barriers to diet were related to taste, feast and festivals, lack of knowledge, and availability of healthy options. Self-efficacy (OR = 0.09; 95% CI: 0.02-0.34) and social acceptability (OR = 0.12; 95% CI: 0.04-0.34) were significant predictors of noncompliance to exercise. The supportive role of children and spouse and the opposing role of friends and relatives were important for compliance to both. A misconception on diabetes severity, effectiveness of healthy lifestyle, and exercise timing was prevalent among the study participants. Addressing the modifiable barriers identified in this study is essential for successful diabetes management in Nepal.", "id": "29349287", "date": "2017-11-14", "title": "Barriers to Diet and Exercise among Nepalese Type 2 Diabetic Patients.", "doi": "10.1155/2017/1273084", "journal": ["International scholarly research notices", "Int Sch Res Notices"]}
