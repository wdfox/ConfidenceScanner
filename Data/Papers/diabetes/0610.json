In this paper, we propose an incremental learning approach to apply a developed risk model on new patients with unknown predictor values, which imputes a patient's unknown values based on his/her k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) from the incremental population. We perform a real world case study by developing a risk prediction model of stroke for patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus from EHR data, and incrementally applying the risk model on a sequence of new patients. The experimental results show that our risk prediction model of stroke has good prediction performance. And the k-nearest neighbors based incremental learning approach for data imputation can gradually increase the prediction performance when the model is applied on new patients.", "id": "29295174", "date": null, "title": "Applying Risk Models on Patients with Unknown Predictor Values: An Incremental Learning Approach.", "doi": null, "journal": ["Studies in health technology and informatics", "Stud Health Technol Inform"]}
