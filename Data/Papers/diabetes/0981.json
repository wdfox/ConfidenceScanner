The only criteria that applies from the adult criteria is exclusion of other conditions that mimic PCOS. Clinical findings consistent with hyperandrogenaemia during adolescence include inflammatory acne, hirsutism, alopecia and/or menstrual irregularities, which are severe and present 2\u2009years after menarche. The measurement of androgen levels during adolescence should take into account age, puberty, type of androgen measured, assay used and diurnal rhythm. Multiple measurements are useful to demonstrate hyperandrogenaemia. The combination, severity and persistence of the hyperandrogenic symptoms and hyperandrogenaemia in girls 2\u2009years or more post-menarche support the diagnosis of adolescent PCOS. Adolescent girls with these findings should be followed up into adulthood.", "id": "29280221", "date": "2017-12-27", "title": "What is adolescent polycystic ovary syndrome?", "doi": "10.1111/jpc.13821", "journal": ["Journal of paediatrics and child health", "J Paediatr Child Health"]}
