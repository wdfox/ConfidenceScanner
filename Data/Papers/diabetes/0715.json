We hypothesized that magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) would detect attenuation of fibrosis following SW in unilateral ARAS kidneys.Domestic pigs were randomized to control, unilateral ARAS, and ARAS treated with 6 sessions of SW over 3 consecutive weeks (n\u00a0=\u00a07 each) starting after 3\u00a0weeks of ARAS or sham. Four weeks after SW treatment, renal fibrosis was evaluated with MRE in vivo or trichrome staining ex vivo. Blood pressure, single-kidney renal-blood-flow (RBF) and glomerular-filtration-rate (GFR) were assessed.MRE detected increased stiffness in the STK medulla (15.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.1 vs. 10.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8\u00a0kPa, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) that moderately correlated with severity of fibrosis (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.501, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), but did not identify mild STK cortical or contralateral kidney fibrosis. Trichrome staining showed that medullary fibrosis was increased in ARAS and alleviated by SW (10.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.8% vs. 2.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). SW slightly decreased blood pressure and normalized STK RBF and GFR in ARAS. In the contralateral kidney, SW reversed the increase in RBF and GFR.MRE might be a tool for noninvasive monitoring of medullary fibrosis in response to treatment in kidney disease.", "id": "29289980", "date": "2017-12-30", "title": "Magnetic resonance elastography can monitor changes in medullary stiffness in response to treatment in the swine ischemic kidney.", "doi": "10.1007/s10334-017-0671-7", "journal": ["Magma (New York, N.Y.)", "MAGMA"]}
