Additional factors include mucin and inflammatory changes in the gallbladder, slow intestinal motility, increased intestinal absorption of cholesterol, and altered gut microbiota. Mechanisms of disease are linked with insulin resistance, obesity, the metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes. The role of nuclear receptors, signaling pathways, gut microbiota, and epigenome are being actively investigated.Ongoing research on cholesterol gallstone disease is intensively investigating several pathogenic mechanisms, associated metabolic disorders, new therapeutic approaches, and novel strategies for primary prevention, including lifestyles.", "id": "29283909", "date": "2017-12-27", "title": "An update on the pathogenesis of cholesterol gallstone disease.", "doi": "10.1097/MOG.0000000000000423", "journal": ["Current opinion in gastroenterology", "Curr.
