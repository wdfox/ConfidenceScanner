From the first serum creatinine value from 2006 to 2012 and a urine-albumin creatinine ratio (UACR) recorded within 6months, we applied baseline Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) categories of eGFR and albuminuria. We followed patients for up to 11years to calculate adjusted incidence per1000\u00a0person-years (p-y) of first CVD hospitalization and all-cause mortality.Over 98,069p-y of follow-up, CVD hospitalization risk was greater for each higher eGFR and albuminuria category. In eGFR category G2 (60-89mL/min/1.73m2), adjusted incidence per 1000p-y was 14.1 (95% CI 12.9-15.5), 19.8 (17.2-22.8), and 22.8 (17.4-30.0) for normoalbuminuria, microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria, respectively. For eGFR category G3a (45-59), rates were 26.7 (22.3-32.0), 40.3 (32.2-50.5), and 44.1 (28.8-67.4), respectively. Adjusted risk of all-cause mortality followed a similar pattern.Our data underscore the importance of including detailed eGFR and UACR values in assessing CVD risk. High albuminuria and low eGFR is a potent predictor of CVD and death.", "id": "29352693", "date": "2017-12-18", "title": "The association between estimated glomerular filtration rate, albuminuria, and risk of cardiovascular hospitalizations and all-cause mortality among patients with type 2 diabetes.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jdiacomp.2017.12.003", "journal": ["Journal of diabetes and its complications", "J.
