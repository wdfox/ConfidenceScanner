We aimed to perform a systematic review on the prevalence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in Iran based on Persian and English papers had been published from 1985 to 2015. Among 267 initially found articles, 142 were excluded; finally, a total number of 40 articles were found relevant which were reduced to 18. Smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hypercholesterolemia were the most common risk factors for AMI. Premature MI prevalence was high in men, and smoking was the most common risk factor among young people. People in urban areas were more likely to experience AMI than rural people. The prevalence of AMI in Iran is high and has increased in recent years. Therefore, to restrain the rising trend of AMI, it is necessary to make the primary and secondary prevention efforts.", "id": "29326775", "date": null, "title": "A Systematic Review on the Prevalence of Acute Myocardial Infarction in Iran.", "doi": "10.4103/HEARTVIEWS.HEARTVIEWS_71_17", "journal": ["Heart views : the official journal of the Gulf Heart Association", "Heart Views"]}
