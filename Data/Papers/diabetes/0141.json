We investigated mortality in patients with diabetes included in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, in relation to baseline RDW. RDW was divided into 4 quartiles (Q1: \u226412.4%, Q2: 12.5%-12.9%, Q3: 13.0%-13.7%, and Q4: >13.7%).A total of 3,061 patients were included: mean age 61 \u00b1 14 years, 50% male, 39% White. Mean RDW was 13.2% \u00b1 1.4%. Compared with first quartile (Q1) of RDW, patients in Q4 were more likely to be older, female, and African-American, have had history of stroke, myocardial infarction, and heart failure, and have chronic kidney disease. After a median follow-up of 6 years, 628 patient died (29% of cardiovascular disease). Compared with Q1, patients in Q4 were at increased risk for all-cause mortality (HR 3.44 [2.74-4.32], P < .001) and cardiovascular mortality (HR 3.34 [2.16-5.17], P < .001). After adjusting for 17 covariates, RDW in Q4 remained significantly associated with all-cause mortality (HR 2.39 [1.30-4.38], P = 0.005) and cardiovascular mortality (HR 1.99 [1.17-3.37], P = 0.011).RDW is a powerful and an independent marker for prediction of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality in patients with diabetes.", "id": "29359154", "date": "2017-11-21", "title": "Red Cell Distribution Width Is Associated with All-Cause and Cardiovascular Mortality in Patients with Diabetes.", "doi": "10.1155/2017/5843702", "journal": ["BioMed research international", "Biomed Res Int"]}
