Data were analyzed using SPSS version 20.0 for descriptive analysis and Mplus version 7.4 for latent class analysis.Four latent classes of risk factors for coronary artery disease were identified in the final model: 'smoking-drinking', 'high-risk for dyslipidemia', 'high-risk for metabolic syndrome', and 'high-risk for diabetes and malnutrition'. The likelihood of these latent classes varied significantly based on socio-demographic characteristics, including age, gender, educational level, and occupation.The results showed significant heterogeneity in the pattern of risk factors for coronary artery disease. These findings provide helpful data to develop intervention strategies for the effective prevention of coronary artery disease. Specific characteristics depending on the subpopulation should be considered during the development of interventions.", "id": "29326412", "date": null, "title": "[Identifying Latent Classes of Risk Factors for Coronary Artery Disease].", "doi": "10.4040/jkan.2017.47.6.817", "journal": ["Journal of Korean Academy of Nursing", "J Korean Acad Nurs"]}
