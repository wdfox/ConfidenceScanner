The average ages of CVD deaths for African Americans with 1 and 2 APOL1 risk alleles were, respectively, 7.0 years (P\u00a0= 0.02) and 12.2 years (P\u00a0< 0.01) younger than African Americans with 0 risk alleles and 8.7 years (P\u00a0= 0.01) and 13.9 years (P\u00a0= 0.01) younger than whites. Age differences were not significant between African Americans and whites with 0 risk alleles (P\u00a0= 0.61). The younger CVD deaths of African Americans were associated with less severe glomerulosclerosis with 2 (P\u00a0= 0.01), although not 1 (P\u00a0= 0.09), compared with 0 APOL1 risk alleles. Cardiomyopathy was found in 23% of African Americans with 1 and 2 risk alleles and significantly contributed to the lower age (P\u00a0= 0.01). For non-CVD deaths, age differences were not seen by race (P\u00a0= 0.28) or among African Americans by risk allele status (P\u00a0= 0.38).Carriage of 1 or 2 APOL1 risk alleles in African Americans was associated with earlier age\u00a0deaths due to coronary artery disease and cardiomyopathy. For 2 risk alleles, the early age was independent of nephrosclerosis.", "id": "29340318", "date": "2017-08-24", "title": "APOL1 Risk Variants Independently Associated With Early Cardiovascular Disease Death.", "doi": "10.1016/j.ekir.2017.08.007", "journal": ["Kidney international reports", "Kidney Int Rep"]}
