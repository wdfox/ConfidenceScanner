The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects of exendin-4 in mice receiving D-galactose, a reducing sugar that triggers ROS production and inflammatory mediators affecting the pancreas and liver. Exendin-4 is an United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved glucagon-like peptide that increases insulin dependent glycogen synthesis and glucose uptake. Male NMRI mice (20-25\u00a0g), 3\u00a0months of age, were randomly divided into 6 groups of 12 mice each: control, exendin-4 (1\u00a0nmol/kg), exendin-4 (10\u00a0nmol/kg), D-galactose, D-galactose\u00a0+\u00a0exendin-4 (1\u00a0nmol/kg) and D-galactose\u00a0+\u00a0exendin-4 (10\u00a0nmol/kg). D-galactose (500\u00a0mg/kg) was given daily by oral gavage for 6\u00a0weeks. During the last 10\u00a0days, exendin-4 (1 and 10\u00a0nmol/kg) was injected intraperitoneally daily. Glucose, insulin, insulin resistance, lipid profiles, and hepatic enzyme levels significantly increased in the D-galactose group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), along with a significant decrease in superoxide dismutase activity and pancreatic islet insulin secretion (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Exendin-4 decreased D-galactose-induced increases in serum glucose and insulin, insulin resistance, lipid profiles, and hepatic enzymes, and improved pancreatic islet insulin secretion and antioxidant defense status. The results show that exendin-4 can prevent complications in mice with compromised pancreatic and hepatic function. Long term administration of D-galactose in mice may be a useful model to study insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and aging.", "id": "29321828", "date": "2017-12-26", "title": "Exendin-4 protects mice from D-galactose-induced hepatic and pancreatic dysfunction.", "doi": "10.1080/20010001.2017.1418593", "journal": ["Pathobiology of aging & age related diseases", "Pathobiol Aging Age Relat Dis"]}
