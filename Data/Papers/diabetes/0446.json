It is suggested that the serum levels of Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1 (ICAM-1) is correlated with diabetic nephropathy. In this cross-sectional study, we evaluated serum ICAM-1 level in diabetic patients with and without MA.A total of 187 participants were enrolled and were classified into three groups including 40 healthy controls and 2 diabetic groups with (n\u202f=\u202f59) or without MA (n\u202f=\u202f88). Serum levels of ICAM-1, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, very low density lipoprotein cholesterol and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured in all three groups. Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS software. A P-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.Serum levels of ICAM-1 were significantly higher in diabetic patients irrespective of MA. Moreover, ICAM-1 levels in patients with MA were significantly higher than patients without MA. Patients with MA had significantly higher age and blood pressure compared to those without MA (P\u202f=\u202f0.001). Serum levels of ICAM-1 were significantly correlated with age and HbA1c.Overall, serum ICAM-1 levels were significantly higher in T2DM patients with MA and it may be associated with the severity of diabetic kidney disease.", "id": "29310968", "date": "2017-12-28", "title": "Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 in diabetic patients with and without microalbuminuria.", "doi": "10.1016/j.dsx.2017.12.028", "journal": ["Diabetes & metabolic syndrome", "Diabetes Metab Syndr"]}
