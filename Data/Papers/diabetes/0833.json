Several studies conducted in different populations indicate that neck circumference (NC) can be used as a simple measure of overweight and obesity. This study was conducted to evaluate NC as a marker of overweight and obesity and to determine respective cutoff values for Bangladeshi male and female participants.This cross-sectional observational study was conducted with during July 2013-June 2014 among randomly selected 871 Bangladeshi participants (male = 496 [56.9%], female = 375 [43.1%], aged >18 years) who visited Outpatient Department of United Hospital, Bangladesh Institute of Research and Rehabilitation in Diabetes, Endocrine and Metabolic disorders, primary health-care centers located in Dhaka, Savar, Gazipur. NC of participants was taken in centimeter to the nearest 1 mm, using plastic tape measure. Main outcome included NC, waist circumferences (WC), body mass index (BMI), and waist: hip ratio (WHR).Pearson's correlation coefficients indicated a significant association between NC and height (men, r = 0.33; women, r = 0.28; P < 0.0001), weight (men, r = 0.61; women, r = 0.55; P < 0.0001), BMI (men, r = 0.51; women, r = 0.41; P < 0.0001), WC (men, r = 0.61; women, r = 0.46; P < 0.0001), hip circumference (men, r = 0.61; women, r = 0.44; P < 0.0001), WHR (men, r = 0.22; women, r = 0.18; P < 0.0001). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that NC \u226534.75 cm in men (area under curve [AUC]: 0.77; P < 0.001) and \u226531.75 cm in women (AUC: 0.62; P < 0.001) were the best cutoff value for BMI \u226523 (overweight). NC \u226535.25 cm in men (AUC: 0.82; P < 0.001) and NC \u226534.25 cm in women (AUC: 0.76; P < 0.001) were the best cutoff value for BMI \u226527.5 (obesity). NC \u226535.25 cm in male (AUC: 0.83; P < 0.001) and NC \u226531.25 cm in women (AUC: 0.65; P < 0.001) were the best cutoff value for WC >90 cm in men and > 80 cm in women, respectively. NC \u226534.45 cm in male (AUC: 0.59; P = 0.001) and NC \u226531.25 cm in women (AUC: 0.66; P = 0.008) were the best cutoff value for WHR >0.9 in men and >0.8 in women, respectively.NC measurement is a simple, convenient, inexpensive screening measure to identify overweight and obese participants. Men with NC \u226534.75 cm and women with NC \u226531.75 cm are to be considered overweight while men with NC \u226535.25 cm and women with NC \u226534.25 cm are to be considered obese. NC \u226535.25 cm in male and NC \u226531.25 cm in women were the best cutoff value for abdominal obesity.", "id": "29285438", "date": null, "title": "Neck Circumference as a Marker of Overweight and Obesity and Cutoff Values for Bangladeshi Adults.", "doi": "10.4103/ijem.IJEM_196_17", "journal": ["Indian journal of endocrinology and metabolism", "Indian J Endocrinol Metab"]}
