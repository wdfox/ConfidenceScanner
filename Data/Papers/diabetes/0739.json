Prediabetes was defined as fasting plasma glucose (FPG) 5.6-6.9mmol/l or HbA1c 5.7-6.4% (39-46mmol/mol). Insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and beta-cell function (HOMA-%B) indices were assessed by homeostasis model assessment. Incident diabetes was defined as FPG \u2265 7.0mmol/l, HbA1c \u2265 6.5% (48mmol/mol), or initiation of antidiabetic medications.Among the 7,208 participants with prediabetes, 4,410 (61.2%) remained as prediabetes (control group), 2,123 (29.5%) reverted to normal glucose regulation (regressors), and 675 (9.4%) progressed to type 2 diabetes (progressors) after 5 years. Compared with the control group, the progressors had higher baseline HOMA-IR (2.48 \u00b1 1.45 versus 2.06 \u00b1 1.20, P < 0.001), but similar baseline HOMA-%B (74.6 \u00b1 47.6 versus 73.1 \u00b1 41.4, P=0.68). By contrast, the regressors had lower baseline HOMA-IR (1.98 \u00b1 1.14 versus 2.06 \u00b1 1.20, P = 0.035) but higher baseline HOMA-%B (77.4 \u00b1 43.1 versus 73.1 \u00b1 41.4, P = 0.001). After 5 years, the progressors showed a 31% increase in HOMA-IR (2.48 \u00b1 1.45 versus 3.24 \u00b1 2.10, P < 0.001) and 15% decrease in HOMA-%B (74.6 \u00b1 47.6 versus 63.8 \u00b1 40.4, P < 0.001), whereas the regressors showed 29% decrease in HOMA-IR (1.98 \u00b1 1.14 versus 1.41 \u00b1 0.78, P < 0.001) and 4% increase in HOMA-%B (77.4 \u00b1 43.1 versus 80.2 \u00b1 47.9, P = 0.010).Although increase in insulin resistance and decrease in beta-cell function both contributed to the progression to type 2 diabetes from prediabetes, longitudinal change in insulin resistance was the predominant factor in Koreans.", "id": "29289263", "date": "2017-09-28", "title": "Longitudinal Changes in Insulin Resistance, Beta-Cell Function and Glucose Regulation Status in Prediabetes.", "doi": "10.1016/j.amjms.2017.09.010", "journal": ["The American journal of the medical sciences", "Am.
