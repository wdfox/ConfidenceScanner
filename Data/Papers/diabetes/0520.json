The prevalence of self-care practices and their sociodemographic risk was analyzed.Maximum adherence was seen for blood sugar testing (77.91%), and least adherence was seen for diet (12.26%). Adherence to exercise was 30.67%, adherence to foot care was 48.46%, and adherence to medication was 60.73%. Some of the sociodemographic factors associated with good self-care practices are young age, gender, formal education, occupation, and religion. Good adherence to medication is associated with better control of blood sugars.A clinician should be able to identify these risk factors and give special attention to these groups of patients and make realistic recommendations for self-care activities.", "id": "29302521", "date": null, "title": "Prevalence of self-care practices and assessment of their sociodemographic risk factors among diabetes in the urban slums of Bengaluru.", "doi": "10.4103/2249-4863.220037", "journal": ["Journal of family medicine and primary care", "J Family Med Prim Care"]}
