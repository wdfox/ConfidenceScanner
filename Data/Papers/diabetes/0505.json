The mammalian sirtuin family consists of seven sirtuins (SIRT1-7). Recent findings have identified critical roles for SIRT1 and SIRT7 in glucose/lipid metabolism in multiple tissues. This review focuses on the metabolic roles of these two sirtuins and the benefits of modulating the activity of sirtuins for the treatment of metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes.", "id": "29305011", "date": "2017-08-30", "title": "Transcriptional Regulation of Metabolism by SIRT1 and SIRT7.", "doi": "10.1016/bs.ircmb.2017.07.009", "journal": ["International review of cell and molecular biology", "Int Rev Cell Mol Biol"]}
