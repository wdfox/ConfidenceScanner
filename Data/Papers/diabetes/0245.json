To uncover the anti-cancer mechanisms of metformin, preclinical studies determined that metformin impairs cellular metabolism and suppresses oncogenic signaling pathways, including receptor tyrosine kinase, PI3K/Akt, and mTOR pathways. Recently, the anti-cancer potential of metformin has gained increasing interest due to its inhibitory effects on cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are associated with tumor metastasis, drug resistance, and relapse. Studies using various cancer models, including breast, pancreatic, prostate, and colon, have demonstrated the potency of metformin in attenuating CSCs through the targeting of specific pathways involved in cell differentiation, renewal, metastasis, and metabolism. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the anti-cancer actions and mechanisms of metformin, including the regulation of CSCs and related pathways. We also discuss the potential anti-cancer applications of metformin as mono- or combination therapies.", "id": "29342230", "date": "2017-10-07", "title": "Metformin as an anti-cancer agent: actions and mechanisms targeting cancer stem cells.", "doi": "10.1093/abbs/gmx106", "journal": ["Acta biochimica et biophysica Sinica", "Acta Biochim.
