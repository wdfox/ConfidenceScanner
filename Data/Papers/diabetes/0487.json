It exists in two isoforms, GSK-3\u03b1 and GSK-3\u03b2 and can phosphorylate a wide range of substrates. Aberrancy in the GSK-3 activity can lead to various diseases like Alzheimer's, diabetes, cancer, neurodegeneration etc., rendering it an attractive target to develop potent and specific inhibitors. The present review focuses on the recent developments in the area of GSK-3 inhibitors and also enlightens its therapeutic applicability in various disease conditions.", "id": "29306837", "date": "2017-12-09", "title": "Glycogen synthase kinase-3 and its inhibitors: Potential target for various therapeutic conditions.", "doi": "10.1016/j.ejmech.2017.11.103", "journal": ["European journal of medicinal chemistry", "Eur J Med Chem"]}
