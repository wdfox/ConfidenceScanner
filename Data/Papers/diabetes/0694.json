However, in contrast to the saturated FA (SFA) palmitic acid, the monounsaturated FA (MUFA) oleic acid elicits beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity, and the dietary palmitic acid:oleic acid ratio impacts diabetes risk in humans. Here we review recent mechanistic insights into the beneficial effects of oleic acid compared with palmitic acid on insulin resistance and T2DM, including its anti-inflammatory actions, and its capacity to inhibit endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, prevent attenuation of the insulin signaling pathway, and improve \u03b2 cell survival. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of the antidiabetic effects of oleic acid may contribute to understanding the benefits of this FA in the prevention or delay of T2DM.", "id": "29290500", "date": "2017-12-28", "title": "Palmitic and Oleic Acid: The Yin and Yang of Fatty Acids in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.", "doi": "10.1016/j.tem.2017.11.009", "journal": ["Trends in endocrinology and metabolism: TEM", "Trends Endocrinol.
