However, the precise mechanisms that allow thymic escape and peripheral activation of beta cell antigen-specific T cells are still largely unknown. Studies performed with the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse have challenged several immunological dogmas, and have made the NOD mouse a key experimental system to study the steps of immunodysregulation that lead to autoimmune diabetes. The structural similarities between the NOD I-Ag7 and HLA-DQ8 have revealed the stability of the T cell receptor (TCR)/HLA/peptide tri-molecular complex as an important parameter in the development of autoimmune T cells, as well as afforded insights into the key antigens targeted in T1D. In this review, we will provide a summary of the current understanding with regard to autoimmune T cell development, the significance of the antigens targeted in T1D, and the relationship between TCR affinity and immune regulation.", "id": "29312143", "date": "2017-12-14", "title": "Understanding Autoimmune Diabetes through the Prism of the Tri-Molecular Complex.", "doi": "10.3389/fendo.2017.00351", "journal": ["Frontiers in endocrinology", "Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)"]}
