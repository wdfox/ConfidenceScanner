We now examine the prognostic significance of HBP variability in substantially the same cohort.We performed a prospective cohort study of type 2 diabetes patients. We analyzed 714 patients. Major exclusion criteria are missing data of urinary albumin excretion and newly prescribed or stopped renin-angiotensin system inhibitors during 2-year follow-up. Patients were instructed to perform triplicate morning and evening HBP measurements for 14 consecutive days. We computed day-by-day HBP variability as within-patient standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation (CV) of measurements.During the follow-up period of 2 years, 23 patients progressed to macroalbuminuria. The changing risk of progression to macroalbuminuria with increasing day-by-day variability of morning SBP was better depicted using smoothing spline analyses. Patients with greater SD of morning SBP tended to significantly progress to macroalbuminuria [odds ratio: 5.24 (95% confidence interval: 2.10-13.03; P\u200a>\u200a0.001)]. Patients with greater CV of morning SBP also tended to significantly progress to macroalbuminuria [odds ratio: 3.36 (95% confidence interval: 1.39-8.12; P\u200a=\u200a0.007)].Day-by-day variability of morning SBP was proven as an independent predictor for progression to macroalbuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes.", "id": "29283972", "date": "2017-12-27", "title": "Prognostic significance of day-by-day variability of home blood pressure on progression to macroalbuminuria in patients with diabetes.", "doi": "10.1097/HJH.0000000000001657", "journal": ["Journal of hypertension", "J.
