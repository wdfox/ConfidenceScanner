The mutual influence of the microbiome and the immune system of the host constitute the basis for numerous diseases, e.g. pseudomembranous colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, type 1 diabetes, atopic diseases, obesity, reactive arthritis. New molecular diagnostic methods and multi-center studies may help in understanding of the role of microbiota in health and disease. Rheumatoid arthritis has a multi-faceted etiology, and its causes are not entirely understood. There are indications for the influence of microbiomes of oral cavity, intestines, lungs and urinary tract on the development of rheumatoid arthritis. Interactions between microorganisms and human immune system play role in the pathogenesis of the disease.", "id": "29332963", "date": "2017-10-28", "title": "Role of human microbiome and selected bacterial infections in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis.", "doi": "10.5114/reum.2017.71641", "journal": ["Reumatologia", "Reumatologia"]}
