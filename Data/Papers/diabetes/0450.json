Patients who underwent esophagectomy often have a serum potassium level due to perioperative reduced intake, fluids loss, consumption and other reasons. These patients often require the artificial administration of potassium. Rapid fluid loss and physiological consumption lead to the deficiency of potassium, even hypokalemia. Patients often require the addition of a large amount of potassium after operation. The occurrence of hyperkalemia after esophagectomy is never been reported.The patient presented with continuous tachycardia, palpitations, chest tightness, progressive nausea, irritability, progressive myasthenia gravis.Hyperkalemia, sepsis, acidosis, diabetes, postoperative esophageal cancer.Prompt anti-infection treatment and the management of blood sugar, hemodialysis was performed to correct sthe acidosis and electrolyte disorder OUTCOMES:: All symptoms were alleviated.Therefore, there is a need to regularly test electrolytes, especially in patients with diabetes, as well as better blood glucose control. Attention should be paid to the potential of infection, and to avoiding ketoacidosis and risk of sepsis.", "id": "29310400", "date": null, "title": "Clinical analysis of hyperkalemia after esophagectomy: A case report.", "doi": "10.1097/MD.0000000000008966", "journal": ["Medicine", "Medicine (Baltimore)"]}
