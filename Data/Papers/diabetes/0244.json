The purpose of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of Portulaca oleracea L. (purslane) on streptozotocin-induced diabetes in mice. Oral glucose-tolerance tests were carried out to assess blood glucose levels and body weight and food intake were recorded. The biochemical parameters anti-aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, insulin, triglycerides, total cholesterol, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and TNF\u03b1 were also measured. The pathological condition of liver tissues were examined by hematoxylin-eosin staining. Rho, ROCK1, ROCK2, NF\u03baBp65, p-NF\u03baBp65, I\u03baB\u03b1, and p-I\u03baB\u03b1 expression in liver tissue were analyzed by Western blot. Purslane increased body weight and decreased food intake. Purslane also significantly reduced concentrations of glucose, anti-aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, triglycerides, total cholesterol, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and TNF\u03b1 in serum. Serum insulin was elevated with purslane treatment. In addition, pathologic liver changes in diabetic mice were also alleviated by purslane. Obtained data revealed that purslane restored the levels of Rho-NF\u03baB signaling-related proteins in comparison with those of diabetic mice. Above all, it can be assumed that purslane might play a positive role in regulating streptozotocin-induced liver injury through suppressing the Rho-NF\u03baB pathway.", "id": "29343942", "date": "2017-12-28", "title": "Portulaca oleracea L. alleviates liver injury in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice.", "doi": "10.2147/DDDT.S121084", "journal": ["Drug design, development and therapy", "Drug Des Devel Ther"]}
