Central to the process of glucose homeostasis are pancreatic \u03b2 cells, which sense elevations in plasma glucose and additional dietary components and respond by releasing the appropriate quantity of insulin, ensuring the arrest of hepatic glucose output and glucose uptake in peripheral tissues. Given that \u03b2 cell failure is associated with the transition from prediabetes to diabetes, improved \u03b2 cell function ('compensation') has a central role in preventing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Recent data have shown that both insulin secretion and \u03b2 cell mass dynamics are regulated by the liver kinase B1-AMP-activated kinase (LKB1-AMPK) pathway and related kinases of the AMPK family; thus, an improved understanding of the biological roles of AMPK in the \u03b2 cell is now of considerable interest.", "id": "29289437", "date": "2017-12-27", "title": "AMPK and Friends: Central Regulators of \u03b2 Cell Biology.", "doi": "10.1016/j.tem.2017.11.007", "journal": ["Trends in endocrinology and metabolism: TEM", "Trends Endocrinol.
