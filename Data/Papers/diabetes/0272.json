The aim of this study was to determine whether mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) isolated from different sources, (bone marrow [BM-MSCs] and adipose tissue [ADSCs]), differ in their potential to regenerate smooth muscles in tissue-engineered urinary bladders and to determine an optimal number of MSCs for urinary bladder smooth muscle regeneration. Forty-eight rats underwent hemicystectomy and bladder augmentation with approximately 0.8 cm2 graft. In the first and second groups, urinary bladders were reconstructed with small intestinal submucosa (SIS) seeded with 10 \u00d7 106 or 4 \u00d7 106 ADSCs/cm2, respectively. In the third and fourth groups, urinary bladders were augmented with SIS seeded with 10 \u00d7 106 or 4 \u00d7 106 BM-MSCs/cm2, respectively. In the fifth group, urinary bladders were augmented with SIS without cells. The sixth group (control) was left intact. Smooth muscle regeneration was evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and histological examinations. Histologically, there were no significant differences between urinary bladders augmented with ADSCs and BM-MSCs, but there was a marked increase in smooth muscle formation in bladders augmented with grafts seeded with MSCs in higher density (10 \u00d7 106/cm2) compared to lower density (4 \u00d7 106/cm2). Molecular analysis revealed that bladders reconstructed with ADSC-seeded grafts expressed higher levels of smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, caldesmon, and vinculin. Bladders augmented with unseeded SIS were fibrotic and devoid of smooth muscles. ADSCs and BM-MSCs have comparable smooth muscle regenerative potential, but the number of MSCs used for graft preparation significantly affects the smooth muscle content in tissue-engineered urinary bladders.", "id": "29338385", "date": null, "title": "Does the Mesenchymal Stem Cell Source Influence Smooth Muscle Regeneration in Tissue-Engineered Urinary Bladders?", "doi": "10.1177/0963689717722787", "journal": ["Cell transplantation", "Cell Transplant"]}
