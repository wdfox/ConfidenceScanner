Therapeutic target against endothelial injury may provide critical venues for treatment of diabetic vascular diseases. We recently identified that salusin-\u03b2 contributed to high glucose-induced endothelial cell apoptosis. However, the roles of salusin-\u03b2 in DM-induced endothelial dysfunction remain largely elusive. Male C57BL/6J mice were used to induce type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) model. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were cultured in high glucose/high fat (HG/HF) medium. We demonstrated increased expression of salusin-\u03b2 in diabetic aortic tissues and high-glucose/high-fat- (HG/HF-) incubated HUVECs. Disruption of salusin-\u03b2 by shRNA abrogated the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, inflammation, and nitrotyrosine content of HUVECs cultured in HG/HF medium. The HG/HF-mediated decrease in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) expression was restored by salusin-\u03b2 shRNA, and PPAR\u03b3 inhibitor T0070907 abolished the protective actions of salusin-\u03b2 shRNA on endothelial injury in HG/HF-treated HUVECs. Salusin-\u03b2 silencing obviously improved endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation, oxidative stress, inflammatory response, and nitrative stress in diabetic aorta. Taken together, our results highlighted the essential role of salusin-\u03b2 in pathological endothelial dysfunction, and salusin-\u03b2 may be a promising target in treatment of vascular complications of DM.", "id": "29359008", "date": "2017-11-19", "title": "Salusin-\u03b2 Is Involved in Diabetes Mellitus-Induced Endothelial Dysfunction via Degradation of Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma.", "doi": "10.1155/2017/6905217", "journal": ["Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity", "Oxid Med Cell Longev"]}
