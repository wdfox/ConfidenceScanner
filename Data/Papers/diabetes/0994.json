Several causes such as aging, bladder outlet obstruction, diabetes mellitus, neurologic disorders, and nervous injury to the spinal cord, cauda equine, and peripheral pelvic nerve have been assumed to be responsible for the development of UAB. Several contributing factors have been suggested in the pathophysiology of UAB, including myogenic failure, efferent and/or afferent dysfunctions, and central nervous system dysfunction. In this review article, we have described relationships between individual contributing factors and the pathophysiology of UAB based on previous reports. However, many pathophysiological uncertainties still remain, which require more investigations using appropriate animal models.", "id": "29279880", "date": "2017-11-13", "title": "Pathophysiology of the underactive bladder.", "doi": "10.4111/icu.2017.58.S2.S82", "journal": ["Investigative and clinical urology", "Investig Clin Urol"]}
