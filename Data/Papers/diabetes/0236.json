A sample of 3 ml blood was taken to measure the HbA1c, and patients were asked to fill out a pretested questionnaire. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions, to identify independent factors associated with good glycemic control, were conducted using SPSS software version 22 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA).Mean [\u00b1standard deviation (SD)] of HbA1c was 8.97 (2.02) and one fifth of patients had good glycemic control (HbA1c \u2a7d 7%). Factors associated with good glycemic control were: older age [odds ratio (OR) = 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.933-0.988), high medication adherence (OR: 2.757, 95% CI: 1.308-4.693), and better health literacy (OR= 2.124, 95% CI: 1.917-4.921). Duration of diabetes mellitus (DM > 7 years) was inversely related to good glycemic control (OR = 2.255, 95% CI: 1.189-4.276).Our study showed that glycemic control was suboptimal, and factors associated with that were: older age, high medication adherence, and better health literacy. Knowledge of these factors could be an entry toward helping patients and targeting interventions to improve glycemic control and prevent diabetes-related complications.", "id": "29344335", "date": "2017-12-05", "title": "Glycemic control among primary care patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in the Gaza Strip, Palestine.", "doi": "10.1177/2042018817742070", "journal": ["Therapeutic advances in endocrinology and metabolism", "Ther Adv Endocrinol Metab"]}
