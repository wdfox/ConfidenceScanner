The coronary heart disease risk was calculated using Framingham risk score.The body mass index in men and women decreased from 43.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.9, 39.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.0\u00a0kg/m2 preoperatively to 32.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.7, 31.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.2\u00a0kg/m2 and to 30.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.6\u00a0, 28.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.7\u00a0kg/m2, respectively, at 6 and 12\u00a0months after surgery (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). At 6 and 12\u00a0months after LSG, there was a marked improvement on lipid profile as well as a significant decline in the prevalence of diabetes mellitus, systemic hypertension, and smoking. The Framingham risk score in men and women reduced from 3.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.7, 6.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.7 preoperatively to 1.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.9, 3.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.9 and 0.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.2, 2.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.1, respectively, at 6 and 12\u00a0months after surgery (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001).Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is efficient not only in the reduction of obesity and its related comorbidities but also in decreasing the long-term coronary event risk. Early intervention for the high-risk group is strongly recommended.", "id": "29282509", "date": "2017-12-28", "title": "Predicted Coronary Heart Disease Risk Decreases in Obese Patients After Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy.", "doi": "10.1007/s00268-017-4416-6", "journal": ["World journal of surgery", "World J Surg"]}
