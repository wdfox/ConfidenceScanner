Here, in this study, we aimed to comprehensively investigate the effects of curcumin on glycolipid metabolism in vivo and in vitro and then determine the underlying mechanism. Male C57BL/6\u2009J obese mice and 3T3-L1 adipocytes were used for in vivo and in vitro study, respectively. Our results demonstrated that treatment with curcumin for eight weeks decreased body weight, fat mass and serum lipid profiles. Meanwhile, it lowered fasting blood glucose and increased the insulin sensitivity in high-fat diet-induced obese mice. In addition, curcumin stimulated lipolysis and improved glycolipid metabolism through upregulating the expressions of adipose triglyceride lipase and hormone-sensitive lipase, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor \u03b3/\u03b1 (PPAR\u03b3/\u03b1) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein\u03b1 (C/EBP\u03b1) in adipose tissue of the mice. In differentiated 3T3-L1 cells, curcumin reduced glycerol release and increased glucose uptake via upregulating PPAR\u03b3 and C/EBP\u03b1. We concluded that curcumin has the potential to improve glycolipid metabolism disorders caused by obesity through regulating PPAR\u03b3 signalling pathway.", "id": "29291086", "date": "2017-11-15", "title": "Curcumin improves glycolipid metabolism through regulating peroxisome proliferator activated receptor \u03b3 signalling pathway in high-fat diet-induced obese mice and 3T3-L1 adipocytes.", "doi": "10.1098/rsos.170917", "journal": ["Royal Society open science", "R Soc Open Sci"]}
