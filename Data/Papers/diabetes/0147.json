Sensory evaluation was conducted within diabetic (DB) and non-diabetic (NDB) consumers by preference ranking and acceptance test. The formulations were analysed in terms of moisture, ash, protein, lipid, carbohydrates, fibers and mineral content. The consumers did not distinguish the formulations by preference ranking test. However, the acceptability test showed a rating of 9 most frequent for PB1 (36.30%), followed by PB2 and PB3 (both 34.09%), among DB consumers. The PB1 and PB3 showed higher content of total, soluble and insoluble fibers and, PB 2 presented higher carbohydrate content. Potassium, sodium and calcium showed the highest mineral content in the formulations. PB3 was assessed for glycaemic and lipidemic control in diabetics and non-diabetics female Wistar rats, for this 20% of PB was added in the ration consumed ad libitum, besides, the rats received 100\u00a0mg/kg b. w. by gavage daily. The treatment did not reduce significantly fasting glucose, lipid profile, or peripheral glucose disposal in DB or NDB rats. However, it significantly improved insulin tolerance test values in diabetic rats. The results suggest that the formulations showed good acceptance and potentially ameliorate insulin resistance both in control group and in animal model of type II diabetes.", "id": "29358792", "date": "2017-11-04", "title": "Novel soybean-based high protein bar rich in isoflavones improves insulin sensitivity in diabetic Wistar rats.", "doi": "10.1007/s13197-017-2753-y", "journal": ["Journal of food science and technology", "J Food Sci Technol"]}
