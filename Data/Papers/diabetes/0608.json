Current data displays are not optimized to support insulin management by end users. We sought to develop a set of user-centered displays of capillary glucose data and insulin dose to improve inpatient management of IDD. Our proposed conceptual data display prototype is designed to simplify the presentation and visualization of key information needed for treatment decisions. The goal is also to enhance clinician's ability to identify opportunities to optimize insulin dosing and decrease end users' cognitive load and error rates.", "id": "29295184", "date": null, "title": "A User-Centered Glucose-Insulin Data Display for the Inpatient Setting.", "doi": null, "journal": ["Studies in health technology and informatics", "Stud Health Technol Inform"]}
