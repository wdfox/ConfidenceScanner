Calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase (CASK) plays a vital role in neural development and release of neurotransmitters, and probably plays a role in the anchoring of insulin on pancreatic \u03b2 cell membrane. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF1\u03b1) is involved in \u03b2-cell dysfunction. The aim of this study was to provide some basic evidence that CASK could be involved in glucotoxicity-induced insulin secretion dysfunction mediated by HIF1\u03b1 in INS-1E cells. CASK overexpression plasmid, HIF1\u03b1 agonist (CoCl2), and HIF1\u03b1 selective inhibitor (KC7F2) were used. The results showed that chronic stimulation with high glucose could induce insulin secretion dysfunction in INS-1E \u03b2 cells. Overexpression of CASK partially reversed the effects of high glucose on insulin secretion. CoCl2 reduced the expression of CASK, but KC7F2 reversed the glucotoxicity-induced CASK level reduction. These results suggest that glucotoxicity-induced insulin secretion defects in INS-1E cells could be mediated by HIF1\u03b1 via the down-regulation of CASK.", "id": "29293883", "date": "2017-12-26", "title": "Down-regulation of CASK in glucotoxicity-induced insulin dysfunction in pancreatic \u03b2 cells.", "doi": "10.1093/abbs/gmx139", "journal": ["Acta biochimica et biophysica Sinica", "Acta Biochim.
