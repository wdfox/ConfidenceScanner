Referring to current successful cases, we designed a framework for the interoperability and integration of medical data in compliance with both archetype and reference information model specification. The clinical data model (CDM) was designed on the basis of OpenEHR archetypes and self-made patient generated health data (PGHD). Integrating healthcare enterprise (IHE) protocol was taken into integrating different modality data. After terminology mapping, the personal health record could be transferred and shared in different clinical information vendors complying with HL7 standards. Many fragment data such as blood glucose and gene data were also integrated to system. Those patients suspected of higher risk of diabetic retinopathy (DR) were grouped as case and other patients could be filtered as control cohort. Furthermore, the framework could be further developed for precision medicine.", "id": "29295095", "date": null, "title": "iT2DM Project: A Framework for Secondary Use of EHR Data for High-Throughput Phenotyping in Diabetes.", "doi": null, "journal": ["Studies in health technology and informatics", "Stud Health Technol Inform"]}
