Study intervention was incorporated into the health education curriculum at a public charter school and implemented over 11\u00a0weeks. Study sample included primarily African-American and Hispanic adolescents (N\u00a0=\u00a0101) aged 13-18 attending the public charter school in a New Jersey urban community.Instrumentation included valid, reliable measures of self-efficacy for healthy eating, physical activity, food knowledge, and healthy food choices. Participants' pretest/posttest waist circumference and body mass index (BMI) were collected.Outcomes revealed significant (p\u00a0<\u00a0.001) increase in participants' food knowledge, self-efficacy for choosing healthy foods and performing physical activity, healthy food choices, and amount of weekly aerobic exercise. Reductions in BMI and waist circumference were statistically significant (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05).A modified DPP adapted for adolescents' learning needs lowered risk for T2DM. Implications for clinical practice, education, and research are posed.", "id": "29285793", "date": "2017-12-29", "title": "Application of a modified diabetes prevention program with adolescents.", "doi": "10.1111/phn.12379", "journal": ["Public health nursing (Boston, Mass.)", "Public Health Nurs"]}
