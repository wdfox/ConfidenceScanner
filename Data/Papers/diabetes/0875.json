Many factors affecting the healing of BP have been identified; 1 factor commonly considered relevant is the presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Our aim was to investigate the effects of diabetes on the healing of BP.Sixty patients with BP were followed up for 1 to 3 years and were divided into 2 groups, those with and those without type 2 diabetes. All were prescribed prednisone (initially 1\u2009mg/kg per day, with a tapered dose reduction) and acyclovir (200\u2009mg orally every 4 h, 5 times daily, for 5 days). Their recovery times were compared.The healing times of the patients with and without diabetes did not differ.Diabetes does not affect the severity, recovery rate from or healing of BP.", "id": "29284561", "date": "2017-12-25", "title": "Does Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Affect the Healing of Bell's Palsy in Adults?", "doi": "10.1016/j.jcjd.2017.10.055", "journal": ["Canadian journal of diabetes", "Can J Diabetes"]}
