Patients were required to have been diagnosed with pDPN or score\u2009\u2265\u20093 on ID Pain validated screening tool. The survey elicited information on pDPN symptoms and interactions with healthcare providers (HCPs), and included the Brief Pain Inventory and pain-specific Work Productivity and Assessment Questionnaire (WPAI:SHP).Respondents included 823 Caucasians, 525 African-Americans, and 537 Hispanics; approximately half of African-Americans and Hispanics were <40\u00a0years of age, vs 12% of Caucasians. Pain was less likely to be rated moderate or severe by African-Americans (65%) and Hispanics (49%) relative to Caucasians (87%; p\u2009<\u20090.05). African-Americans and Hispanics were less likely than Caucasians to report experiencing specific pDPN sensory symptoms. Significantly fewer African-Americans and Hispanics reported receiving a pDPN diagnosis relative to Caucasians (p\u2009<\u20090.05), and higher proportions of African-Americans and Hispanics reported difficulty communicating with their HCP (p\u2009<\u20090.05). WPAI:SHP activity impairment was lower in Hispanics (43%) relative to African-Americans (53%) and Caucasian (56%; p\u2009<\u20090.05).Multicultural patients reported differences in pDPN symptoms and pain relative to Caucasians, and fewer received a pDPN diagnosis. While further evaluation is needed to understand these differences, these data suggest a need to broaden pDPN educational initiatives to improve patient-HCP dialogue and encourage discussion of pDPN symptoms and their impact in a multicultural setting.", "id": "29299335", "date": "2017-12-28", "title": "Perspectives on the impact of painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy in a multicultural population.", "doi": "10.1186/s40842-017-0051-2", "journal": ["Clinical diabetes and endocrinology", "Clin Diabetes Endocrinol"]}
