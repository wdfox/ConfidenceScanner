This article analyzes the first prefilled HUP, the Humalog Junior KwikPen, in the context of other, similar devices and the developing landscape of smart insulin pens. The Junior KwikPen's suitability for pediatric patients is assessed in reference to a recent study surveying its accuracy and usability under varying conditions intended to simulate real-world use.", "id": "29281890", "date": "2017-12-01", "title": "Analysis of \"Dose Accuracy, Injection Force, and Usability Assessment of a New Half-Unit, Prefilled Insulin Pen\".", "doi": "10.1177/1932296817747621", "journal": ["Journal of diabetes science and technology", "J Diabetes Sci Technol"]}
