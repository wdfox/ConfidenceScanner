He had significant hallux valgus deformity, multiple episodes of healing and breakdown, and eventual transformation to verrucous carcinoma (VC). This case report highlights the malignant transformation of a site of previous DFU to VC, which, to the best of the authors' knowledge, has not yet been described in the literature. There has been little research performed that examines VC in the diabetic population. This case report also highlights the importance of clinical suspicion for malignant transformation as well as the use of subsequent biopsy when necessary.", "id": "29324428", "date": null, "title": "Malignant Transformation of a Site of Prior Diabetic Foot Ulceration to Verrucous Carcinoma: A Case Report.", "doi": null, "journal": ["Wounds : a compendium of clinical research and practice", "Wounds"]}
