Age-adjusted prevalence ratios at different schooling levels were calculated using Poisson regression.Tobacco use, alcohol abuse and the consumption of meat with visible fat were more frequent among men, while the medical diagnosis of diseases such as diabetes, high blood pressure and dyslipidaemia was more frequent among women. In both genders, the highest level of education was associated with a lower prevalence of tobacco use, excessive consumption of soft drinks and excessive TV time, as well as increased alcohol abuse.The results of this study represent a challenge for public health policies in Brazil, since sociodemographic inequalities reflect differences in the prevalence of risk factors and, consequently, in the prevalence of chronic noncommunicable diseases.", "id": "29300982", "date": "2017-12-29", "title": "Gender and schooling inequalities in risk and protective factors for chronic diseases among Brazilian adults.", "doi": "10.1093/pubmed/fdx183", "journal": ["Journal of public health (Oxford, England)", "J Public Health (Oxf)"]}
