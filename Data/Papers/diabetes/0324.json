A chart review was conducted of patients with perioperative corneal abrasion following non-ocular surgery and age-matched controls between June 2011 and November 2013. An age-stratified logistic regression model evaluated the association between corneal abrasion and potentially predisposing variables. The adjusted odds of a corneal abrasion occurring were 4.6 times greater for patients having surgery for \u2265 3 hours (p=0.001) and 3.6 times greater for patients with pre-existing ocular disease (p=0.02). Gender, diabetes status, surgical procedure or position were not found to be associated with the occurrence of a corneal abrasion. Corneal abrasions were associated with longer procedures and history of pre-existing ocular disease. No significant association between body positioning or surgical site and perioperative corneal abrasion was found. The study concludes that a longer duration of surgical procedure and pre-existing ocular disease are risk factors for perioperative corneal abrasion.", "id": "29328794", "date": null, "title": "Corneal abrasion following anaesthesia for non-ocular surgical procedures: A case-controlled study.", "doi": null, "journal": ["Journal of perioperative practice", "J Perioper Pract"]}
