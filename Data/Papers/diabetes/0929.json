However, the extent to which TCR affinity regulates the function of self-reactive Tregs is largely unknown. In this study, we used a two-TCR model to assess the role of TCR affinity in Treg function during autoimmunity. We observed that high- and low-affinity Tregs were recruited to the pancreas and contributed to protection from autoimmune diabetes. Interestingly, high-affinity cells preferentially upregulated the TCR-dependent Treg functional mediators IL-10, TIGIT, GITR, and CTLA4, whereas low-affinity cells displayed increased transcripts for Areg and Ebi3, suggesting distinct functional profiles. The results of this study suggest mechanistically distinct and potentially nonredundant roles for high- and low-affinity Tregs in controlling autoimmunity.", "id": "29282307", "date": "2017-12-27", "title": "Cutting Edge: Low-Affinity TCRs Support Regulatory T Cell Function in Autoimmunity.", "doi": "10.4049/jimmunol.1700156", "journal": ["Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)", "J.
