We identified the yeast-like organism to be Candida glabrata and found that this fungus was highly resistant to azole antifungal drugs. To understand the mechanism of azole resistance in this isolate, the sequences and expression levels of the genes involved in drug resistance were analyzed. The results of our analysis showed that increased drug efflux, mediated by overexpression of ATP transporter genes CDR1 and PDH1, is the main cause of azole resistance of the C. glabrata isolated here.", "id": "29371812", "date": "2017-12-31", "title": "Azole Resistance Caused by Increased Drug Efflux in Candida glabrata Isolated from the Urinary Tract of a Dog with Diabetes Mellitus.", "doi": "10.5941/MYCO.2017.45.4.426", "journal": ["Mycobiology", "Mycobiology"]}
