Change in glycated hemoglobin (A1C) levels over time was measured against the percentage of patient visits (PPVs) accompanied by a glucose meter and/or diary.Increasing PPVs were significantly associated with decline in A1C levels in females. Every 10% increase in PPVs resulted in a 0.18% decrease in A1C levels (p<0.0001). To achieve a clinically important decrease of 1% in A1C levels, a 56% increase in PPVs was required. Increased A1C levels were significantly associated with higher baseline A1C levels (p<0.001) and increased hospital days for foot complications (p<0.0052).Regular, face-to-face contact with a DNE in an MDF clinic has a positive impact on glycemic control in females.", "id": "29284562", "date": "2017-12-25", "title": "Optimizing Glycemic Control in Adults With Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes Attending a Multidisciplinary Foot Clinic.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jcjd.2017.10.058", "journal": ["Canadian journal of diabetes", "Can J Diabetes"]}
