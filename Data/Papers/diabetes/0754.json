However, macroencapsulation entails a problem with oxygen supply to the encapsulated cells. The \u03b2Air device solves this with an incorporated refillable oxygen tank. This phase 1 study evaluated the safety and efficacy of implanting the \u03b2Air device containing allogeneic human pancreatic islets to patients with type 1 diabetes. Four patients were transplanted with 1-2 \u03b2Air devices, each containing 155000-180000 IEQ (i.e. 1800-4600 IEQ per kg body weight), and monitored for 3-6 months, followed by the recovery of devices. Implantation of the \u03b2Air device was safe and successfully prevented immunization and rejection of the transplanted tissue. However, although beta cells survived in the device, only minute levels of circulating C-peptide were observed with no impact on metabolic control. Fibrotic tissue with immune cells was formed in capsule surroundings. Recovered devices displayed a blunted glucose-stimulated insulin response, and amyloid formation in the endocrine tissue. We conclude that the \u03b2Air device is safe and can support survival of allogeneic islets for several months, although the function of the transplanted cells was limited.
