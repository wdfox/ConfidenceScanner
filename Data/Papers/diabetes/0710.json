The aim of this study is to evaluate clinical factors to predict increased postoperative serum myoglobin levels following bariatric surgery.Serum myoglobin levels were studied in 281obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery in the University Hospital Leipzig, Germany between May 2012 and June 2015. A linear regression model using stepwise model selection and hence a nomogram for postoperative serum myoglobin levels after bariatric surgery with statistically significant covariates were derived and verified using bootstrap sampling.Increased serum myoglobin levels were detected firstly 4\u00a0h directly after bariatric surgery (median 124\u00a0ng/ml, range 25-22,064\u00a0ng/ml). On multivariable analysis, age, body mass index (BMI), presence of Diabetes Mellitus (DM) type II, duration of bariatric surgery, and preoperative serum myoglobin levels were significant predictors for increased serum myoglobin levels postoperatively. Furthermore, the patients were classified according to bariatric surgery duration and BMI into groups. Patients with BMI \u2265\u200960\u00a0kg/m2 and operating time (OP-Time) \u2265\u2009160\u00a0min demonstrated the highest postoperative serum myoglobin levels (32% with values \u2265\u20093000\u00a0ng/ml) and had significantly higher postoperative morbidity including rhabdomyolysis, AKI, and compartment syndrome.We provide a clinical nomogram for prediction of serum myoglobin levels following bariatric surgery, which may improve clinicians' abilities to stratify bariatric patients in risk of developing rhabdomyolysis during the postoperative course, but requires further validation.", "id": "29290012", "date": "2017-12-30", "title": "A Nomogram Based on Clinical Factors to Predict the Serum Myoglobin Levels Following Bariatric Surgery.", "doi": "10.1007/s11695-017-3078-7", "journal": ["Obesity surgery", "Obes Surg"]}
