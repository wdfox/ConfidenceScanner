ZnT8A, GADA, and IA-2A were analyzed in all samples.Among those individuals included, 142 (28%) were ZnT8A-positive. A total of 228/516 suffered from T1D, of whom 110 (48%) were ZnT8A-positive and 166 (73%) GADA and/or IA-2A positive. When adding ZnT8A to GADA/IA-2A, 184 (81%) patients were positive for \u22651 Ab. Regarding the 122 patients at T1D onset, 75 (61%) were positive for ZnT8A and the proportion of patients with T1D with \u22651 Ab reached 89%. The highest prevalence of ZnT8A was observed in children aged 6-10years. Fourteen of the 124 patients positive for ZnT8A with a known clinical diagnosis suffered from a disease other than T1D.ZnT8A should be included in routine evaluation at diabetes onset and is a valuable biological marker to classify newly-diagnosed diabetics. The predictive value in our high-risk subjects has to be confirmed.", "id": "29288641", "date": "2017-12-28", "title": "Screening of ZnT8 autoantibodies in the diagnosis of autoimmune diabetes in a large French cohort.", "doi": "10.1016/j.cca.2017.12.043", "journal": ["Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry", "Clin.
