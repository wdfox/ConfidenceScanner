The purpose of the present study was to systematically review and quantitatively summarise results from randomised controlled trials (RCT) examining effects of 100\u00a0% fruit juice on glucose-insulin homeostasis. Eligible studies were identified from a systematic review of PubMed and EMBASE and hand searches of reference lists from reviews and relevant papers. Using data from eighteen RCT, meta-analyses evaluated the mean difference in fasting blood glucose (sixteen studies), fasting blood insulin (eleven studies), the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR; seven studies) and glycosylated Hb (HbA1c; three studies) between the 100\u00a0% fruit juice intervention and control groups using a random-effects model. Compared with the control group, 100\u00a0% fruit juice had no significant effect on fasting blood glucose (-0\u00b713 (95\u00a0% CI -0\u00b728, 0\u00b701)\u00a0mmol/l; P\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b707), fasting blood insulin (-0\u00b724 (95\u00a0% CI -3\u00b754, 3\u00b705)\u00a0pmol/l; P\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b789), HOMA-IR (-0\u00b722 (95\u00a0% CI -0\u00b750, 0\u00b706); P\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b713) or HbA1c (-0\u00b7001 (95\u00a0% CI -0\u00b738, 0\u00b738) %; P\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b728). Results from stratified analyses and univariate meta-regressions also largely showed no significant associations between 100\u00a0% fruit juice and the measures of glucose control. Overall, findings from this meta-analysis of RCT suggest a neutral effect of 100\u00a0% fruit juice on glycaemic control. These findings are consistent with findings from some observational studies suggesting that consumption of 100\u00a0% fruit juice is not associated with increased risk of diabetes.", "id": "29299307", "date": "2017-12-15", "title": "100\u00a0% Fruit juice and measures of glucose control and insulin sensitivity: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.", "doi": "10.1017/jns.2017.63", "journal": ["Journal of nutritional science", "J Nutr Sci"]}
