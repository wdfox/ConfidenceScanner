Gemigliptin is a new member of this family of drugs, and studies have revealed certain advantages of gemigliptin use compared to its previous congeners. Besides, this drug has also been studied for the treatment of T2DM as monotherapy, in combination with metformin or other oral antidiabetic drugs and in T2DM with moderate-to-severe renal failure. In this review, we explore the published data highlighting the pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of gemigliptin along with its recommendations for use in patients with T2DM.", "id": "29285456", "date": null, "title": "Gemigliptin: Newer Promising Gliptin for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.", "doi": "10.4103/ijem.IJEM_20_17", "journal": ["Indian journal of endocrinology and metabolism", "Indian J Endocrinol Metab"]}
