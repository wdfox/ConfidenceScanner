We compare the counterfactual drug effectiveness in lowering glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels and effect on body mass index (BMI) of four diabetes second-line drug classes using electronic health records.Retrospective analysis of electronic health records of US-based patients in the Explorys database using causal inference methodology to adjust for patient censoring and confounders.Our cohort consisted of more than 40\u2009000 patients with type 2 diabetes, prescribed metformin along with a drug out of four second-line drug classes-sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists-during the years 2000-2015. Roughly, 17\u2009000 of these patients were followed for 12 months after being prescribed a second-line drug.HbA1c and BMI of these patients after 6 and 12 months following treatment.We demonstrate that all four drug classes reduce HbA1c levels, but the effect of sulfonylureas after 6 and 12 months of treatment is less pronounced compared with other classes. We also estimate that DPP-4 inhibitors decrease body weight significantly more than sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones.Our results are in line with current knowledge on second-line drug effectiveness and effect on BMI. They demonstrate that causal inference from electronic health records is an effective way for conducting multitreatment causal inference studies.", "id": "29299328", "date": "2017-11-30", "title": "Estimating the effects of second-line therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus: retrospective cohort study.", "doi": "10.1136/bmjdrc-2017-000435", "journal": ["BMJ open diabetes research & care", "BMJ Open Diabetes Res Care"]}
