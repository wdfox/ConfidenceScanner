Cinnamon has been reported to reduce fructose-induced oxidative stress in the rat liver. However, the mechanism by which cinnamon protects the liver in a high-saccharide environment remains to be investigated. HepG2 cells were cultured with 30 mM D-ribose to mimic the high-oxidative-stress environment, typical of a liver in a diabetic patient. Three different chemical types of C. osmophloeum ethanol extracts (CEEs) were added in HepG2 culture media and the administration of all three CEEs protected HepG2 cells from D-ribose damage and increased cell survival by approximately 20 percent. Exclusively, the transcript variant 1 of the ghrelin gene, but not variant 3, was 2-3 times induced by the addition of these CEEs. Moreover, the mRNAs of ghrelin processing enzyme, furin, and mboat4 were detected in HepG2 cells. The ghrelin hormones in the culture media were increased 4-9 times by the addition of CEEs. The protective effects of ghrelin on HepG2 cells in D-ribose environment were further confirmed by recombinant ghrelin transfection. We conclude that the CEEs induce ghrelin gene expression and protect HepG2 cells from D-ribose-induced oxidative damage through ghrelin signalling.", "id": "29358557", "date": null, "title": "Cinnamomum osmophloeum Kanehira ethanol extracts prevents human liver-derived HepG2 cell death from oxidation stress by induction of ghrelin gene expression.", "doi": null, "journal": ["Journal of biosciences", "J.
