However, rimonabant adverse effects include depression, anxiety, nausea, and dizziness which are apparently due to the blockade of central CB1 receptors. In mice with a high-calorie diet, we defined that the blockade of peripheral CB1 receptors prevents obesity, steatosis of the liver, improves lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. Experimental studies suggest that peripheral CB2 receptor agonists have antiatherogenic effect. To validate the expediency of clinical research of CB2 receptor agonists in patients with atherosclerosis the comparative analysis of antiatherogenic properties of cannabinoids should be performed. In addition, experiments are needed on the combination use of cannabinoids with well-known antiatherogenic agents, such as statins.", "id": "29308855", "date": null, "title": "Prospects for the Use of Cannabinoid Receptor Ligands for the Treatment of Metabolic Syndrome and Atherosclerosis: Analysis of Experimental and Clinical Data.", "doi": null, "journal": ["Vestnik Rossiiskoi akademii meditsinskikh nauk", "Vestn.
