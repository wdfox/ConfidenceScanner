Since the association between FGF21 and diabetic retinopathy is not clear, this study was conducted to investigate this relationship. In this cross-sectional study, 61 subjects (14 healthy controls, 22 diabetic patients without retinopathy, and 25 patients with diabetic retinopathy) were evaluated. All patients in the study were examined for the presence of diabetic retinopathy. Various clinical and biochemical parameters including FGF21 were evaluated and analyzed and compared between the study groups. Serum levels of FGF21 showed a significant difference between the three groups (P=0.003) but the difference between diabetic patients with and without retinopathy was not significant (P=0.122). Regression model was used to evaluate the role of FGF21 in predicting diabetic retinopathy. In the multivariate logistic regression model after adjustment of systolic blood pressure and fasting blood glucose, the level of FGF21 was not associated with diabetic retinopathy. In the multivariate model, only fasting blood glucose was associated with diabetic retinopathy (P=0.009). According to the results of this study, serum levels of FGF21 in diabetic patients was higher than the control group but these raised levels could not predict the presence of diabetic retinopathy.", "id": "29285020", "date": "2017-11-22", "title": "The relationship between serum levels of fibroblast growth factor 21 and diabetic retinopathy.", "doi": "10.17179/excli2017-672", "journal": ["EXCLI journal", "EXCLI J"]}
