The extent of these barriers varies by demographics and different socioeconomic circumstances that people find themselves in. The purpose of this paper is to present and discuss a new framework to understand, disentangle and tackle these barriers so that improvements in the effectiveness of diabetes interventions for BAME communities can be achieved.The main mediators of lifestyle behavioural change are gender, generation, geography, genes, God/religion, and gaps in knowledge and economic resources. Dietary and cultural practices of these individuals significantly vary according to gender, generation, geographical origin and religion. Recognition of these factors is essential in increasing knowledge of healthy eating, engagement in physical activity and utilisation of healthcare services. Use of the six G's framework alongside a community centred approach is crucial in developing and implementing culturally sensitive interventions for diabetes prevention and management in BAME communities. This could improve their health outcomes and overall wellbeing.", "id": "29282119", "date": "2017-12-28", "title": "Improving prevention, monitoring and management of diabetes among ethnic minorities: contextualizing the six G's approach.", "doi": "10.1186/s13104-017-3104-9", "journal": ["BMC research notes", "BMC Res Notes"]}
