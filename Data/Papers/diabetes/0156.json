Adolescents with T1DM also develop early changes in blood pressure, cardiovascular structure and function. Our aims were to define the relationships between hyperfiltration, ACR, and 24-Hr ambulatory blood pressure over time in adolescents with T1DM.Normotensive, normoalbuminuric adolescents (n=98) with T1DM underwent baseline and 2-year 24-Hr ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) estimated by cystatin C (Larsson equation) and ACR measurements. Linear regression models adjusted for diabetes duration, sex, and HbA1c were used to determine associations.Hyperfiltration (eGFR {greater than or equal to} 133 ml/min) was present in 31% at baseline and 21% at 2-year follow-up. Hyperfiltration was associated with greater odds of rapid GFR decline (>3ml/min/year) [OR: 5.33, 95% CI 1.87-15.17, p=0.002] over 2 years. Natural log of ACR at baseline was associated with greater odds of hyperfiltration (OR: 1.71, 95% CI 1.00-2.92, p=0.049) and 2-year follow-up (OR: 2.14, 95% CI 1.09-4.19, p=0.03). One SD increase in eGFR, but not ln ACR, at 2-year follow-up conferred greater odds of night-time non-dipping pattern (OR: 1.96, 95% CI 1.06-3.63, p=0.03).Hyperfiltration was prevalent at baseline and at 2-year follow-up, predicted rapid decline in GFR and was related to ACR. Elevated GFR at 2-year follow-up was associated with night-time non-dipping pattern. More work is needed to better understand early relationships between renal and systemic hemodynamic changes in adolescents with T1DM to reduce future cardiorenal complications.", "id": "29357443", "date": "2017-12-13", "title": "Hyperfiltration, urinary albumin excretion, and ambulatory blood pressure in adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus.", "doi": "10.1152/ajprenal.00400.2017", "journal": ["American journal of physiology.
