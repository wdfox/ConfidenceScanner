Methods: From June 1(st), 2000 to May 31(st), 2017, 65 621 women delivered in Peking University First Hospital. Clinical data of 105 cases of IUFD (including 82 singleton pregnancies and 23 twin pregnancies) during the 17 years were analyzed retrospectively. Results: (1) In singleton pregnancies, the leading cause of IUFD was maternal complications, including severe pre-eclampsia (36/82, 43.9%) and diabetes mellitus (6/82, 7.3%). The second reason was umbilical cord factors (13/82, 15.9%), including over-screwed umbilical cord, cord entanglement, true knot of cord. 54 women of singleton pregnancy (65.9%, 54/82) felt abnormal fetal movements (decreased or disappeared). (2) In twin pregnancies, the leading cause was complications of monochorionic twins (12/23, 52.2%). Seven woman of twin pregnancy (65.9%, 54/82) felt abnormal fetal movements. Conclusions: To reduce the occurrence of IUFD, the pregnancy complications should be managed in time and properly. Monochorionic twins should be determined as early as possible. More attention should be paid toabnormal fetal movement and the application of ultrasound.\u76ee\u7684\uff1a \u63a2\u8ba8\u8fd117\u5e74\u95f4\u80ce\u6b7b\u5bab\u5185\u7684\u8bf1\u56e0\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u9884\u9632\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002 \u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a 2000\u5e746\u67081\u65e5\u81f32017\u5e745\u670831\u65e5\u5317\u4eac\u5927\u5b66\u7b2c\u4e00\u533b\u9662\u7684\u603b\u5206\u5a29\u91cf\u4e3a65 621\u4f8b\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u80ce\u6b7b\u5bab\u5185\u7684\u5b55\u5987105\u4f8b\uff1b105\u4f8b\u80ce\u6b7b\u5bab\u5185\u7684\u5b55\u5987\u4e2d\uff0c\u5355\u80ce\u598a\u5a20\u800582\u4f8b\uff0c\u53cc\u80ce\u598a\u5a20\u800523\u4f8b\u3002\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u80ce\u6b7b\u5bab\u5185\u5b55\u5987\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u8d44\u6599\u8fdb\u884c\u56de\u987e\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002 \u7ed3\u679c\uff1a \uff081\uff09\u5355\u80ce\u598a\u5a20\u5b55\u5987\uff1a\u5355\u80ce\u598a\u5a20\u5b55\u5987\u80ce\u6b7b\u5bab\u5185\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u8bf1\u56e0\u4e3a\u6bcd\u4f53\u5e76\u53d1\u75c7\u6216\u5408\u5e76\u75c7\uff0851.2%\uff0c42/82\uff09\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u91cd\u5ea6\u5b50\u75eb\u524d\u671f\u8005\u536039.0%\uff0832/82\uff09\uff0c\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u5408\u5e76\u598a\u5a20\u8005\u53607.3%\uff086/82\uff09\uff1b\u5176\u6b21\u4e3a\u8110\u5e26\u56e0\u7d20\uff0815.9%\uff0c13/82\uff09\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8110\u5e26\u8fc7\u5ea6\u87ba\u65cb\u3001\u8110\u5e26\u7f20\u7ed5\u53ca\u8110\u5e26\u771f\u7ed3\u7b49\u3002\u5355\u80ce\u598a\u5a20\u5b55\u5987\u4e2d\u81ea\u611f\u80ce\u52a8\u5f02\u5e38\uff08\u51cf\u5c11\u6216\u6d88\u5931\uff09\u8005\u517154\u4f8b\uff0865.9%\uff0c54/82\uff09\u3002\uff082\uff09\u53cc\u80ce\u598a\u5a20\u5b55\u5987\uff1a\u53cc\u80ce\u598a\u5a20\u5b55\u5987\u80ce\u6b7b\u5bab\u5185\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u8bf1\u56e0\u4e3a\u5355\u7ed2\u6bdb\u819c\u53cc\u80ce\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u5e76\u53d1\u75c7\uff0c\u536052.2%\uff0812/23\uff09\u3002\u53cc\u80ce\u598a\u5a20\u5b55\u5987\u4e2d\u81ea\u611f\u80ce\u52a8\u5f02\u5e38\u8005\u51717\u4f8b\uff0830.4%\uff0c7/23\uff09\u3002 \u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a \u5bf9\u5b55\u671f\u5408\u5e76\u75c7\u5e94\u53ca\u65e9\u53d1\u73b0\u3001\u79ef\u6781\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u5c3d\u65e9\u786e\u5b9a\u53cc\u80ce\u598a\u5a20\u7684\u7ed2\u6bdb\u819c\u6027\uff0c\u91cd\u89c6\u5b55\u5987\u80ce\u52a8\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u4e3b\u8bc9\uff0c\u52a0\u5f3a\u5b55\u671f\u4e2a\u4f53\u5316\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u80ce\u6b7b\u5bab\u5185\u7684\u53d1\u751f\u3002.", "id": "29325265", "date": null, "title": "[Clinical analysis of 105 intrauterine fetal deaths in 17 years].", "doi": null, "journal": ["Zhonghua fu chan ke za zhi", "Zhonghua Fu Chan Ke Za Zhi"]}
