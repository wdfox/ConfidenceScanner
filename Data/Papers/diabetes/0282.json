The present study evaluated whether the extract of cupua\u00e7u (EC), an antioxidant compound rich in polyphenols and theograndins, when administered at a dose that can be reasonably obtained through daily consumption, could delay the onset of diabetic complications in the kidney.Mouse immortalized mesangial cells (MiMC) were placed in medium normal glucose (NG) or high glucose (HG), with or without EC (500, 100, 50 or 10\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) during 24, 48 or 72\u00a0h for analysis of viability, proliferation, nitric oxide (NO) levels and reactive oxygen species or nitrogen (ROS/RNS). Male, adult Wistar rats were distributed in 4 groups: control (CTL) and diabetic (DM) who received water; CTLEC and DMEC who received 1\u00a0mL/day of EC (1\u00a0g/mL), via gavage for 8 consecutive weeks. After, metabolic profile and renal function were evaluated and, kidneys were collected for analysis of NO, ROS, 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), IL-6, IL-10, TNF-\u03b1 and NF-\u03baB p65.The MiMC showed normal viability in all groups, demonstrating that EC had no cytotoxic effect at doses on 24, 48 or 72\u00a0h. MiMC under HG presented significant increase in proliferation, NO and ROS vs. NG; these parameters were significantly reduced after 72\u00a0h of EC treatment (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). DMEC showed a significant reduction of feed intake, ROS and NO, 3-NT, IL-6 and eNOS vs. DM (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Supplementation with EC at a dose consumed daily could improve control of nitrosative stress, combined with reduction of inflammatory factors, suggesting the importance of bioactive compounds as non-pharmacological adjuvant therapy to delay kidney complications in diabetic patients.", "id": "29336891", "date": "2017-12-26", "title": "Cupua\u00e7u extract reduces nitrosative stress and modulates inflammatory mediators in the kidneys of experimental diabetes.", "doi": "10.1016/j.clnu.2017.12.016", "journal": ["Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)", "Clin Nutr"]}
