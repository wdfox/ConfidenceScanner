Dietary intake was assessed by a quantitative food frequency questionnaire and eating patterns identified by cluster analysis. The therapeutic targets were as follows: blood pressure, <140/90 mm Hg; BMI, <25 kg/m2 (<27 kg/m2 for elderly); waist circumference, <94 cm for men and <80 cm for women; fasting plasma glucose, <130 mg/dL; HbA1c, <7%; triglycerides, <150 mg/dL; HDL-cholesterol, >40 mg/dL for men and >50 mg/dL for women; LDL-cholesterol, <100 mg/dL.One hundred ninety seven patients were studied. We identified two eating patterns: \"unhealthy\" (n = 100)-high consumption of refined carbohydrates, ultra-processed foods, sweets and desserts (P < 0.05); and \"healthy\" (n = 97)-high intake of whole carbohydrates, dairy, white meat, fish, fruits and vegetables (P < 0.05). The healthy group more frequently achieved therapeutic targets for fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, and LDL-cholesterol than the unhealthy group. Poisson regression confirmed the association of healthy eating pattern with attaining the therapeutic target for fasting plasma glucose [PR, 1.59 (95% CI, 1.01 to 2.34); P = 0.018], HbA1c [PR, 2.09 (95% CI, 1.17 to 3.74); P = 0.013], and LDL-cholesterol [PR, 1.37 (95% CI, 1.01 to 1.86); P = 0.042].A healthy eating pattern, including the frequent intake of whole carbohydrates, dairy, white meat, fish, fruits, and vegetables, is associated with reduced fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, and LDL cholesterol levels in patients with type 2 diabetes.", "id": "29308450", "date": "2017-11-17", "title": "Eating Patterns and Health Outcomes in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes.", "doi": "10.1210/js.2017-00349", "journal": ["Journal of the Endocrine Society", "J Endocr Soc"]}
