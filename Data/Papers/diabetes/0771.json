The main interest variable is the incidence of hypertension at three months of treatment.From January, 2011\u00a0to July, 2014, 324\u00a0patients have been included, whose 53% are men. Mean age is 62\u00b113\u00a0years old. Antecedents are: 37% of hypertension, 17% of chronic renal insufficiency, 21% of nephrectomy, 13% of diabetes. Most frequent cancers are kidney (31%), liver (23%) and breast (16%). Most used molecules are: sorafenib (30%), sunitinib (23%) and everolimus (16%). Blood pressure has been measured at the beginning of the treatment in 157\u00a0patients (48%). Among them, during the first three months of treatment, 55 (35%) present hypertension according to the oncological definition and 59 (38%) according to the classical definition; 30\u00a0patients (19%) are considered as hypertensive according to only one of the two\u00a0definitions. In multivariable analysis, variables significantly associated with hypertension are: age (OR=1.04; 95% CI 1.02-1.08; P<0.01) and antecedent of nephrectomy (OR=4.29; 95%CI 1.86-9.92; P<0.01).In this cohort, only 48% of the patients had blood pressure determination before treatment. Hypertension under angiogenesis inhibitors is probably underestimated. Age and antecedent of nephrectomy seem to be correlated with the occurrence of hypertension.", "id": "29287894", "date": "2017-12-26", "title": "[Monitoring of hypertension in patients orally treated by angiogenesis inhibitor in daily practice].", "doi": "10.1016/j.nephro.2017.04.006", "journal": ["Nephrologie & therapeutique", "Nephrol.
