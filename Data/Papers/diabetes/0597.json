The study comprised 92 type 2 diabetics divided into quartiles regarding 25(OH)D\u2083 concentration. Each group was divided into male and female subgroups. All the studied patients had their anthropometric and biochemical parameters determined. Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D\u2083 concentration was determined by HPLC, while the selected adipokines (leptin, adiponectin, resistin and visfatin) by ELISA methods. The ratio of leptin to adiponectin (L/A) was calculated for all the patients. In 85.3% of diabetics a full (<20 ng/mL) or moderate (20-30 ng/mL) vitamin D deficit was found. Irrespective of sex, plasma leptin concentration decreased across increasing quartiles of 25(OH)D\u2083 level. In women, 25(OH)D\u2083 was negatively correlated with BMI, leptin level as well as L/A ratio, and positively with adiponectin concentration. In men, 25(OH)D\u2083 was positively correlated with HDL and negatively with systolic blood pressure (SBP), leptin level and L/A ratio. Considering all the patients, there ocurred a significant negative correlation between 25(OH)D\u2083 and SBP, BMI, WHR, TG, leptin and L/A ratio and positive ones between 25(OH)D\u2083 and both adiponectin and HDL. The results of the study support the existence of the relationship among vitamin D, obesity and leptin in type 2 diabetic patients.", "id": "29295491", "date": "2017-12-23", "title": "Is There Any Relationship between Plasma 25-Hydroxyvitamin D\u2083, Adipokine Profiles and Excessive Body Weight in Type 2 Diabetic Patients?", "doi": "10.3390/ijerph15010019", "journal": ["International journal of environmental research and public health", "Int J Environ Res Public Health"]}
