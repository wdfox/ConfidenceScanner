The Atrial Fibrillation Clopidogrel Trial With Irbesartan for Prevention of Vascular Events (ACTIVE A) recruited patients with AF who were unsuitable to receive vitamin K-antagonists and were randomized to aspirin alone versus aspirin plus clopidogrel. We investigated independent predictors of all-cause mortality by multivariable Cox regression analysis and explored interactions with assigned antiplatelet therapy. Of the 7,554 patients enrolled with a mean age of 71 years, 1,687 (22%) patients died during the median follow-up of 3.7 years (annualized mortality rate 6.4%/year). Assignment to dual antiplatelet therapy had no effect on mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 0.99, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.90 to 1.1) or on vascular and nonvascular death. Independent predictors of all-cause mortality were advancing age, lower body mass index (HR 1.4\u2009<\u200925\u2009kg/m2, 95% CI 1.3 to 1.6), diabetes mellitus, Latin American ethnicity (HR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.6), previous stroke or transient ischemic attack, peripheral artery disease, increased resting heart rate (HR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.4 per 30\u2009bpm), lower diastolic blood pressure, coronary artery disease, heart failure, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, hemoglobin level of <13\u2009mg/dl, and reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate. In conclusion, in this large clinical trial cohort of patients with AF, treatment with clopidogrel plus aspirin versus aspirin monotherapy did not affect all-cause mortality, vascular death, or nonvascular death. Novel independent predictors of increased mortality included lower diastolic blood pressure and Latin American ethnicity.", "id": "29291887", "date": "2017-12-11", "title": "Predictors of Mortality in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation (from the Atrial Fibrillation Clopidogrel Trial With Irbesartan for Prevention of Vascular Events [ACTIVE A]).", "doi": "10.1016/j.amjcard.2017.11.028", "journal": ["The American journal of cardiology", "Am.
