Linear mixed models were used to analyze patterns of blood glucose monitoring in patients who had at least 28\u2009days of data stored in their blood glucose monitors.In general, the frequency of blood glucose monitoring decreased across visits, and younger children engaged in more frequent blood glucose monitoring. Blood glucose monitoring increased before the T1D clinic visits in younger children, but not in adolescents. It declined after the visit regardless of age.Members of the T1D care team need to consider that a T1D clinic visit may prompt an increase in blood glucose monitoring when making treatment changes and recommendations. Tailored interventions are needed to maintain that higher level of adherence across time.", "id": "29294062", "date": "2017-12-23", "title": "Blood Glucose Monitoring Before and After Type 1 Diabetes Clinic Visits.", "doi": "10.1093/jpepsy/jsx151", "journal": ["Journal of pediatric psychology", "J Pediatr Psychol"]}
