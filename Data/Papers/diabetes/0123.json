The mean change in fasting blood sugar (FBS) was -18.48 \u00b1 33.32 mg/dl with sitagliptin and -20.53 \u00b1 53.97 mg/dl with pioglitazone, and there were no significant difference between groups (P = 0.773). Sitagliptin caused 1.08 \u00b1 2.39 kg decrease in weight, whereas pioglitazone caused 0.27 \u00b1 2.42 kg increase in weight, with a between-group difference of 0.81 kg (P < 0.001). On the other hand, in sitagliptin group, there was greater improvement in lipid profile than pioglitazone group.Sitagliptin and Pioglitazone demonstrated similar improvements in glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients whose diabetes had been inadequately controlled with metformin. Nevertheless, sitagliptin was more effective than pioglitazone regarding lipid and body weight change.", "id": "29362626", "date": "2017-12-12", "title": "Comparative Study on Adding Pioglitazone or Sitagliptin to Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Insufficiently Controlled With Metformin.", "doi": "10.3889/oamjms.2017.193", "journal": ["Open access Macedonian journal of medical sciences", "Open Access Maced J Med Sci"]}
