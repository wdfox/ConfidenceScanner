However, the results regarding the associations between PPAR\u03b3 and GDM were conflicting among different studies. The present study aimed to determine the expression of PPAR\u03b3 in adipose and placenta from GDM women in a Chinese population and to further explore the role of PPAR\u03b3 in GDM women. The adipose and placenta tissues were isolated from GDM women and healthy pregnant women at term. The mRNA and protein expressions of PPAR\u03b3 in adipose and placenta tissues were determined by qRT-PCR and western blot, respectively. Univariate correlation analysis was used to analyze the relationship between PPAR\u03b3 expression and clinical characteristics of patients. The levels of tryglycerides and HbA1c were significantly higher, while the levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, adiponectin and insulin were significantly lower in the GDM women than that in the healthy pregnant women. The mRNA and protein expression of PPAR\u03b3 in both adipose and placenta from GDM women were significantly lower than that from healthy pregnant women. PPAR\u03b3 mRNA expression in both adipose and placenta positively correlated with LDL cholesterol and adiponectin levels, and negatively correlated with tryglycerides and glucose levels at 0 h, 1 h and 2 h of 75 g oral glucose tolerance test. In summary, our results suggest that PPAR\u03b3 may be a key modulator in the development of GDM, due to the roles of PPAR\u03b3 in glucose homeostasis and adipose tissue development and function.", "id": "29371958", "date": "2017-12-08", "title": "Gestational diabetes mellitus is associated with decreased adipose and placenta peroxisome proliferator-activator receptor \u03b3 expression in a Chinese population.", "doi": "10.18632/oncotarget.23043", "journal": ["Oncotarget", "Oncotarget"]}
