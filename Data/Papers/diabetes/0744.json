Clinical trials with global inhibitors of TGF-\u03b2 have been disappointing, suggesting that a more targeted approach is warranted. Conversion of the latent precursor to the biologically active form of TGF-\u03b2 represents a novel approach to selectively modulating TGF-\u03b2 in disease, as mechanisms employed to activate latent TGF-\u03b2 are typically cell, tissue, and/or disease specific. In this review, we will discuss the role of the matricellular protein, thrombospondin 1 (TSP-1), in regulation of latent TGF-\u03b2 activation and the use of an antagonist of TSP-1 mediated TGF-\u03b2 activation in a number of diverse fibrotic diseases. In particular, we will discuss the TSP-1/TGF-\u03b2 pathway in fibrotic complications of diabetes, liver fibrosis, and in multiple myeloma. We will also discuss emerging evidence for a role for TSP-1 in arterial remodeling, biomechanical modulation of TGF-\u03b2 activity, and in immune dysfunction. As TSP-1 expression is upregulated by factors induced in fibrotic disease, targeting the TSP-1/TGF-\u03b2 pathway potentially represents a more selective approach to controlling TGF-\u03b2 activity in disease.", "id": "29288716", "date": "2017-12-27", "title": "Thrombospondin-1 regulation of latent TGF-\u03b2 activation: A therapeutic target for fibrotic disease.", "doi": "10.1016/j.matbio.2017.12.009", "journal": ["Matrix biology : journal of the International Society for Matrix Biology", "Matrix Biol."]}
