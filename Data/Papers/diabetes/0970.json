An electrical bioimpedance, blood pressure, dietary intake, exercise and biochemical analyses were recorded.Two hundred and seventeen subjects (94.8%) had genotype GG and 12 GA (5.2%) (genotype AA was not detected). Weight (delta:\u00a014.4 \u00b1 2.1 kg, p = 0.01), body mass index (delta: 2.2 \u00b1 1.1 kg/m2, p = 0.01), fat mass (delta: 11.2 \u00b1 3.1 kg, p = 0.02), waist circumference (delta: 3.9 \u00b1 2.0 cm, p = 0.02), waist to hip ratio (delta: 0.04 \u00b1 0.02 cm; p = 0.01), tryglicerides (delta: 48.6 \u00b1 9.1 mg / dl, p = 0.03) and leptin levels (delta: 58.6 \u00b1 15.9 mg/dl, p = 0.02) were higher in A allele carriers than non A allele carriers. Levels of HDL-cholesterol were lower in A allele carriers than non-carriers (delta: 5.6 \u00b1 1.1 mg/dl, p = 0.03). In regression analysis, HDl cholesterol, weight and fat mass remained in the model with the SNP.Our results show an association of this CETP variant at position +82 on HDL cholesterol, levels and adiposity parameters in obese subjects with diabetes mellitus type 2.", "id": "29280647", "date": "2017-11-14", "title": "[Relation of variant rs180077 of gen cholesterol ester transfer protein variant, with fat mass, HDL-cholesterol in obese subjects with diabetes mellitus type 2].", "doi": null, "journal": ["Nutricion hospitalaria", "Nutr Hosp"]}
