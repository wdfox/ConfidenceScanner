In group A, the patients only met the previous PTG criteria for a GDM diagnosis, i.e., those with a blood glucose level of 140-152\u2009mg/dl 2 hours after administration, a fasting glucose level <92\u2009mg/dl, and a blood glucose level <180\u2009mg/dl 1 hour after administration. Group B included patients complying with both the previous and current PTG criteria for a GDM diagnosis. Group C included patients who only met the current PTG criteria for a GDM diagnosis, i.e., those with a fasting blood glucose level of 92-99\u2009mg/dl, a blood glucose level <180\u2009mg/dl 1 hour and <140\u2009mg/dl 2\u00a0hours after administration, respectively.Women from group C were characterized by the highest fasting glycaemia in the first trimester of pregnancy (93.0\u2009mg/dL vs. 88.0\u2009mg/dL vs. 83.5\u2009mg/dL, p=0.012) and during the OGTT (p=0.001). Gestational diabetes was diagnosed significantly earlier in patients from group C (23 vs. 26 vs. 26 weeks, p=0.005). The patients from group A significantly less frequently required insulin therapy for proper glycemic control (p=0.035). Women from group A were characterized by lower pre-pregnancy BMI (p=0.001).Current PTG criteria for diagnosing GDM according to the IADPSG allow for identification of women who often require insulin therapy to achieve proper glycemic control.", "id": "29298286", "date": null, "title": "New criteria for gestational diabetes mellitus - do they impact the outcome?", "doi": null, "journal": ["Neuro endocrinology letters", "Neuro Endocrinol.
