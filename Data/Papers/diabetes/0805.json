Test-retest reliability was conducted to measure stability. Criterion and convergent validity of the adapted questionnaire were assessed using 2-hr 75\u00a0g oral glucose tolerance tests and the Finnish Diabetes Risk Scores, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity were evaluated to establish its predictive validity.The test-retest reliability was 0.988. Adequate validity of the adapted questionnaire was demonstrated by positive correlations found between the scores and 2-hr 75\u00a0g oral glucose tolerance tests (r\u00a0=\u00a0.343, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001) and with the Finnish Diabetes Risk Scores (r\u00a0=\u00a0.738, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001). The area under receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.705 (95% CI .632, .778), demonstrating moderate diagnostic value at a cutoff score of 30. The sensitivity was 73%, with a positive predictive value of 57% and negative predictive value of 78%.Our results provided evidence supporting the translation consistency, content validity, convergent validity, criterion validity, sensitivity, and specificity of the translated Canadian Diabetes Risk Assessment Questionnaire with minor modifications.
