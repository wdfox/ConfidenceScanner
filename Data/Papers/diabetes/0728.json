Residents were treated with linagliptin 5\u00a0mg/d (n\u00a0= 67) or glargine at a starting dose of 0.1 U/kg/d (n\u00a0= 73). Both groups received supplemental rapid-acting insulin before meals for BG\u00a0>\u00a0200\u00a0mg/dL.Primary outcome was mean difference in daily BG between groups. Main secondary endpoints included differences in frequency of hypoglycemia, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), complications, emergency department visits, and hospital transfers.Treatment with linagliptin resulted in no significant differences in mean daily BG (146\u00a0\u00b1 34\u00a0mg/dL vs. 157\u00a0\u00b1 36\u00a0mg/dL, P\u00a0= .07) compared to glargine. Linagliptin treatment resulted in fewer mild hypoglycemic events <70\u00a0mg/dL (3% vs. 37%, P\u00a0<\u00a0.001), but there were no differences in BG\u00a0<\u00a054\u00a0mg/dL (P\u00a0= .06) or <40\u00a0mg/dL (P\u00a0= .05) compared to glargine. There were no significant between-group differences in HbA1c, length of stay, complications, emergency department visits, or hospitalizations.Treatment with linagliptin resulted in noninferior glycemic control and in significantly lower risk of hypoglycemia compared to insulin glargine in long-term care and skilled nursing facility residents with type 2 diabetes.", "id": "29289540", "date": "2017-12-27", "title": "A Randomized Controlled Study Comparing a DPP4 Inhibitor (Linagliptin) and Basal Insulin (Glargine) in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes in Long-Term Care and Skilled Nursing Facilities: Linagliptin-LTC Trial.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jamda.2017.11.002", "journal": ["Journal of the American Medical Directors Association", "J Am Med Dir Assoc"]}
