Diabetes status was obtained from 3 questionnaires and confirmed by 3 administrative data sources. Biomarkers were measured by standard assays 9.6\u00b12.1 years after cohort entry. We estimated diabetes risk as a time-varying outcome using Cox regression adjusted for body mass index assessed at 3 time points and other known confounders and computed adjusted means of biomarkers by sleep hours.During 7.9\u00b13.5 years of follow-up, 8487 new diabetes cases were diagnosed. Long sleep duration (\u22659 hours), as compared with 7-8 hours, was significantly associated with higher incidence (hazard ratio, 1.12; 95% confidence interval 1.04-1.21), but the 4% elevated incidence for short sleep duration (\u22646 hours) did not reach significance (95% confidence interval 0.99-1.09). After stratification, the associations appeared stronger in Japanese American than other ethnic groups and in participants without comorbidity. Hours of sleep were positively associated with C-reactive protein and triglycerides and inversely related to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and adiponectin but not with leptin levels and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance.In this multiethnic population, the 12% higher diabetes risk for long sleep hours may be mediated through inflammation, a poor lipid profile, and lower adiponectin levels.", "id": "29332675", "date": "2017-09-28", "title": "Sleep duration and incidence of type 2 diabetes: the Multiethnic Cohort.", "doi": "10.1016/j.sleh.2017.08.008", "journal": ["Sleep health", "Sleep Health"]}
