Intensive intervention was given at intervention worksite.High prevalence (%) of obesity (90.9, 80.2), abdominal obesity (93.5, 84.3), excess skinfold thickness (70.3, 75.9), and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) levels (56.8, 63.7) were seen in the intervention and the control group, respectively. At the end of intervention, the following significant changes were observed in the intervention group: decrease in weight, BMI, waist circumference, serum triglycerides, and increase in HDL-c. Weight loss of more than 5% was seen in 12% and 4% individuals in the intervention and control groups, respectively. Most importantly, the sum of all the skinfold measurements (mm) in the intervention group decreased significantly more than the control group (12.51\u2009\u00b1\u200910.38 versus 3.50\u2009\u00b1\u20098.18, resp.).This multicomponent worksite trial showed a reduction in weight, excess subcutaneous fat, and cardiometabolic risk factors after 6 months of active intervention in overweight Asian Indians.This trial is registered with NCT03249610.", "id": "29318159", "date": "2017-11-29", "title": "Randomized Control Trial for Reduction of Body Weight, Body Fat Patterning, and Cardiometabolic Risk Factors in Overweight Worksite Employees in Delhi, India.", "doi": "10.1155/2017/7254174", "journal": ["Journal of diabetes research", "J Diabetes Res"]}
