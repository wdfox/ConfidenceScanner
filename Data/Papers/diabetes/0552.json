However, the potential beneficial effects of swimming on insulin resistance and lipid disorder in T2DM, and its underlying mechanisms remain unclear.Rats were fed with high fat diet and given a low dosage of Streptozotocin (STZ) to induce T2DM model, and subsequently treated with or without swimming exercise. An 8-week swimming program (30, 60 or 120 min per day, 5 days per week) decreased body weight, fasting blood glucose and fasting insulin.Swimming ameliorated lipid disorder, improved muscular atrophy and revealed a reduced glycogen deposit in skeletal muscles of diabetic rats. Furthermore, swimming also inhibited the activation of Wnt3a/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway, decreased Wnt3a mRNA and protein level, upregulated GSK3\u03b2 phosphorylation activity and reduced the expression of \u03b2-catenin phosphorylation in diabetic rats.The trend of the result suggests that swimming exercise proved to be a potent ameliorator of insulin resistancein T2DM through the modulation of Wnt3a/\u03b2-catenin pathway and therefore, could present a promising therapeutic measure towards the treatment of diabetes and its relatives.", "id": "29299199", "date": null, "title": "Swimming training alleviated insulin resistance through Wnt3a/\u03b2-catenin signaling in type 2 diabetic rats.", "doi": "10.22038/IJBMS.2017.9473", "journal": ["Iranian journal of basic medical sciences", "Iran J Basic Med Sci"]}
