The aim of this study was to evaluate clinical correlates of DM, including management and outcomes, in the EURObservational Research Programme (EORP) - Atrial Fibrillation (AF) General Pilot (EORP-AF) Registry of the European Society of Cardiology.We studied consecutive patients (N\u2009=\u20093101) enrolled in 70 centers of 9 European countries between February 2012 and March 2013, and compared diabetics with non-diabetics during a one-year follow-up. In the overall cohort, the prevalence of DM was 20.6%. Diabetics were older (71\u00b19 vs. 68\u00b112 years, p\u2009<\u20090.0001) and had more comorbidities, higher CHA2DS2-VASc score (4.6\u00b11.6 vs. 2.9\u00b11.7, p\u2009<\u20090.0001) and higher prevalence of permanent AF (21.5 vs. 16.0%, p\u2009=\u20090.0022). Quality of life amongst DM patients was significantly worse (AF-QoL score: 45.2\u00b119.2 vs. 49.3\u00b120.1, p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Amongst diabetics, the use of electrical cardioversion (16.2 vs. 24.6%, p\u2009<\u20090.0001) and catheter ablation (3.3 vs. 8.6%, p\u2009<\u20090.0001) was lower, whilst oral anticoagulants were more often prescribed (84.3 vs. 78.9%, p\u2009=\u20090.0027). After one year, diabetic patients had significantly higher all-cause (11.9 vs. 4.9%, p\u2009<\u20090.0001), CV (6.2 vs. 1.9%, p\u2009<\u20090.0001) and non-CV mortality (2.3 vs. 1.1%, p\u2009=\u20090.0356).In AF patients, DM is associated with a higher prevalence of comorbidities and a worse quality of life. After one year, all-cause, CV and non-CV mortality were significantly higher in diabetic subjects.", "id": "29309557", "date": "2017-12-22", "title": "Management and prognosis of atrial fibrillation in diabetic patients: an EORP-AF General Pilot Registry report.", "doi": "10.1093/ehjcvp/pvx037", "journal": ["European heart journal.
