The National Diabetic Retinal Screening Programme (Diabetic RetinaScreen) was established to detect sight threatening retinopathies. The purpose of this cross-sectional study is to determine the barriers to the uptake of Diabetic RetinaScreen, to investigate discrepancies in attendance, if any, between patients whose diabetes care is delivered in a large tertiary referral hospital out-patient setting or in general practice, and to evaluate general practitioner&apos;s satisfaction with the service. Older age (OR 1.023, 95% CI 1.001 to 1.046) and complications of diabetes, excluding ocular complications, (OR 2.741, 95% CI 1.158 to 6.489) were associated with increased attendance at Diabetic RetinaScreen. Online referral is now available and the preferred method of referral. Efforts to encourage younger patients who do not yet have complications of diabetes may be beneficial.", "id": "29372943", "date": "2017-09-18", "title": "Investigating the Barriers to the Uptake of Diabetic RetinaScreen.", "doi": null, "journal": ["Irish medical journal", "Ir Med J"]}
