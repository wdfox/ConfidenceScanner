Methods Participation, self-monitoring behavior, weight loss, and cardiometabolic risk reduction were compared among 5091 women at high-risk for type 2 diabetes, with and without a history of GDM, enrolled in the Montana DPP between 2008 and 2015. Results Women with a history of GDM (6% of enrolled women, n\u2009=\u2009283) were significantly younger than women without GDM. No significant differences in participation, self-monitoring fat intake, achievement of the physical activity goal, or weight loss were found among women with and without a history of GDM. Overall, women lost an average of 5.0\u00a0kg (\u00b1\u20096.5), and 45 and 29% of women achieved 5 and 7% weight loss, respectively. Both groups lost significant and comparable amounts of weight. After adjusting for age and other factors, no differences were found in achievement of \u2265\u20095% weight loss (AOR 0.84; 95% CI 0.61-1.16) or the \u2265\u20097% weight loss goal (AOR 1.04; 95% CI 0.73-1.47) among women with and without a history of GDM. Conclusions for Practice Our findings suggest that women with and without a history of GDM successfully participate in and achieve significant weight loss in the DPP. Health care providers should identify and refer women with risk factors for type 2 diabetes, including a history of GDM, to a DPP within their community.", "id": "29288406", "date": "2017-12-29", "title": "Does a History of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus Affect Key Outcomes in Women Participating in a Diabetes Prevention Program?", "doi": "10.1007/s10995-017-2420-y", "journal": ["Maternal and child health journal", "Matern Child Health J"]}
