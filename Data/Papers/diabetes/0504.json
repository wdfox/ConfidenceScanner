This study aimed to evaluate the knowledge, perception and practice of healthcare professionals in diabetes management during fasting and the outcome of education on management.We surveyed healthcare professionals enrolled in pre-Ramadan education involving an endocrinologist, diabetes specialized nurse and dietician. The survey incorporated a knowledge test on fasting and safe practices of Diabetes management during Ramadan, and collected demographic data.Eighty-eight participants were enrolled. Mean age was 41.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f14.5\u202fyears, 14.9% males with a racial distribution of 44.8% Malays, 34.5% Chinese and 13.8% Indians. Fifty-two percent were Muslims. Eight percent were assistant nurses, 46% registered nurses, 5.7% advanced practice nurses, 17.2% specialist nurses, 14.9% general practitioners and 5% allied health professionals. Fifty-one percent practised in primary care setting. Mean knowledge score was 81.1%. Eighty-four percent would counsel people with diabetes for fasting, increasing to 96.7% after education. Those who would not cited a lack of knowledge or experience. During the past Ramadan, 75.9% provided counselling or adjusted medication whilst 51.1% managed diabetes complications, with 63.8% predominantly hypoglycaemia, 11.6% predominant hyperglycaemia and 24.6% only hypoglycaemia.The healthcare professionals had good knowledge and were capable in managing Muslims with diabetes during fasting themselves.
