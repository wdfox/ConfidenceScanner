We identified 585 colorectal cancer patients, 167 (28.6%) and 418 (71.5%) were as diabetic (DM) and nondiabetic, respectively. The diagnosis of diabetes did not impact cancer survival or extent of disease. Overall, DMs with metformin use (D+M+) have better overall survival than both DMs without metformin use (D+M\u223c) and nondiabetics (D\u223cM\u223c), with a mean survival of 109.9 months compared with 95.7 and 106.1 months, respectively (log-rank p < 0.05). The use of metformin shows significant reduction of risk of mortality compared with nonusers (hazard ratio: 0.34; 95% CI: 0.15-0.81; p = 0.01). Use of insulin and status of diabetes did not have a significant impact on overall cancer survival.", "id": "29308089", "date": "2017-06-21", "title": "Survival benefits in colorectal adenocarcinoma with the use of metformin among a black diabetic inner city population.", "doi": "10.2217/crc-2017-0001", "journal": ["Colorectal cancer", "Colorectal Cancer"]}
