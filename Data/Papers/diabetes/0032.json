Abnormal LVEF was defined as a resting ejection fraction <50% or a failure to increase ejection fraction with exercise by >5% (men) or a fall in ejection fraction with exercise (women). Cox proportional hazards models were used to predict the composite endpoint of MOD (first instance of major CAD, stroke, end-stage renal disease, blindness, amputation or diabetes-related death).Mean baseline age was 28 and diabetes duration 19\u202fyears. In a mean follow-up of 19\u202fyears, 50 MOD events were identified. Allowing for established risk factors at baseline, abnormal LVEF (n\u202f=\u202f22) independently predicted MOD incidence (HR\u202f=\u202f2.12, 95% CI: 1.12-4.00, p\u202f=\u202f0.022) but not major CAD (HR\u202f=\u202f1.33, 95% CI: 0.53-3.33, p\u202f=\u202f0.539).An abnormal LVEF may identify diabetic cardiomyopathy and predict long term risk of MOD (but not CAD alone) in type 1 diabetes individuals, consistent with it reflecting microvascular disease.", "id": "29366734", "date": "2017-12-28", "title": "Left ventricular systolic dysfunction predicts long-term major microvascular complication outcomes in type 1 diabetes.
