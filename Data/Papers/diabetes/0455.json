Localized drug delivery has the potential to improve transplant outcomes by providing sustained exposure to efficacious drug concentrations while avoiding systemic immunosuppression and off-target effects. Here, we describe the synthesis of a novel prodrug and its direct covalent conjugation to pancreatic islets via a cleavable linker. Post-transplant, linker hydrolysis results in the release of a potent anti-inflammatory antagonist of TLR4, localized to the site of implantation. This covalent islet modification significantly reduces the time and the minimal effective dose of islets necessary to achieve normoglycemia in a murine transplantation model. In streptozotocin-induced diabetic C57BL/6 mice a syngeneic transplant of \u223c100 modified islets achieved a 100% cure rate by the end of a 4-week monitoring period, compared to a 0% cure rate for untreated control islets. Overall, this direct prodrug conjugation to islets is well tolerated and preserves their functionality while affording significantly superior transplant outcomes. The development of drug-eluting tissues that deliver sustained and localized doses of small-molecule therapeutics represents a novel pathway for enhancing success in transplantation.", "id": "29309990", "date": "2017-12-28", "title": "Ex-vivo generation of drug-eluting islets improves transplant outcomes by inhibiting TLR4-Mediated NFkB upregulation.", "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.12.020", "journal": ["Biomaterials", "Biomaterials"]}
