But sometimes, even Mohs surgery isn't desirable because of predicted aggressive surgery. Treatment of recurrent basal cell carcinoma can be a challenge for dermatologists.We describe a case of a man with an invasive recurrent basal cell carcinoma on his face. The tumor was difficult to be removed completely by excision. Thus one-time photodynamic therapy was performed in the defect during surgery.No recurrence has been found at 1-year follow-up and the cosmetic result was excellent. \u2028 CONCLUSIONS: The tumor was successfully treated by combing surgery with photodynamic therapy at same time. This new strategy of treatment can be an option for cases as ours.", "id": "29288832", "date": "2017-12-27", "title": "New Combination Strategy of Photodynamic Therapy and Surgery in Treating Recurrent Basal Cell Carcinoma, a Case Report.", "doi": "10.1016/j.pdpdt.2017.12.013", "journal": ["Photodiagnosis and photodynamic therapy", "Photodiagnosis Photodyn Ther"]}
