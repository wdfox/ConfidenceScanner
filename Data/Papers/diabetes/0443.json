We investigated whether visceral adipose tissue (VAT) contributes to coronary artery calcifications (CAC) and cardiac dysfunction in T1DM.A cross-sectional study of 118 T1DM patients without a history of cardiovascular disease (men/women: 68/50, age 46\u00b112years, HbA1c 7.6\u00b10.9%, BMI 25.8\u00b14.1kg/m2) was conducted. CAC and VAT were measured using a CT scan. CAC was scored using the Agatston method. Cardiac functional abnormalities were assessed by echocardiography.CAC scored \u226510 in 42% of patients. Systolic function was normal in all, but diastolic dysfunction was present in 75%. Forty-six percent had VAT\u2265100cm2. CAC score\u226510 occurred more often in subjects with VAT\u2265100cm2 (54% vs 31%; p=0.01). Age (OR=1.10; p<0.0001), diabetes duration (OR=1.10; p=0.008), gender (OR=4.28; p=0.016), LDL-cholesterol (OR=1.03; p=0.009) and metabolic syndrome (OR=5.79; p=0.005) were independently associated with a CACS\u226510. Subjects with CACS\u226510 were more prone to have diastolic dysfunction (84 vs 54%; p=0.03). Factors independently associated with diastolic dysfunction were age (OR=1.11; p=0.002), waist circumference (OR=1.10; p=0.016) and VAT (OR=0.99; p=0.035).Excess VAT in T1DM, present in 46%, is associated with diastolic dysfunction and CAC, present in respectively 75% and 42% of patients.
