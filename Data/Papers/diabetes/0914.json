GDM is increasing worldwide and is associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. Neuregulin 4 (NGR4) is epidermal growth factor like signaling molecule. It plays an important role in cell to cell communication furthermore recent studies indicate that NRG4 may work as a novel adipokine with a possible role in maintaining energy and metabolic homeostasis. The aim of the present study was to assess serum NRG4 levels along with several metabolic parameters in patients diagnosed with gestational diabetic mellitus.In this prospective cross-sectional study, the study group was composed of 63 women with GDM and 64 healthy pregnant women matched for age, body mass index (BMI) and gestational age. Blood samples were collected at the 24-28th gestational weeks. Serum NRG4, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides, glucose levels during 75-gr OGTT, fasting insulin, glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatinine levels were measured. Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) values were calculated.Serum NRG4 values were significantly elevated in the GDM group compared to the control group (p\u2009<\u2009.001). Multivariate linear regression analyzes revealed that BMI (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.910, p\u2009<\u2009.001), glucose 2-h OGTT (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.866, p\u2009<\u2009.001) and HOMA-IR (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.222, p\u2009<\u2009.001) independently and positively predicted NRG4 levels.Serum NRG4 levels were associated with metabolic parameters of GDM. The present study can be considered to be a guide for future studies to clarify the pathophysiology of NGR4 in GDM patients.", "id": "29282998", "date": "2017-12-28", "title": "Clinical significance of neuregulin 4 (NRG4) in gestational diabetes mellitus.", "doi": "10.1080/09513590.2017.1420772", "journal": ["Gynecological endocrinology : the official journal of the International Society of Gynecological Endocrinology", "Gynecol.
