During 11 months of study progression, 176 women with GDM pregnancy and 86 healthy women underwent a fasting glucose test, 75-g OGTT and fasting lipid tests at 6-12 weeks postpartum. GDM was defined based on IADPSG criteria. Postpartum glucose intolerance was defined according to ADA criteria and metabolic syndrome using 2 sets of criteria.The overall rate of metabolic syndrome at 6-12 weeks postpartum was 16% by NCEP-ATP III criteria (18.2% in women with GDM and 11.6% in controls) and 19.1% by IDF criteria (21% in women with gestational diabetes and 15.1% in controls). Pre-pregnancy overweight or obesity, (OR 1.89, 95% CI: 1.05-3.38, P\u202f=\u202f.03), pregnancy systolic blood pressure (OR 1.03, 95% CI: 1.008-1.52, P\u202f=\u202f.006) and requiring insulin or metformin (OR 3.08, 95% CI: 1.25-7.60, P\u202f=\u202f0.01), were associated risk factors for the presence of MetS in GDM-exposed women. In women with normal glucose during pregnancy, pre-pregnancy BMI \u226525\u202fkg/m2 was a risk factor of metabolic syndrome (OR 2.82, 95% CI: 1.11-7.15, P\u202f=\u202f.02).The rate of metabolic syndrome in women with or without GDM at 6-12 weeks postpartum is high particularly in women with high BMI. An early postpartum prevention and screening program for cardiovascular risk factors is important for women with GDM.", "id": "29289537", "date": "2017-12-22", "title": "Early postpartum metabolic syndrome in women with or without gestational diabetes: Results from Life after Gestational Diabetes Ahvaz cohort study.", "doi": "10.1016/j.dsx.2017.12.027", "journal": ["Diabetes & metabolic syndrome", "Diabetes Metab Syndr"]}
