We used multinomial regression to evaluate the risk factors for pre-DM (glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c] \ue2f6 5.7-6.5% or fasting glucose 100-125 mg/dl) and DM (HbA1c \ue2f6 6.5% or fasting glucose \ue2f6 126 mg/dl or random blood glucose > 200 mg/dl or self-reported DM history/treatment) and the association of dysglycemia with the severity of TB disease.Among 1793 participants screened, 890 (50%) had microbiologically confirmed TB. Of these, 33% had pre-DM and 18% had DM; 41% were newly diagnosed. The median HbA1c level among newly diagnosed DM was 7.0% vs. 10.3% among known DM (P < 0.001). DM (adjusted OR [aOR] 4.94, 95%CI 2.33-10.48) and each per cent increase in HbA1c (aOR 1.42, 95%CI 1.01-2.01) was associated with >1+ smear grade or \ue2fa9 days to TB detection.Over half of newly diagnosed TB patients had DM or pre-DM. DM and increasing dysglycemia was associated with higher bacterial burden at TB diagnosis, potentially indicating a higher risk of TB transmission to close contacts.", "id": "29297449", "date": null, "title": "Prevalence of dysglycemia and clinical presentation of pulmonary tuberculosis in Western India.", "doi": "10.5588/ijtld.17.0474", "journal": ["The international journal of tuberculosis and lung disease : the official journal of the International Union against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease", "Int.
