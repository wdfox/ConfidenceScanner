The identification of effective therapeutic strategies to protect pancreatic cells from oxidative stress has increased interest in the screening of antioxidants from natural products. The present study aimed to investigate the protective effects of morin against streptozotocin\u00a0(STZ)\u2011induced cell damage in a rat insulinoma cell line\u00a0(RINm5F pancreatic \u03b2\u00a0cells) and to identify the underlying mechanisms. The results indicated that morin inhibited the increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species, attenuated the activity of poly (ADP\u2011ribose) polymerase, restored intracellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide levels and reduced the apoptotic cell death of STZ\u2011treated pancreatic \u03b2\u00a0cells. Treatment with morin significantly upregulated catalase in pancreatic \u03b2\u00a0cells, and ameliorated the STZ\u2011induced loss of catalase at the genetic, protein and enzymatic level. In further experiments, morin induced the phosphorylation of 5'\u00a0adenosine monophosphate\u2011activated protein kinase\u00a0(AMPK), which subsequently promoted the translocation of forkhead box\u00a0O3\u00a0(FOXO3) to the nucleus. Specific small interfering RNAs\u00a0(siRNAs) against AMPK and FOXO3 suppressed morin\u2011induced catalase expression. Furthermore, catalase\u2011specific siRNA abolished the protective effects of morin against STZ\u2011stimulated cell death. Taken together, these results indicated that morin protected RINm5F cells from STZ\u2011induced cell damage by triggering the phosphorylation of AMPK, thus resulting in subsequent activation of FOXO3 and induction of catalase.", "id": "29286118", "date": "2017-12-29", "title": "Amelioration of streptozotocin\u2011induced pancreatic \u03b2 cell damage by morin: Involvement of the AMPK\u2011FOXO3\u2011catalase signaling pathway.", "doi": "10.3892/ijmm.2017.3357", "journal": ["International journal of molecular medicine", "Int.
