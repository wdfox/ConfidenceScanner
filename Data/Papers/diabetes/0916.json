This study aims to determine metabolic alterations and type 2 diabetes risk among American Indian children who are obese or severely obese.Incidence rates of diabetes before 20\u2009years (youth-onset) and 45 years were computed in 2728 children who were from 5 to <10\u2009years and 4317 adolescents who were from 10 to <18 years without diabetes examined between 1965 and 2007. Obesity was defined as age-sex-adjusted body mass index (BMI) \u226595th percentile, and its severity was quantified as the percentage of the 95th percentile (%BMIp95 ).In the younger cohort, 0.9% of those non-obese and 2.9% of those with 100% to <120%BMIp95 had impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) compared to 8.6% of those with \u2265140%BMIp95 . In the older cohort, 2.9% of those non-obese and 9.8% of those with 100% to <120%BMIp95 had IGT compared to 13.3% of those with \u2265160%BMIp95 . The incidence of youth-onset diabetes was 3.8 and 4.9/1000 person-years in the child and adolescent cohorts, respectively, and before the age of 45 was 12.3 and 16.8/1000 person-years, respectively. Incidence rates of youth-onset diabetes in those with the most severe obesity (\u2265140%BMIp95 ) were 2.3 to 5.1 times as high as in those with the least severe obesity (100 to <120%BMIp95 ), and for onset of diabetes before the age of 45 were 1.6 to 2.2 times as high.Severe obesity in an American Indian population is a major driver of type 2 diabetes developing in adolescents and young adults.", "id": "29282818", "date": "2017-12-28", "title": "Effect of severe obesity in childhood and adolescence on risk of type 2 diabetes in youth and early adulthood in an American Indian population.", "doi": "10.1111/pedi.12627", "journal": ["Pediatric diabetes", "Pediatr Diabetes"]}
