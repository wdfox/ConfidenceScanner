The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between plasma homocysteine concentrations and T2DM.A cross-sectional study including 19,085 eligible participants derived from the Dongfeng-Tongji cohort was conducted. Plasma homocysteine concentrations were measured by Abbott Architect i2000 Automatic analyzer and T2DM was defined according to American Diabetes Association criteria. Logistic regression model was used to explore the association between plasma homocysteine concentrations and T2DM. The prevalence of T2DM was 19.0% in the whole population (mean age 62.9 years), 21.8% in males, and 17.1% in females. In the multivariable logistic regression analyses, compared with those in the lowest quintile, the OR (95% CI) of T2DM was 1.05 (0.92-1.21), 0.99 (0.86-1.14), 0.90 (0.78-1.05), and 0.77 (0.66-0.90) for quintile 2 to quintile 5 of homocysteine concentrations after adjustment for potential confounders (P for trend\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Homocysteine concentrations were associated with decreased T2DM prevalence risk (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.88 per SD increase of homocysteine concentration; 95% CI: 0.84-0.93). A significant interaction between homocysteine concentrations and drinking status on T2DM prevalence risk was observed (P for interaction\u00a0=\u00a00.03). The inverse association of plasma homocysteine concentrations with T2DM prevalence risk was observed in non-drinkers but not in current drinkers.Plasma homocysteine concentrations were inversely correlated with T2DM among a middle-aged and elderly Chinese population.", "id": "29337020", "date": "2017-12-07", "title": "Inverse association between plasma homocysteine concentrations and type 2 diabetes mellitus among a middle-aged and elderly Chinese population.", "doi": "10.1016/j.numecd.2017.11.009", "journal": ["Nutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases : NMCD", "Nutr Metab Cardiovasc Dis"]}
