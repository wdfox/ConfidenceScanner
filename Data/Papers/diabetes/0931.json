Individuals with T2D have an increased risk of developing AD, and conversely, AD patients have an increased risk of developing T2D. Evidence suggests that this link between AD and T2D might originate from a structural similarity between aggregates of A\u03b2 and hIAPP. Using the cryoEM method Micro-Electron Diffraction (MicroED) we determined the atomic structures of 11-residue segments from both A\u03b2 and hIAPP, termed A\u03b2 24-34 WT and hIAPP 19-29 S20G, with 64% sequence similarity. We observe a high degree of structural similarity between their backbone atoms (0.96 \u00c5 RMSD). Moreover, fibrils of these segments induce amyloid formation through self- and cross-seeding. Furthermore, inhibitors designed for one segment show cross-efficacy for full-length A\u03b2 and hIAPP and reduce cytotoxicity of both proteins, though by apparently blocking different cytotoxic mechanisms. The similarity of the atomic structures of A\u03b2 24-34 WT and hIAPP 19-29 S20G offers a molecular model for cross-seeding between A\u03b2 and hIAPP.", "id": "29282295", "date": "2017-12-27", "title": "Common fibrillar spines of amyloid-\u03b2 and human Islet Amyloid Polypeptide revealed by Micro Electron Diffraction and inhibitors developed using structure-based design.", "doi": "10.1074/jbc.M117.806109", "journal": ["The Journal of biological chemistry", "J.
