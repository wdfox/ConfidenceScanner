Both exenatide and metformin significantly decreased the HbA1c levels in overweight/obese patients with newly diagnosed T2D (all P < 0.05). The reduction in HbA1c and the proportion of patients with HbA1c\u2009<\u20097.0% (53\u2009mmol/mol) were higher in the exenatide group than in the metformin group (all P < 0.05). The exenatide treatment caused a greater decline in the body weight and BMI as compared to the metformin treatment (all P < 0.01). The exenatide treatment (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.41, P < 0.01) and baseline HbA1c level (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.84, P < 0.01) were independent influencing factors for the decrease in HbA1c level.For an initial therapy in overweight/obese patients with newly diagnosed T2D, exenatide causes a better glycemic control than metformin.
