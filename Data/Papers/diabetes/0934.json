Here, we demonstrate that MondoA, but not its paralogue ChREBP, is the predominant glucose-responsive transcription factor in human pancreatic beta EndoC-\u03b2H1 cells and in human islets. In high glucose conditions, MondoA shuttles to the nucleus where it is required for the induction of the glucose-responsive genes ARRDC4 and TXNIP, the latter being a protein strongly linked to beta-cell dysfunction and diabetes. Importantly, increasing cAMP signaling in human beta cells, using forskolin or the GLP-1 mimetic Exendin-4, inhibits the shuttling of MondoA and potently inhibits TXNIP and ARRDC4 expression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that silencing MondoA expression improves glucose uptake in EndoC-\u03b2H1 cells. These results highlight MondoA as a novel target in beta cells that coordinates transcriptional response to elevated glucose levels.", "id": "29282201", "date": "2017-12-27", "title": "MondoA is an Essential Glucose Responsive Transcription Factor in Human Pancreatic Beta Cells.", "doi": "10.2337/db17-0595", "journal": ["Diabetes", "Diabetes"]}
