Such ultrastructural connections synchronize cellular activity, confine biological heterogeneity, and enhance insulin pulsatility. Dysfunction of coupling has been associated with diabetes and altered \u03b2-cell function. However, the role of gap junctions between human \u03b2 cells is still largely unexplored. By using patch-clamp recordings of \u03b2 cells from human donors, we previously estimated electrical properties of these channels by mathematical modeling of pairs of human \u03b2 cells. In this work we revise our estimate by modeling triplet configurations and larger heterogeneous clusters. We find that a coupling conductance in the range 0.005-0.020\u00a0nS/pF can reproduce experiments in almost all the simulated arrangements. We finally explore the consequence of gap-junction coupling of this magnitude between \u03b2 cells with mutant variants of the ATP-sensitive potassium channels involved in some metabolic disorders and diabetic conditions, translating studies performed on rodents to the human case. Our results are finally discussed from the perspective of therapeutic strategies. In summary, modeling of more realistic clusters with more than two \u03b2 cells slightly lowers our previous estimate of gap-junction conductance and gives rise to patterns that more closely resemble experimental traces.", "id": "29346932", "date": "2017-09-06", "title": "Gap-junction coupling and ATP-sensitive potassium channels in human \u03b2-cell clusters: Effects on emergent dynamics.", "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevE.96.032403", "journal": ["Physical review.
