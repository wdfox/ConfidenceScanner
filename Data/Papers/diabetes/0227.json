It has a large number of pharmacological properties and is relatively free from adverse effects. As a part of Ontario Ginseng Research and Innovation Consortium, we investigated the effects of ginseng extract on diabetes and its complications. We demonstrated large number of beneficial effects of ginseng therapy and showed that these effects are possibly mediated through its antioxidant properties. Thus ginseng may lend itself as a relatively safe and inexpensive adjuvant treatment for diabetes and chronic diabetic complications.", "id": "29345436", "date": "2017-05-11", "title": "Effect of ginseng therapy on diabetes and its chronic complications: lessons learned.", "doi": "10.1515/jcim-2016-0166", "journal": ["Journal of complementary & integrative medicine", "J Complement Integr Med"]}
