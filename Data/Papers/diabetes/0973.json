Products containing docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) may raise LDL-C and should not be substituted for Rx eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)-only icosapent ethyl, which does not raise LDL-C. Omega-3 dietary supplements (e.g., fish oils containing EPA and DHA) may be used for general health promotion; however, they are not regulated as medications and concerns regarding quality, purity, safety, and variability of content exist. It is important to advise patients that omega-3 dietary supplements are not medications and should not be substituted for Rx omega-3s. Large-scale cardiovascular outcomes studies are underway for Rx omega-3s in statin-treated patients.Nurse practitioners can take an active role in reducing residual cardiovascular risk and educating patients about important differences between Rx omega-3s and fish oil supplements.", "id": "29280361", "date": null, "title": "Cardiovascular disease and omega-3s: Prescription products and fish oil dietary supplements are not the same.", "doi": "10.1002/2327-6924.12535", "journal": ["Journal of the American Association of Nurse Practitioners", "J Am Assoc Nurse Pract"]}
