The primary hypothesis was that ertugliflozin 15\u00a0mg was non-inferior to glimepiride on HbA1c (non-inferiority criterion: upper bound of the 95% confidence interval [CI] about the treatment difference\u00a0<\u00a00.3%).Mean baseline HbA1c of randomized patients (N\u00a0=\u00a01326) was 7.8%. Mean and median doses of glimepiride were 3.0\u00a0mg/day throughout the study. At week 52, the least squares\u00a0mean change (95% CI) from baseline in HbA1c was -\u00a00.6% (-\u00a00.7, -\u00a00.5), -\u00a00.6% (-\u00a00.6, -\u00a00.5), and -\u00a00.7% (-\u00a00.8, -\u00a00.7) in the ertugliflozin 15\u00a0mg, ertugliflozin 5\u00a0mg, and glimepiride groups, respectively. The between-group difference for ertugliflozin 15\u00a0mg and glimepiride of 0.1% (-\u00a00.0, 0.2) met the pre-specified non-inferiority criterion. Relative to glimepiride, greater body weight and systolic blood pressure (SBP) reductions were observed with ertugliflozin. The overall incidence of adverse events (AEs) was similar across groups. The incidence of symptomatic hypoglycemia and genital mycotic infection (GMI) were, respectively, lower and higher with ertugliflozin relative to glimepiride. The incidences of urinary tract infection and hypovolemia AEs were not meaningfully different among the groups.Ertugliflozin 15\u00a0mg was non-inferior to glimepiride in reducing HbA1c when added to metformin in patients with T2DM. Ertugliflozin had an acceptable safety profile and resulted in less hypoglycemia and more GMIs than glimepiride.Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01999218.", "id": "29282633", "date": "2017-12-27", "title": "Ertugliflozin Compared with Glimepiride in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Inadequately Controlled on Metformin: The VERTIS SU Randomized Study.", "doi": "10.1007/s13300-017-0354-4", "journal": ["Diabetes therapy : research, treatment and education of diabetes and related disorders", "Diabetes Ther"]}
