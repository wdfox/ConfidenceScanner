Time- and frequency-domain HRV measures are commonly reported in longitudinal adult and pediatric studies of health. While test-retest reliability has been established among adults, less is known about the psychometric properties of HRV among infants, children, and adolescents. The objective was to conduct a meta-analysis of the test-retest reliability of time- and frequency-domain HRV measures from infancy to adolescence. Electronic searches (PubMed, PsycINFO; January 1970-December 2014) identified studies with nonclinical samples aged \u2264 18 years; \u2265 2 baseline HRV recordings separated by \u2265 1 day; and sufficient data for effect size computation. Forty-nine studies (N = 5,170) met inclusion criteria. Methodological variables coded included factors relevant to study protocol, sample characteristics, electrocardiogram (ECG) signal acquisition and preprocessing, and HRV analytical decisions. Fisher's Z was derived as the common effect size. Analyses were age-stratified (infant/toddler < 5 years, n = 3,329; child/adolescent 5-18 years, n = 1,841) due to marked methodological differences across the pediatric literature. Meta-analytic results revealed HRV demonstrated moderate reliability; child/adolescent studies (Z = 0.62, r = 0.55) had significantly higher reliability than infant/toddler studies (Z = 0.42, r = 0.40). Relative to other reported measures, HF exhibited the highest reliability among infant/toddler studies (Z = 0.42, r = 0.40), while rMSSD exhibited the highest reliability among child/adolescent studies (Z = 1.00, r = 0.76). Moderator analyses indicated greater reliability with shorter test-retest interval length, reported exclusion criteria based on medical illness/condition, lower proportion of males, prerecording acclimatization period, and longer recording duration; differences were noted across age groups. HRV is reliable among pediatric samples. Reliability is sensitive to pertinent methodological decisions that require careful consideration by the researcher. Limited methodological reporting precluded several a priori moderator analyses. Suggestions for future research, including standards specified by Task Force Guidelines, are discussed.", "id": "29307951", "date": "2016-07-27", "title": "Test-Retest Reliability of Pediatric Heart Rate Variability: A Meta-Analysis.", "doi": "10.1027/0269-8803/a000161", "journal": ["Journal of psychophysiology", "J Psychophysiol"]}
