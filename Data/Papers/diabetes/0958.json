Dietary intakes of BCAAs including valine, leucine, and isoleucine were determined, using a valid and reliable food-frequency questionnaire. Hyperinsulinemia, \u03b2-cell dysfunction, insulin resistance (IR) and insulin insensitivity were determined according to optimal cut-off values. We used the logistic regression model to estimate the occurrence of IR across tertiles of BCAAs intake.Means (SD) for age and BCAA intake of participants (43% male) at baseline were 42.7 (13.1) years and 13.8 (5.1) g/day, respectively. Incidence of hyperinsulinemia, \u03b2-cell dysfunction, insulin insensitivity, and IR was 19.5, 24.0, 28.0, and 12.5%, respectively. After adjustment for confounding variables, subjects in the highest tertile of intakes of total BCAAs (OR=1.67, 95% CI: 1.03-2.71), leucine (OR=1.75, 95% CI:1.09-2.82), and valine (OR=1.61, 95% CI: 1.01-2.60) had greater risk of incident IR in comparison to those in the lowest one. However, higher intakes of isoleucine were not associated with risk of incident IR. Furthermore, total BCAAs, leucine, isoleucine, and valine intakes were not associated with risk of hyperinsulinemia, insulin insensitivity, and \u03b2-cell dysfunction.Our findings support the hypothesis that higher intakes of BCAAs may have adverse effects on development of IR.", "id": "29281182", "date": "2017-12-27", "title": "High dietary intakes of branched-chain amino acids is associated with increased risk of insulin resistance in adults.", "doi": "10.1111/1753-0407.12639", "journal": ["Journal of diabetes", "J Diabetes"]}
