Over the past 10-15 years, it has become clear that epitopes recognized by CD8+, and more recently CD4+ T cells, can be formed by protein splicing. Here, we review the discovery of spliced epitopes recognized by tumor-specific human CD8+ T cells. We discuss how these epitopes are formed and some of the unusual variants that have been reported. Now, over a decade since the first report, evidence is emerging that spliced CD8+ T-cell epitopes are much more common, and potentially much more important, than previously imagined. Recent work has shown that epitopes recognized by CD4+ T cells can also be formed by protein splicing. We discuss the recent discovery of spliced CD4+ T-cell epitopes and their potential role as targets of autoimmune T-cell responses. Finally, we highlight some of the new questions raised from our growing appreciation of T-cell epitopes formed by peptide splicing.", "id": "29359347", "date": "2017-12-07", "title": "Shuffling peptides to create T-cell epitopes: does the immune system play cards?", "doi": "10.1111/imcb.1015", "journal": ["Immunology and cell biology", "Immunol.
