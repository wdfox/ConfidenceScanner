Secondary measurements: associations of measured miRs with changes in bone mineral density (BMD) at 12 months and the bone turnover markers (BTM) C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (\u03b2-CTX) and procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (P1NP) at 3 and 12 months.We found significantly decreased therelative expression of miR-33-3p at 3 months (p=0.03) and of miR-133a at 12 months (p=0.042) of teriparatide treatment. BMD values at 12 months of teriparatide treatment were significantly and inversely correlated with miR-124-3p expression at 3 months (p=0.008). Relative expression of miR-24-3p and miR-27a was correlated with changes in BTM during teriparatide treatment and of miR-21-5p, miR-23a-3p, miR-26a-5p, miR-27a, miR-222-5p and miR-335-5p with changes in BTM during denosumab treatment.Circulating miRs are differentially affected by treatment with teriparatide and denosumab. Teriparatide affects the relative expression of mirRs related to the expression of RUNX-2 (miR-33) and DKK-1 gene (miR-133).", "id": "29309589", "date": "2017-12-22", "title": "Changes of circulating micro-RNAs in response to treatment with teriparatide or denosumab in postmenopausal osteoporosis.", "doi": "10.1210/jc.2017-02406", "journal": ["The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism", "J.
