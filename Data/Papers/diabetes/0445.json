Similar results were found for the 3 other measures of variability, standard deviation, coefficient of variability, and variability independent of the mean. Similar results were seen for CV events, stroke, and nonfatal myocardial infarction. Higher variability in triglyceride and LDL-cholesterol, but not HDL-cholesterol, was predictive of incident diabetes. The correlation among the variability of the 3 lipid measurements was weak.Visit-to-visit variability in fasting measurements of HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL-cholesterol are predictive of coronary events, CV events, and for triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol variability, incident diabetes. The mechanisms accounting for these associations remain to be determined.", "id": "29310989", "date": "2017-12-20", "title": "Visit-to-visit variability of lipid measurements as predictors of cardiovascular events.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jacl.2017.12.003", "journal": ["Journal of clinical lipidology", "J Clin Lipidol"]}
