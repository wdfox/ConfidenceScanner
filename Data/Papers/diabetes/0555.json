Participants were randomly divided into four groups to receive: 1) 1000\u00a0mg omega-3 fatty acids containing 180\u00a0mg eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 120\u00a0mg docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) twice a day\u2009+\u2009vitamin D placebo (n\u2009=\u200930); 2) 50,000\u00a0IU vitamin D every 2\u00a0weeks\u2009+\u2009omega-3 fatty acids placebo (n\u2009=\u200930); 3) 50,000\u00a0IU vitamin D every 2\u00a0weeks\u2009+\u20091000\u00a0mg omega-3 fatty acids twice a day (n\u2009=\u200930) and 4) vitamin D placebo\u2009+\u2009omega-3 fatty acids placebo (n\u2009=\u200930) for 6\u00a0weeks.Subjects who received vitamin D plus omega-3 fatty acids supplements compared with vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acids and placebo had significantly decreased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (-2.0\u2009\u00b1\u20093.3 vs. -0.8\u2009\u00b1\u20094.4, -1.3\u2009\u00b1\u20092.4 and +0.9\u2009\u00b1\u20092.7\u00a0mg/L, respectively, P\u2009=\u20090.008), malondialdehyde (-0.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5 vs. -0.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5, -0.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.9 and +0.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.4\u00a0\u03bcmol/L, respectively, P\u2009<\u20090.001), and increased total antioxidant capacity (+92.1\u2009\u00b1\u200970.1 vs. +55.1\u2009\u00b1\u2009123.6, +88.4\u2009\u00b1\u200995.2 and +1.0\u2009\u00b1\u200990.8\u00a0mmol/L, respectively, P\u2009=\u20090.001) and glutathione (+95.7\u2009\u00b1\u200986.7 vs. +23.0\u2009\u00b1\u200962.3, +30.0\u2009\u00b1\u200966.5 and -7.8\u2009\u00b1\u2009126.5\u00a0\u03bcmol/L, respectively, P\u2009=\u20090.001). In addition, vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids co-supplementation, compared with vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acids and placebo, resulted in lower incidences of newborns' hyperbilirubinemiain (P\u2009=\u20090.037) and newborns' hospitalization (P\u2009=\u20090.037).Overall, vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids co-supplementation for 6\u00a0weeks among GDM women had beneficial effects on some biomarkers of inflammation, oxidative stress and pregnancy outcomes.", "id": "29299042", "date": "2017-12-28", "title": "The effects of vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids co-supplementation on biomarkers of inflammation, oxidative stress and pregnancy outcomes in patients with gestational diabetes.", "doi": "10.1186/s12986-017-0236-9", "journal": ["Nutrition & metabolism", "Nutr Metab (Lond)"]}
