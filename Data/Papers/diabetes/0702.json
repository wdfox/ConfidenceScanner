The aim of this study was to longitudinally review the nutritional and gastrointestinal aspects of A-T.This was a retrospective chart review of patients followed from 1986 to 2015 at one center. Demographic, laboratory, and nutritional data were retrieved. Body mass index (BMI) values were converted to BMI Z-score (BMI-Z). Caloric intake was estimated by food diaries and compared with estimated energy requirements for sex and age with a physical activity level factor for light physical activity.The study included 53 patients (28 males [53%], ages 14.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.2\u00a0y). BMI-Z was inversely correlated with age (r\u00a0=\u00a00.48; P\u00a0<\u00a00.004). A decline below minimal BMI percentiles was observed after the age of 4\u00a0y in boys and 7\u00a0y in girls. The relative percentage of caloric intake decreased with age (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.5; P\u00a0<\u00a00.002), and was positively correlated with BMI-Z (r\u00a0=\u00a00.35; P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Presence of cough during meals was associated with recurrent lower respiratory tract infections (Fisher exact test, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Gastrostomy tubes were inserted in 12 patients, leading to improvement in BMI-Z from -5.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.4 to -4 \u00b1 2.9 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).There is a progressive growth failure and low nutritional intake with age in patients with A-T, starting in early childhood in males, and more prominent in patients with cough and choking during meals. A proactive approach and insertion of a percutaneous gastrostomy tube as soon as the BMI-Z starts to decrease should be considered.", "id": "29290356", "date": "2017-08-24", "title": "Long-term nutritional and gastrointestinal aspects in patients with ataxia telangiectasia.", "doi": "10.1016/j.nut.2017.08.008", "journal": ["Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)", "Nutrition"]}
