Moreover, there are no data in this population evaluating changes in ischemia assessed with serial myocardial perfusion imaging. Consecutive patients (n\u2009=\u2009649) with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) were referred for cardiovascular risk stratification before renal transplantation between 2007 and 2013. Of these, 151 patients (54\u2009\u00b1\u20099 years) underwent 2 stress-rest technetium-99m single-photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) studies with CT attenuation correction in accordance with regional guidelines, which recommend repeat imaging in high-risk subjects who have not undergone renal transplantation within 3 years. An abnormal perfusion result was defined as a summed stress score \u22654. The median interval between imaging was 39 months. At baseline, 28% of patients (42/151) had abnormal SPECT perfusion, half with a fixed defect. Nine subjects (6%) underwent revascularization between SPECT studies after the baseline imaging demonstrated an ischemic perfusion defect size affecting \u226510% of the myocardium. On repeat imaging, 60% (25/42) had abnormal perfusion. In the 72% (109 of 151) with normal baseline SPECT perfusion, 19% (21/109) demonstrated new ischemia at follow-up and 3% (3/109) had an ischemic perfusion defect size \u226510%. The development of new-onset ischemia was associated with systolic hypertension (p\u2009=\u20090.015), serum phosphate (p\u2009=\u20090.043), and Agatston score (p\u2009=\u20090.002), but not diabetes (p\u2009=\u20090.12). In conclusion, there is a high frequency of new-onset ischemia in patients with ESRD awaiting renal transplantation. Further study is needed to define the optimal timing for repeat stress testing.", "id": "29291889", "date": "2017-12-11", "title": "Results of Serial Myocardial Perfusion Imaging in End-Stage Renal Disease.", "doi": "10.1016/j.amjcard.2017.11.038", "journal": ["The American journal of cardiology", "Am.
