We have previously identified several series of FFA1 agonists with different heterocyclic scaffolds. Herein, we describe the structural exploration of other heterocyclic scaffolds directed by drug-like physicochemical properties. Further structure-based design and chiral resolution provided the most potent compound 11 (EC50\u202f=\u202f7.9\u202fnM), which exhibited improved lipophilicity (LogD7.4: 1.93), ligand efficiency (LE\u202f=\u202f0.32) and ligand lipophilicity efficiency (LLE\u202f=\u202f6.2). Moreover, compound 11 revealed an even better pharmacokinetic property than that of TAK-875 in terms of plasma clearance, maximum concentration, and plasma exposure. Although robust agonistic activity and PK profiles for compound 11, the glucose-lowering effects in vivo is not ideal, and the exact reason for in vitro/in vivo difference was worthy for further exploration.", "id": "29291938", "date": "2017-12-24", "title": "Identification of highly potent and orally available free fatty acid receptor 1 agonists bearing isoxazole scaffold.", "doi": "10.1016/j.bmc.2017.12.030", "journal": ["Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry", "Bioorg.
