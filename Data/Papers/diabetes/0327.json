Based on the clinical presentation and involvement, mucormycosis is classified as six major forms, namely, rhinocerebral, pulmonary, cutaneous, gastrointestinal (GI), disseminated and miscellaneous, with rhinocerebral and pulmonary being the common forms. GI mucormycosis is rare, accounting for only 7% of all cases; however, the mortality rate is as high as 85%. Here we report a case of a young immunocompetent male who developed gastric invasive mucormycosis during an acute illness and succumbed to it despite all supportive care.", "id": "29327534", "date": null, "title": "Gastric Angioinvasive Mucormycosis in Immunocompetent Adult, A Rare Occurrence.", "doi": null, "journal": ["The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India", "J Assoc Physicians India"]}
