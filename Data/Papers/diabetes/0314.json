However, whether or not hepatocyte ER\u03b1 regulates reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) in mice has not yet been reported.Using LKO-ER\u03b1 mice and wild-type (WT) littermates fed a Western-type diet, we found that deletion of hepatocyte ER\u03b1 impaired in\u00a0vivo RCT measured by the removal of 3H-cholesterol from macrophages to the liver, and subsequently to feces, in female mice but not in male mice. Deletion of hepatocyte ER\u03b1 decreased the capacity of isolated HDL to efflux cholesterol from macrophages and reduced the ability of isolated hepatocytes to accept cholesterol from HDL ex\u00a0vivo in both sexes. However, only in female mice, LKO-ER\u03b1 increased serum cholesterol levels and increased HDL particle sizes. Deletion of hepatocyte ER\u03b1 increased adiposity and worsened insulin resistance to a greater degree in female than male mice. All of the changes lead to a 5.6-fold increase in the size of early atherosclerotic lesions in female LKO-ER\u03b1 mice compared to WT controls.Estrogen signaling through hepatocyte ER\u03b1 plays an important role in RCT and is protective against lipid retention in the artery wall during early stages of atherosclerosis in female mice fed a Western-type diet.", "id": "29331506", "date": "2017-12-29", "title": "Hepatocyte estrogen receptor alpha mediates estrogen action to promote reverse cholesterol transport during Western-type diet feeding.", "doi": "10.1016/j.molmet.2017.12.012", "journal": ["Molecular metabolism", "Mol Metab"]}
