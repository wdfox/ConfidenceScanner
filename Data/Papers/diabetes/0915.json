Distinct classes of kinases generate different forms of energetic diphosphate-containing IPPs from inositol phosphates (IPs). Conversely, polyphosphate phosphohydrolase enzymes dephosphorylate IPPs to regenerate the respective IPs. IPPs and/or their metabolizing enzymes regulate various cell biological processes by modulating many proteins via diverse mechanisms. In the last decade, extensive research has been conducted in mammalian systems, particularly in knockout mouse models of relevant enzymes. Results obtained from these studies suggest impacts of the IPP pathway on organ development, especially of brain and testis. Conversely, deletion of specific enzymes in the pathway protects mice from various diseases such as diet-induced obesity (DIO), type-2 diabetes (T2D), fatty liver, bacterial infection, thromboembolism, cancer metastasis and aging. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of the same class of enzymes in mice validates the therapeutic importance of this pathway in cardio-metabolic diseases. This review critically analyses these findings and summarizes the significance of the IPP pathway in mammalian health and diseases. It also evaluates benefits and risks of targeting this pathway in disease therapies. Finally, future directions of mammalian IPP research are discussed.", "id": "29282838", "date": "2017-12-27", "title": "The inositol pyrophosphate pathway in health and diseases.", "doi": "10.1111/brv.12392", "journal": ["Biological reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society", "Biol Rev Camb Philos Soc"]}
