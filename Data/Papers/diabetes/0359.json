Recent studies indicate that majority of people with type 2 diabetes also has OSA. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and severity of OSA and risk factors contributing to it among people with chronic and severe type 2 diabetes.A total of 203 people with type 2 diabetes (mean age: 54\u00b18 years, 145 males, 58 females, HbA1c \u22657% [53mmol/mol]) attending a diabetes specialty hospital were included in the study; all were subjected to comprehensive diabetic evaluation and Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI) was used to evaluate OSA.23.65% of the study subjects had OSA (AHI \u226515). OSA was more prevalent among men compared to women. BMI, was significantly higher among subjects with OSA (P=0.01). People with OSA had higher percentage of diabetic complications such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), retinopathy and neuropathy. Hypertension was identified as independent predictors of OSA.Prevalence of OSA was higher in this study compared to Indian studies hitherto. Since OSA is treatable, people with diabetes should be screened for this condition to reduce their CVD risk.", "id": "29322708", "date": null, "title": "High Prevalence of Obstructive Sleep Apnea among People with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in a Tertiary Care Center.", "doi": null, "journal": ["The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India", "J Assoc Physicians India"]}
