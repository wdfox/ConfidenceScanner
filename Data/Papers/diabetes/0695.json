Anthropometric measurements and blood pressure values were recorded. Fasting blood glucose, insulin and lipid levels were measured. The TG/HDL ratio, HOMA-IR, and QUICKI indexes were calculated. Subjects were categorized as with and without cardiometabolic risk based on the presence or absence of 2or more risk factors. Cut-off points for the TG/HDL ratio were determined by constructing ROC curves.Significantly higher mean TG/HDL ratios were found in pubertal (2.2 \u00b1 1.7) as compared to prepubertal subjects (1.8 \u00b1 1.5; P=.001), with no sex differences. Two or more risk factors were found in 14.7% (n=192) of the participants, in whom TG/HDL ratios were significantly higher as compared to those with no risk (3.5\u00b12.9 versus 1.6\u00b10.8 in prepubertal and 4.1 \u00b1 3.5 versus 1.8 \u00b1 0.9 in pubertal subjects; P=.0001). According to cardiometabolic risk, cut-off points for the TG/HDL ratio of 1.8 and 2.5\u00a0were found for prepubertal and pubertal children respectively. These cut-off points showed risks (odds ratio) higher than 2.5 for conditions such as metabolic syndrome, elevated non-HDL-C, abdominal obesity, and elevated HOMA-IR.In this sample of children and adolescents, an elevated TG/HDLc ratio was found to be a good marker for predicting cardiometabolic risk.", "id": "29290474", "date": "2017-12-28", "title": "Triglycerides/High density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio as a cardiometabolic risk marker in children and adolescents from M\u00e9rida city, Venezuela.", "doi": "10.1016/j.endinu.2017.10.010", "journal": ["Endocrinologia, diabetes y nutricion", "Endocrinol Diabetes Nutr"]}
