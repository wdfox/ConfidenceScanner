Methods: A total of 8 943 consecutive cases with TVD hospitalized in our center from April 2004 to February 2011 were screened for this study. In this cohort, 3 435 cases diagnosed as SCAD were analyzed. PCI, CABG, MT alone were performed in 1 313 (38.2%), 1 259 (36.7%) and 863 (25.1%) patients, respectively. Propensity score matching (PSM) analysis using nearest neighbor matching with a 1\u22361 ratio was applied, and 758 pairs of CABG and PCI groups, 552 pairs of PCI and MT groups, 639 pairs of CABG and MT groups were selected, respectively. 1- and 2-year clinical outcomes were evaluated among PCI, CABG and MT group. Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariable Cox regression method were used for survival analysis. Results: Significant differences were found at baseline between PCI, CABG and MT group, including age, gender, body mass index, family history of coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, previous myocardial infarction, stroke, previous revascularization, peripheral vascular disease, SNYTAX score, left ventricular ejection fraction, hemoglobin, serum creatinine, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, triglyceride and medication (all P<0.05) . All-cause death rates of 1- and 2-year follow-up of PCI, CABG and MT group were 0.6% (8/1 313), 1.1% (14/1 259), 3.4% (29/863) (P<0.001) and 1.1%(14/1 313), 1.5%(19/1 259), 7.3%(63/863) (P<0.001), respectively. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that 1-year MACCE rate (HR=0.51, 95%CI 0.33-0.77, P=0.001) was significantly reduced, due to the significant decrease of myocardial infarction (MI) rate (HR=0.09, 95%CI 0.01-0.76, P=0.027) and repeat revascularization rate (HR=0.21, 95%CI 0.10-0.41, P<0.001) in CABG group compared to PCI group, while all-cause death (HR=1.21, 95%CI 0.48-3.00, P=0.69) and stroke rate (HR=2.31, 95%CI 0.82-6.47, P=0.112) were similar between 2 groups. 2-year outcome showed CABG was associated with higher stroke rate (HR=2.20, 95%CI 1.06-4.55, P=0.034) and lower MI (HR=0.19, 95%CI 0.06-0.59, P=0.004) and repeat revascularization rate (HR=0.22, 95%CI 0.13-0.37, P<0.001), and lower MACCE rate (HR=0.49, 95%CI 0.36-0.68, P<0.001). Compared to MT group, 2-year all-cause death (HR=0.22, 95%CI 0.12-0.42, P<0.001) and MACCE rate (HR=0.63, 95%CI 0.47-0.83, P=0.001) were lower in PCI group, while 2-year all-cause death (HR=0.21, 95%CI 0.13-0.37, P<0.001), MACCE (HR=0.31, 95%CI 0.23-0.42, P<0.001), MI (HR=0.19, 95%CI 0.06-0.60, P=0.004) and repeat revascularization rate (HR=0.24, 95%CI 0.13-0.41, P<0.001) were lower in CABG group. Results of multivariate Cox regression analysis after PSM were consistent with above results. Conclusion: For SCAD patients with TVD, CABG shows better effectiveness by reducing MI and revascularization risk as compared to PCI, even though stroke risk is somehow higher in CABG patients. Patients received MT alone are associated with worse outcomes than those undergoing revascularization strategies.\u76ee\u7684\uff1a
