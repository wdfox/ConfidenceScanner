Data about age and family history of diabetes were collected. For diabetic patients, data related to disease history were also enquired about. Weight and height were measured and body mass index (BMI) was calculated. Blood examination was done to estimate fasting plasma glucose and PSA.The mean ages of diabetic and non-diabetic patients were 55.2 \u00b1 10.5 and 55.9 \u00b1 10.9 years, respectively. The mean total serum PSA was significantly lower among diabetic than non-diabetic men (1.97 \u00b1 1.05 ng/ml vs. 2.60 \u00b1 1.22 ng/ml, respectively, P = 0.001). The multivariate linear regression analysis showed that age, DM and BMI were independent predictors of serum PSA variation. Age was significantly related to PSA in non-diabetics, but not in diabetic patients.Serum PSA level is significantly lower and less age dependent in type 2 diabetic patients than in non-diabetics. Therefore, DM should be considered in setting of PSA threshold when screening for prostate cancer.", "id": "29355164", "date": null, "title": "Serum level of prostate-specific antigen in diabetic patients in Basrah, Iraq.", "doi": "10.4103/npmj.npmj_174_17", "journal": ["The Nigerian postgraduate medical journal", "Niger Postgrad Med J"]}
