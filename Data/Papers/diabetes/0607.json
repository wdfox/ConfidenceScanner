However, actual patients suffer from multiple conditions and CPGs that are usually single-disease-focused provide disease-specific recommendations with no support on how to manage adverse interactions between the recommended treatments. We have developed GO-DSS, a CDSS that implements an ontological reasoning process to perform CPG reconciliation. GO-DSS is applied to the concurrent management of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and dyslipidemia. We proposed an innovative graphical interface to display medication recommendations as \"therapeutic circles\". A qualitative evaluation of the system and of this graphical layout has been performed on simulated patient cases by a sample of 12 users with various backgrounds (think aloud method). The resulting usability of the system is highly appreciated with a mean rating of 90.7% according to the standardized System Usability Scale.", "id": "29295282", "date": null, "title": "Using Therapeutic Circles to Visualize Guideline-Based Therapeutic Recommendations for Patients with Multiple Chronic Conditions: A Case Study with GO-DSS on Hypertension, Type 2 Diabetes, and Dyslipidemia.", "doi": null, "journal": ["Studies in health technology and informatics", "Stud Health Technol Inform"]}
