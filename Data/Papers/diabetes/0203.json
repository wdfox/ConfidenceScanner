It can be caused by repeated micro trauma or also predisposed by systemic diseases such as diabetes mellitus and connective tissue disorders that can in turn lead to extensor mechanism deficits. Although a trial of conservative treatment is advocated, operative treatment should be performed in cases of persistent pain, extension deficit, or complete rupture of the tendon. The purpose of this Technical Note is to describe in detail a procedure for open repair of a quadriceps tendon, with significant degeneration due to quadriceps tendinopathy, using suture anchors and semitendinosus tendon allograft augmentation.", "id": "29348999", "date": "2017-11-06", "title": "Open Repair of Quadriceps Tendon With Suture Anchors and Semitendinosus Tendon Allograft Augmentation.", "doi": "10.1016/j.eats.2017.08.005", "journal": ["Arthroscopy techniques", "Arthrosc Tech"]}
