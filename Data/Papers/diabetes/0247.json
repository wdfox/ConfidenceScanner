In relation to glycemic control, the procedure demonstrated remission of diabetes in up to 60% after one year of surgery. After three years, however, differences in remission rate between surgical and clinical group was not observed, questioning the durability of the technical in a long-term.Despite showing good results, both in the weight loss and co-morbidities, conflicting results reinforce the need for more studies to prove the efficiency of the vertical sleeve gastrectomy as well as to understand its action about the molecular mechanisms involved in the disease.", "id": "29340555", "date": null, "title": "THE ROLE OF THE SLEEVE GASTRECTOMY AND THE MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES.", "doi": "10.1590/0102-6720201700040013", "journal": ["Arquivos brasileiros de cirurgia digestiva : ABCD = Brazilian archives of digestive surgery", "Arq Bras Cir Dig"]}
