Most SGA infants (85-90%) demonstrate spontaneous catch-up growth, typically in the first year after birth. Although catch-up growth (CUG) is a desired goal, it is important to note if CUG is too rapid the infants are at increased risk for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus as they become adults. On the flip side, infants who do not exhibit CUG are also at increased risk of adverse adult outcomes including those for cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus, neurodevelopmental and cognitive impairments, in addition to adult short stature. Treatment with growth hormone is safe and effective not only in increasing adult height, but also in improving body composition and decreasing metabolic complications. The aims of this review are to summarize the current knowledge on what constitutes \"healthy\" catch-up growth in children born SGA as well as provide an update on the role of growth hormone treatment for short children born SGA.", "id": "29291885", "date": "2017-12-28", "title": "Short children born small for gestational age outcomes in the era of growth hormone therapy.", "doi": "10.1016/j.ghir.2017.12.013", "journal": ["Growth hormone & IGF research : official journal of the Growth Hormone Research Society and the International IGF Research Society", "Growth Horm.
