NCT02715193, clinicaltrials.gov) was to study the efficacy and safety of REMD-477, a glucagon receptor antagonist, in type 1 diabetes. This was a randomized controlled trial in which 21 patients with type 1 diabetes were enrolled. Glycaemic control and insulin use were evaluated in outpatient and inpatient settings, before and after a single 70-mg dose of REMD-477 (half-life 7-10\u2009days) or placebo. Inpatient insulin use was 26% (95% CI, 47%, 4%) lower 1 day after dosing with REMD-477 than with placebo (P\u2009=\u2009.02). Continuous glucose monitoring during post-treatment days 6 to 12 showed that average daily glucose was 27\u2009mg/dL lower (P\u2009<\u2009.001), percent time-in-target-range (70-180\u2009mg/dL) was ~25% greater (~3.5 h/d) (P\u2009=\u2009.001), and percent time-in-hyperglycaemic-range (>\u2009180\u2009mg/dL) was ~40% lower (~4\u2009h/d) (P\u2009=\u2009.001) in the REMD-477 group than in the placebo group, without a difference in percent time-in-hypoglycaemic-range (<70\u2009mg/dL). No serious adverse events were reported.
