We measured plasma sOb-R with ELISA, insulin sensitivity with hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp, and mRNA in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue with high-throughput sequencing.Baseline plasma sOb-R was strongly associated with baseline glucose infusion rate (GIR) (\u03b2[95% CI]:1.19 [0.57-1.82] mg/kg/min, p=0.0006) and GIR improvement after the exercise intervention (0.58 [0.03-1.12] mg/kg/min, p=0.039), also independently of covariates including plasma leptin. In pathway analyses, high plasma sOb-R correlated with upregulation of metabolic pathways and downregulation of inflammatory pathways in both adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. In skeletal muscle, mRNA of LEPROT and LEPROTL1 (involved in Ob-R cell surface expression) and ADAM10 and ADAM17 (involved sOb-R-shedding) increased after the exercise intervention.Higher plasma sOb-R were associated with improved GIR, upregulation of metabolic pathways and downregulation of inflammatory pathways, which may be possible mechanisms for the seemingly protective effect of plasma sOb-R on subsequent risk of gestational and type 2 diabetes found in observational studies.", "id": "29300960", "date": "2017-12-28", "title": "Soluble leptin receptor predicts insulin sensitivity and correlates with upregulation of metabolic pathways in men.", "doi": "10.1210/jc.2017-02126", "journal": ["The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism", "J.
