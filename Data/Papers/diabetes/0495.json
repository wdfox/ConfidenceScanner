Electronic address: khpark@gnu.ac.kr."]], "text": "Cratoxylum cochinchinense displayed significant inhibition against protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and \u03b1-glucosidase, both of which are key target enzymes to attenuate diabetes and obesity. The compounds responsible for both enzymes inhibition were identified as twelve xanthones (1-12) among which compounds 1 and 2 were found to be new ones. All of them simultaneously inhibited PTP1B with IC50s of (2.4-52.5\u202f\u00b5M), and \u03b1-glucosidase with IC50 values of (1.7-72.7\u202f\u00b5M), respectively. Cratoxanthone A (3) and \u03b3-mangostin (7) were estimated to be most active inhibitors against both PTP1B (IC50\u202f=\u202f2.4\u202f\u00b5M for 3, 2.8\u202f\u00b5M for 7) and \u03b1-glucosidase (IC50\u202f=\u202f4.8\u202f\u00b5M for 3, 1.7\u202f\u00b5M for 7). In kinetic studies, all isolated xanthones emerged to be mixed inhibitors of \u03b1-glucosidase, whereas they behaved as competitive inhibitors of PTP1B. In time dependent experiments, compound 3 showed isomerization inhibitory behavior with following kinetic parameters: Kiapp\u202f=\u202f2.4\u202f\u00b5M; k5\u202f=\u202f0.05001\u202f\u00b5M-1\u202fS-1 and k6\u202f=\u202f0.02076\u202f\u00b5M-1\u202fS-1.", "id": "29306546", "date": "2017-12-26", "title": "Inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and \u03b1-glucosidase by xanthones from Cratoxylum cochinchinense, and their kinetic characterization.", "doi": "10.1016/j.bmc.2017.12.043", "journal": ["Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry", "Bioorg.
