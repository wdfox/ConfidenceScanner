Statistical analysis was performed by the SPSS program version 17. Categorical variables were analyzed using either the Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. Pregnant women who underwent oral glucose tolerance test at 24-28 weeks of gestation were enrolled. We took 25 women with GDM as cases and 25 normal pregnant as control. These patients were analyzed for the level of hs-CRP.The prevalence of elevated hs-CRP in controls was 28% whereas in cases was 76%, with a P = 0.002 which is significant in this study. When compared to elevated hs-CRP in GDM with body mass index and gravid state a P = 0.430, 0.378 was obtained respectively which was not significant whereas age had a P = 0.049 which was significantly associated with elevated hs-CRP (\u22653 mg/L).Our result shows an increased level of hs-CRP in GDM as compared to normal pregnant subjects. In this study, we also observed an association of increasing age with elevated level of hs-CRP in GDM. Therefore, hs-CRP can be used as a screening tool for early detection and risk assessment of GDM.", "id": "29302528", "date": null, "title": "The prevalence of elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein in normal pregnancy and gestational diabetes mellitus.", "doi": "10.4103/2249-4863.219995", "journal": ["Journal of family medicine and primary care", "J Family Med Prim Care"]}
