The ability to replicate these asthma traits in the well-established ovalbumin induced chronic model of allergic airways disease is an important tool for asthma research and preclinical drug development. Here, spectra derived from focal plane array and Synchrotron-Fourier transform infrared maps were used to analyse biochemical changes in lung tissue from an ovalbumin-induced murine chronic allergic airways disease model. Analysis of the chemical maps resulted in distinct clusters and significant changes in the lipid and proteins regions of the spectra between the saline control and diseased lung tissue samples. Overall, the utilisation of conventional histological methodologies and Synchrotron infrared microspectroscopy has the ability to expand the characterisation of murine models of asthma.", "id": "29324919", "date": null, "title": "Synchrotron-Fourier transform infrared maps of ovalbumin-induced murine chronic allergic airways disease: Correlation with conventional histology.", "doi": null, "journal": ["Hellenic journal of nuclear medicine", "Hell J Nucl Med"]}
