This fraction was evaluated for its potential to inhibit enzymes such as \u03b1-glucosidase and \u03b1-amylase, in vitro. The fraction was subjected to oral toxicity study followed by in vivo sucrose tolerance test. An analytical high-performance liquid chromatography method was developed for fingerprinting of the fraction.The method adopted for enrichment of saponins was robust enough to enrich saponin content to 96.37% \u00b11.21% w/w. PDSEF displayed superior inhibition of enzymes (\u03b1-glucosidase and \u03b1-amylase with IC50 of 5.12 \u00b1 0.15 \u03bcg/ml and 17.28 \u00b1 0.23 \u03bcg/ml, respectively) compared to acarbose. It was found to be safe in mice up to 2000 mg/kg and significantly prevented blood glucose level in sucrose tolerance test by inhibiting enzymes responsible for hydrolysis of sucrose.PDSEF displayed excellent antihyperglycemic activity in vitro and in vivo and should be evaluated further to develop it as a promising drug for the management of diabetes mellitus.Saponin enriched fraction from P. dulce seeds showed significant inhibition of key enzymes responsible for digestion of polysaccharides. The saponin enriched fraction was found to be safe in mice and prevented blood glucose level in mice in sucrose tolerance test.
