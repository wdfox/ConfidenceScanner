They have been implicated in uremia, diabetes and related complications, including inflammation, retinopathy and nephropathy. This review focused on the formation mechanism, human potential risks and detections of pentosidine and pyrraline and laid the foundation for further study of pentosdine and pyrraline.", "id": "29280151", "date": "2017-12-27", "title": "Review of Pentosidine and Pyrraline in Food and Chemical Models: Formation, Potential Risks and Determination.", "doi": "10.1002/jsfa.8853", "journal": ["Journal of the science of food and agriculture", "J.
