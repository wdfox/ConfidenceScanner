This study aimed to explore the acceptability and feasibility of an in-lab exercise session for YC with T1D. Ten YC ages 3 through7 years with T1D participated in a 20-minute exercise session while wearing blinded continuous glucose monitors and accelerometers. High acceptability was found for participation in the exercise session; high feasibility and acceptability were reported for the assessments. Although most children completed the session, it did not produce moderate to vigorous physical activity. YC were found to spend most of their day sedentary, and they had frequent blood glucose excursions. Findings support the feasibility of conducting a more extensive examination of the relationship among blood glucose levels and physical activity in YC with T1D.", "id": "29290409", "date": "2017-12-29", "title": "Acceptability and Feasibility of Examining Physical Activity in Young Children with Type 1 Diabetes.", "doi": "10.1016/j.pedhc.2017.10.004", "journal": ["Journal of pediatric health care : official publication of National Association of Pediatric Nurse Associates & Practitioners", "J Pediatr Health Care"]}
