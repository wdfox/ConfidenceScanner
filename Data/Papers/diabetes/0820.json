Epidemiological studies have described the prevalence of GDM in the antenatal period, but do not assess the number of women who require pharmacological therapy at term. This information is important for obstetric care providers and health planners. We reviewed indoor charts of all women admitted for delivery at a maternity center in Karnal, Haryana, India. Of the 569 participants, 0.87% had preexisting diabetes, while 1.93% were being treated with drugs for GDM (0.70% insulin, 1.23% metformin). The overall prevalence of diabetes needing drug therapy at time of delivery in pregnant women was 2.81%.", "id": "29285460", "date": null, "title": "Prevalence of Pharamcologically-treated Diabetes in Term Pregnancies in Haryana, India.", "doi": "10.4103/ijem.IJEM_205_17", "journal": ["Indian journal of endocrinology and metabolism", "Indian J Endocrinol Metab"]}
