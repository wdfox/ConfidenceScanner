However, there are no known reports on the relationship between these two clinical parameters. This cross-sectional study aimed to clarify the associations between WBPT and hs-cTnT levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus from the perspective of subclinical myocardial injury or the primary prevention of cardiovascular events.A total of 301 outpatients (men, 116; women, 185; mean age, 65 \u00b1 11 years), with no history of cardiovascular diseases, undergoing treatment for diabetes mellitus were enrolled. Hs-cTnT levels and WBPT were measured using a commercial device, and the relationship between hs-cTnT levels and various clinical parameters, including WBPT, was examined.Hs-cTnT levels were detected in 261 (86.7%) patients. WBPT was significantly higher in patients with detectable hs-cTnT levels than in those with undetectable hs-cTnT levels (64 \u00b1 18 s vs. 51 \u00b1 13 s, P < 0.001). In patients with detectable hs-cTnT levels, there was a significantly positive correlation between WBPT and hs-cTnT levels (r = 0.40; P < 0.001). Furthermore, multiple regression analysis revealed that WBPT (\u03b2 = 0.24; P < 0.001) was an independent variable when hs-cTnT was a subordinate factor. Conversely, patients with high (\u2265 70 s; odds ratio, 5.3 (95% CI, 1.6 - 16.1); P < 0.01) and median (50.2 - 69.8 s; odds ratio, 3.8 (95% CI, 1.2 - 12.4); P < 0.05) WBPT had a significantly higher risk for high hs-cTnT levels (\u2265 0.014 ng/mL) than those with low WBPT (\u2264 50.0 s).The results of this study indicated independent associations of hemorheology with hs-cTnT in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus assessed by MC-FAN. We suggest that an increase in hs-cTnT levels can be prevented by maintaining WBPT at \u2264 50.0 s.", "id": "29317973", "date": "2017-12-22", "title": "Association of Hemorheology With High-Sensitivity Cardiac Troponin T Levels in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Assessed by Microchannel Array Flow Analyzer.", "doi": "10.14740/cr632w", "journal": ["Cardiology research", "Cardiol Res"]}
