This study was conducted to evaluate the alteration of TNF-\u03b1in plasma as well as DRD2 and DRD3 changes in PBMCs of diabetics with severe foot ulcers.Peripheral blood samples were collected from 31 subjects with ulcers, 29 without ulcers, and 25 healthy individuals. Total mRNA was extracted from PBMCs for the study of DRD2, DRD3, and TNF-\u03b1 gene expression variations. Expression patterns of these genes were evaluated by real-time PCR. Consequently, concentration of TNF-\u03b1 was investigated in plasma.Significant decrease in gene expression and plasma concentration of TNF-\u03b1 in PBMCs was observed in both patient groups at P<0.05. These diminutions are correlated to the decrease in the expression of both DRD2 and DRD3 in PBMCs of both patient groups. Also, the same relationship is present between expressions of two new DRD3 transcripts with TNF-\u03b1 downturn.We concluded that DRD2 and DRD3 expression alteration and presence of new DRD3 transcripts can be effective in reduction of TNF-\u03b1 expression as a pro-inflammatory factor. Performing complementary studies, may explain that variations in DRD2 and DRD3 are prognostic and effective markers attributed to the development of diabetes severe foot ulcers.", "id": "29299198", "date": null, "title": "Association of the gene expression variation of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and expressions changes of dopamine receptor genes in progression of diabetic severe foot ulcers.", "doi": "10.22038/IJBMS.2017.9475", "journal": ["Iranian journal of basic medical sciences", "Iran J Basic Med Sci"]}
