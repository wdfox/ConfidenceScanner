Evidence suggests the APOE gene epsilon2/epsilon3/epsilon4 (\u03b52/\u03b53/\u03b54) polymorphisms might be associated with the susceptibility of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, no clear consensus has yet been established. Therefore, the aim of this meta-analysis is to provide a precise conclusion on the potential association between APOE \u03b52/\u03b53/\u03b54 polymorphisms and the risk of CAD in patients with T2DM based on case-control studies. Methods: Pubmed, Embase, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang databases were searched for all relevant studies prior to August 2017 in English and Chinese language. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the strength of the relationships. The between-study heterogeneity was evaluated by Cochran's Q-test and the I2 index to adopt fixed- or random- effect models. Results: A total of 13 studies were eligible for inclusion. There was evidence for significant associations between APOE \u03b54 mutation and the risk of CAD in patients with T2DM (for \u03b53/\u03b54 vs. \u03b53/\u03b53: OR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.38-2.08, P < 0.001; for \u03b54/\u03b54 vs. \u03b53/\u03b53: OR = 2.72, 95% CI = 1.61-4.60, P < 0.001; for \u03b54/\u03b54+\u03b53/\u03b54 vs. \u03b53/\u03b53: OR = 1.83, 95% CI = 1.52-2.22, P < 0.001; for \u03b54 allele vs. \u03b53 allele: OR = 1.64, 95% CI = 1.40-1.94, P < 0.001). In contrast, no significant associations were found in genetic model of APOE \u03b52 mutation (for \u03b52/\u03b52 vs. \u03b53/\u03b53: OR = 1.67, 95% CI = 0.90-3.09, P = 0.104; for \u03b52/\u03b53 vs. \u03b53/\u03b53: OR = 1.18, 95% CI = 0.93-1.51, P = 0.175; for \u03b52/\u03b52+\u03b52/\u03b53 vs. \u03b53/\u03b53: OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 0.88-1.82, P = 0.212; for \u03b52 allele vs. \u03b53 allele: OR = 1.34, 95% CI = 0.98-1.84, P = 0.07). Conclusions: The APOE gene \u03b54 mutation is associated with an increased risk of CAD in patients with T2DM, while the \u03b52 variation has null association with this disease.", "id": "29311965", "date": "2017-12-12", "title": "The Associations between Apolipoprotein E Gene Epsilon2/Epsilon3/Epsilon4 Polymorphisms and the Risk of Coronary Artery Disease in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.", "doi": "10.3389/fphys.2017.01031", "journal": ["Frontiers in physiology", "Front Physiol"]}
