While carbohydrates are present on all cells and pathogens, lectins are also ubiquitous in nature and their interactions with glycans mediate countless biological and physical interactions. Due to the multivalency found in both lectins and their glycan-binding partners, complete characterization of these interactions can be complex and typically requires the use of multiple complimentary techniques. In this chapter, we provide a general strategy and protocols for chemical and biophysical approaches that can be used to characterize carbohydrate-mediated interactions in the context of individual oligosaccharides, as part of a glycoprotein, and ending with visualization of interactions with whole virions.", "id": "29306440", "date": "2017-07-23", "title": "Chemical and Biophysical Approaches for Complete Characterization of Lectin-Carbohydrate Interactions.", "doi": "10.1016/bs.mie.2017.06.010", "journal": ["Methods in enzymology", "Meth.
