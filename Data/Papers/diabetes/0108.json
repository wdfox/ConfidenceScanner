Beta-trace protein gene expression was analyzed by quantitative PCR. Blood samples were collected to establish glucose levels and baseline kidney function. Accuracy was analyzed using ROC curves.Ninety type 2 diabetes mellitus patients and 20 non-diabetic individuals were recruited. The area under the curve was 0.601, sensitivity of 20% and specificity of 89.47%. Among diabetic participants, 18% showed an expression above the cutoff point.These results of accuracy of beta-trace protein gene expression in urine of diabetic patients are promising, although they did not achieve a higher area under the curve level.", "id": "29364366", "date": null, "title": "Urinary beta-trace protein gene expression analysis in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients.", "doi": "10.1590/S1679-45082017AO4012", "journal": ["Einstein (Sao Paulo, Brazil)", "Einstein (Sao Paulo)"]}
