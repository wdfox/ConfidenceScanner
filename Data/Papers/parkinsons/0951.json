Some severe device-related complications have been described in the last few years. Some of them are associated with phytobezoar formation at the pigtail of the catheter. We present the case of a Parkinson disease patient treated with the Duodopa infusion system complicated by jejunal tube fistulization into the colon. We suggest a possible treatment strategy for this complication, which has not been described in the literature to date.", "doi": "10.1159/000452694", "title": "Fistulization of J-PEG Jejunal Tube into the Colon in a Patient Treated with Duodopa\u00ae Infusion: A Case Report.", "journal": ["GE Portuguese journal of gastroenterology", "GE Port J Gastroenterol"]}
