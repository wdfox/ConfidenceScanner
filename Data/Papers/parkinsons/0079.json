Patients were divided into absence of depression (score \u2264 20) and presence of depression (score > 20) based on the assessment of Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Other clinical assessments included Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS), Frontal assessment battery (FAB) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).Patients with depression showed higher proportion of women, longer disease duration, higher UPDRS part III score, higher levodopa equivalent daily doses use, higher occurrences of motor fluctuation and dyskinesia, lower FAB score, and lower MoCA score than those without depression (P < 0.05). The proportions of drinking and overweight/obesity in the depression group were significantly lower than those in the non-depression group (P < 0.05). The forward binary logistic regression model indicated that depression in PD was associated with female sex (OR = 1.376, P = 0.025), higher UPDRS III score (OR = 1.042, P < 0.001), lower FAB score (OR = 0.937, P = 0.015), anxiety (OR = 18.156, P < 0.001), and overweight/obesity (OR = 0.700, P = 0.019), whereas showed no associations with hypertension, diabetes, smoking, drinking, hyperlipidemia, and heart disease.Our study failed to verify vascular depression hypothesis in PD. On the contrary, we demonstrated that overweight/obesity is negatively associated with the presence of depression in PD. This article is protected by copyright.
