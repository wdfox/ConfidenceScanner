There is an urgent, unmet need for neuroprotective or, ideally, neuro-restorative drugs. We describe a 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) zebrafish model to screen drugs for neuroprotective and neuro-restorative capacity. Zebrafish larvae at two days post fertilization were exposed to 6-OHDA for three days, with co-administration of test drugs for neuroprotection experiments, or for 32\u202fh, with subsequent treatment with test drugs for neuro-restoration experiments. Locomotor activity was assessed by automated tracking and dopaminergic neurons were visualized by tyrosine hydroxylase immuno-histochemistry. Exposure to 6-OHDA for either 32\u202fh or 3\u202fdays induced similar, significant locomotor deficits and neuronal loss in 5-day-old larvae. L-DOPA (1\u202fmM) partially restored locomotor activity, but was neither neuroprotective nor neuro-restorative, mirroring the clinical situation. The calcium channel blocker, isradipine (1\u202f\u00b5M) did not prevent or reverse 6-OHDA-induced locomotor deficit or neuronal loss. However, both the tetracycline analog, minocycline (10\u202f\u00b5M), and the monoamine oxidase B inhibitor, rasagiline (1\u202f\u00b5M), prevented the locomotor deficits and neuronal loss due to three-day 6-OHDA exposure. Importantly, they also reversed the locomotor deficit caused by prior exposure to 6-OHDA; rasagiline also reversed neuronal loss and minocycline partially restored neuronal loss due to prior 6-OHDA, making them candidates for investigation as neuro-restorative treatments for Parkinson's disease. Our findings in zebrafish reflect preliminary clinical findings for rasagiline and minocycline. Thus, we have developed a zebrafish model suitable for high-throughput screening of putative neuroprotective and neuro-restorative therapies for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.", "doi": "10.1016/j.neuroscience.2017.10.018", "title": "Neuroprotective and Neuro-restorative Effects of Minocycline and Rasagiline in a Zebrafish 6-Hydroxydopamine Model of Parkinson's Disease.", "journal": ["Neuroscience", "Neuroscience"]}
