PD-related sleep problems (PD-SP), excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and probable REM sleep behaviour disorder (pRBD) were evaluated using the PD sleep scale (PDSS)-2, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and RBD screening questionnaire-Japanese version (RBDSQ-J), respectively.PD-SP (PDSS-2 \u226518; 35.1% vs 7.0%), EDS (ESS \u226510; 37.8% vs 15.5%) and pRBD (RBDSQ-J \u22655; 35.1% vs 7.7%) were more common in patients with PD than in controls. The prevalence of restless legs syndrome did not differ between patients with PD and controls (3.4% vs 2.7%). After adjusting for age, sex, disease duration and Movement Disorder Society-Unified PD Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) part III score, the PIGD group had higher PDSS-2 and ESS scores than the TD group. The RBDSQ-J scores did not differ among the TD, intermediate and PIGD groups. A stepwise regression model predicting the MDS-UPDRS part II score identified the Hoehn and Yahr stage, followed by the number of sleep-related symptoms (PD-SP, EDS and pRBD), disease duration, MDS-UPDRS part III score, PIGD subtype, depression and MDS-UPDRS part IV score as significant predictors.Our study found a significant relationship between sleep disturbances and clinical motor subtypes. An increased number of sleep-related symptoms had an impact on disease-related disability.", "doi": "10.1136/jnnp-2017-316136", "title": "Impact of sleep-related symptoms on clinical motor subtypes and disability in Parkinson's disease: a multicentre cross-sectional study.", "journal": ["Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry", "J.
