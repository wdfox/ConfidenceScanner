The independent effect of STN-DBS on trunk posture was assessed comparing Medication-Off (presurgery) vs Stimulation-On/Medication-Off (post-surgery). The combined effect of STN-DBS plus levodopa was evaluated comparing Medication-On (presurgery) vs Stimulation-On/Medication-On (post-surgery). Analyses were conducted considering both the entire cohort of patients and the subgroup with camptocormia (CMC) and Pisa syndrome (PS).The independent effect of STN-DBS resulted in a 41.4% improvement in abnormal trunk posture severity (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001), with 78.2% of patients (n\u00a0=\u00a079) reporting an improvement of at least 1 point. The combined effect of STN-DBS and levodopa resulted in a 30.9% improvement (P\u00a0=\u00a0.061), with 54.5% of patients (n\u00a0=\u00a055) reporting an improvement of at least 1 point. The subanalysis of patients with CMC (n\u00a0=\u00a023) and PS (n\u00a0=\u00a05) showed a 42.7% improvement in abnormal posture severity when considering the independent effect of STN-DBS (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) and 30.5% when considering the combined effect of STN-DBS and levodopa (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001).STN-DBS may have the potential for improving posture in patients with advanced PD.", "doi": "10.1111/ane.12889", "title": "Subthalamic deep brain stimulation and trunk posture in Parkinson's disease.", "journal": ["Acta neurologica Scandinavica", "Acta Neurol.
