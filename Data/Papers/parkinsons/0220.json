However, the mechanism underlying oxidative stress activates NLRP3 inflammasome remains exclusive. Here we demonstrated cathepsin B (CTSB) as a regulator of the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome by H2O2\u00b7H2O2 induced IL-1\u03b2 secretion in NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent manner\u00b7H2O2 treatment increased CTSB activity, which in turn activated NLRP3 inflammasome, and subsequently processed pro-caspase-1 cleavage into caspase-1, resulting in IL-1 \u03b2 secretion. Genetic inhibition or pharmacological inhibition of CTSB blocked the cleavage of pro-caspase-1 into caspase-1 and subsequent IL-1 \u03b2 secretion induced by H2O2. Importantly, CTSB activity, IL-1\u03b2 levels and malondialdehyde (MDA) were remarkably elevated in plasma of AD patients compared to healthy controls, while glutathione was significantly lower than healthy controls. Correlation analyses showed that CTSB activity was positively correlated with IL-1\u03b2 and MDA levels, but negatively correlated with GSH levels in plasma of AD patients. Taken together, our results indicate that oxidative stress activates NLRP3 through upregulating CTSB activity. Our results identify an important biological function of CTSB in neuroinflammation, suggesting that CTSB is a potential target in AD therapy.", "doi": "10.1016/j.yexcr.2017.11.015", "title": "Cathepsin B links oxidative stress to the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome.", "journal": ["Experimental cell research", "Exp.
