We outline ethical arguments and provide pragmatic recommendations to assist neuropsychologists working in movement disorder teams.The goals of the pre-operative neuropsychological DBS assessment include: (1) identification of potential cognitive risk factors; (2) identification of relevant neuropsychiatric or neurobehavioral factors; (3) assessment of level of family support; and (4) systematic assessment of patient's and family member's goals or expectations for DBS. The information gleaned from the pre-operative neuropsychological assessment is highly relevant to the most commonly studied clinical ethics challenges encountered in DBS: (1) assessment of risk/benefit; (2) determinations regarding inclusion/exclusion; (3) autonomy; and (4) patient's perception of benefit and quality of life.Neuropsychologists are particularly well poised to provide unique and important insights to assist with developing the most ethically sound practices that take into account patient's values as well as fiduciary responsibilities to the patient, the team, the profession, and the broader community.", "doi": "10.1093/arclin/acx088", "title": "Clinical Ethics in the Context of Deep Brain Stimulation for Movement Disorders.", "journal": ["Archives of clinical neuropsychology : the official journal of the National Academy of Neuropsychologists", "Arch Clin Neuropsychol"]}
