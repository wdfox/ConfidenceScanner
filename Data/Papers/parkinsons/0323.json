Although exits of cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson disease, are completely opposite, there are some common points of view between both diseases, including growth and death signaling pathways, and oxidative stresses affect the onset and pathogenesis of both cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. DJ-1 has versatile functions and plays a role in protection against oxidative stress. Inactivation and/or excess activation of DJ-1 functions, therefore, leads to onsets of oxidative stress-related diseases such as type 2 diabetes and male infertility in addition to cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, and studies about DJ-1 will give rise to the common mechanism among these diseases. Furthermore, secreted DJ-1 levels in serum and DJ-1-binding compounds will be a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic drug for neurodegenerative diseases, respectively.", "doi": "10.1007/978-981-10-6583-5_1", "title": "Introduction/Overview.", "journal": ["Advances in experimental medicine and biology", "Adv.
