Dietary intake of \u00df-carotene was associated with a lower risk of PD (hazard ratio: 0.86; 95% confidence interval: 0.78-0.95; Ptrend \u2009<\u20090.01 for women and hazard ratio: 0.91; 95% confidence interval: 0.84-0.99; Ptrend \u2009=\u20090.05 for men). An inverse association between dietary vitamin E and PD risk was found in women (hazard ratio: 0.87; 95% confidence interval: 0.79-0.96; Ptrend \u2009=\u20090.02). Dietary intake of vitamin C was inversely associated with PD risk in women at borderline significance (hazard ratio: 0.91; 95% confidence interval: 0.83-1.00; Ptrend \u2009=\u20090.04). There was no association between dietary total antioxidant capacity and PD risk in either women (hazard ratio: 0.93; 95% confidence interval: 0.84-1.02; Ptrend \u2009=\u20090.35) or men (hazard ratio: 1.00; 95% confidence interval: 0.93-1.07; Ptrend \u2009=\u20090.97).Intake of dietary vitamin E and \u00df-carotene was associated with a lower risk of PD. \u00a9 2017 The Authors.
