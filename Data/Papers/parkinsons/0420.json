However, multifaceted and divergent signaling cascades downstream of oxidative stress have posed challenges for researchers to identify a central component of the oxidative stress-induced pathways causing neurodegeneration in PD. Since 2010, c-Abl-a non-receptor tyrosine kinase and an indicator of oxidative stress-has shown remarkable potential as a future promising drug target in PD therapeutics. Although, the constitutively active form of c-Abl, Bcr-Abl, has a long history in chronic myeloid leukemia and acute lymphocytic leukemia, the role of c-Abl in PD and relevant neurodegenerative diseases was completely unknown. Recently, others and we have identified and validated c-Abl as an important pathogenic mediator of the disease, where activated c-Abl emerges as a common link to various PD-related inducers of oxidative stress relevant to both sporadic and familial forms of PD and \u03b1-synucleinopathies. This review discusses the role of c-Abl in PD and the latest advancement on c-Abl as a drug target and as a prospective biomarker.", "doi": "10.3233/JPD-171191", "title": "c-Abl and Parkinson's Disease: Mechanisms and Therapeutic Potential.", "journal": ["Journal of Parkinson's disease", "J Parkinsons Dis"]}
