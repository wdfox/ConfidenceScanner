Descriptive statistics were performed and a linear regression model was built to analyse determinants of informal care time.2047 patients (female: 58%) with mean age of 58.9 (SD = 16.3) years and EQ-5D-3L index score of 0.64 (SD = 0.33) were involved. 27% received informal care, the average time of care was 7.54 (SD = 26.36) hours/week. Both the rate of informal care use and its time differed significantly between the diagnoses (p<0.05), the highest were in dementia, Parkinsons' disease and in chronic inflammatory immunological diseases. Significant determinants were age, EQ-5D-3L scores, gender and certain diagnosis dummys (R2 = 0.111).Informal care use is significant in chronic debilitating conditions. Future studies are encouraged to reveal unmet needs, preferences and further explanatory factors.
