We synthesized 4-(benzyloxy)phenyl and biphenyl-4-yl derivatives including halogen substituents on the terminal aryl unit. In addition, we modified the carbon linker between amine group and the biaryl linked unit. Among synthesized compounds, 12c exhibited the most potent and selective MAO-B inhibitory effect (hMAO-B IC50: 8.9\u202fnM; >10,000-fold selectivity over MAO-A) as a competitive inhibitor. In addition, 12c showed greater MAO-B inhibitory activity and selectivity compared to well-known MAO-B inhibitors such as selegiline, safinamide and sembragiline. In the MPTP-induced mouse model of Parkinson's disease (PD), 12c significantly protected the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-immunopositive DAergic neurons and attenuated the PD-associated behavioral deficits. This study suggests characteristic structures as a MAO-B inhibitor that may provide a good insight for the development of therapeutic agents for PD.", "doi": "10.1016/j.bmc.2017.11.036", "title": "Synthesis and evaluation of biaryl derivatives for structural characterization of selective monoamine oxidase B inhibitors toward Parkinson's disease therapy.", "journal": ["Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry", "Bioorg.
