Although the self-assembly of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1S) into oligomers and amyloid fibrils is well established, the aggregation propensity of other members of the family and their role in disease is still under debate. Moriarty et al. now suggest that the pH switching that occurs between different cellular environments could control \u03b2-synuclein (\u03b2S) aggregation via altering its charge distribution, thus opening new possible roles for \u03b2S in Parkinson's and other neurodegenerative diseases.", "doi": "10.1074/jbc.H117.780528", "title": "Getting in charge of \u03b2-synuclein fibrillation.", "journal": ["The Journal of biological chemistry", "J.
