Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the genes APOE, cystatin C (CST), and membrane metalloendopeptidase (MME) were evaluated in relation to demographic variables, clinical phenotypes, and CSF A\u03b21-42 levels using a cross-sectional approach.Risk variants in the genes APOE and CST were associated with lower CSF A\u03b21-42 levels. Clinically, patients with 2 risk alleles in CST tended to show a shorter interval from age at onset of PD to age at onset of dementia.This study suggests that genetic variants associated with A\u03b2 clearance are involved in the pathogenesis of dementia in PD and possibly influence the onset of dementia.", "doi": "10.1212/WNL.0000000000004705", "title": "SNPs in A\u03b2 clearance proteins: Lower CSF A\u03b21-42 levels and earlier onset of dementia in PD.", "journal": ["Neurology", "Neurology"]}
