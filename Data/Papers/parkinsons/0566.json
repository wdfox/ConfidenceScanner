The biosensor was constructed by one-step electrochemical deposition of a nanocomposite in aqueous solution at pH 7.0, consisting of molybdenum disulfide, multi-walled carbon nanotubes, and polypyrrole. A series of analytical methods was performed to investigate the surface characteristics and the improved electrocatalytic effect of the nanocomposite, including cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. The constructed biosensor showed high sensitivity (1.130\u00a0\u03bcA\u03bcM-1cm-2) with a dynamic linearity range of 25-1000\u00a0nM and a detection limit of 10\u00a0nM. Additionally, the designed sensor exhibited strong anti-interference ability and satisfactory reproducibility. The practical application of the sensor was manifested for the ex\u00a0vivo determination of dopamine neurotransmitters using brain tissue samples of a mouse Parkinson's disease model.", "doi": "10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.10.059", "title": "One-step construction of a molybdenum disulfide/multi-walled carbon nanotubes/polypyrrole nanocomposite biosensor for the ex-vivo detection of dopamine in mouse brain tissue.", "journal": ["Biochemical and biophysical research communications", "Biochem.
