Recently, in addition to constipation, a diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) was also found to be associated with increased PD risk. Gut microbiota alterations have been reported in IBS and recently also in PD. IBS-like bowel symptoms in PD and their possible connection to other non-motor symptoms and faecal microbiota were assessed.This case-control study compared 74 PD patients with 75 controls without any signs of parkinsonism or potential premotor symptoms. IBS-like symptoms were assessed using the Rome III questionnaire. The non-motor symptoms were assessed using the Non-Motor Symptoms Questionnaire and Non-Motor Symptom Scale. Faecal microbiota were assessed by pyrosequencing of the V1-V3 regions of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene.Symptoms that were IBS-like were significantly more prevalent in PD patients than in controls (24.3% vs. 5.3%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.001). Criteria for functional constipation were met by 12.2% of PD patients and 6.7% of controls (P\u00a0=\u00a00.072).\u00a0PD patients with IBS-like symptoms had more non-motor symptoms and a lower faecal abundance of Prevotella bacteria than those without IBS-like symptoms.Our results indicate that PD patients may suffer from colonic dysfunction beyond pure constipation. Therefore, a more comprehensive assessment of bowel symptoms could provide valuable information. The lower abundance of Prevotella bacteria in PD patients with IBS-like symptoms suggests that the microbiota-gut-brain axis may be implicated in the gastrointestinal dysfunction of PD patients.", "doi": "10.1111/ene.13398", "title": "More than constipation - bowel symptoms in Parkinson's disease and their connection to gut microbiota.", "journal": ["European journal of neurology", "Eur.
