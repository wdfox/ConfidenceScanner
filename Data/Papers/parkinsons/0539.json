Neuroinflammation, neurotrophic factors and neuronal recovery factors associated with the neuroprotective effect of this flavonoid require further investigations. Thus, now we investigated the possible involvement of inflammatory cytokines, neurotrophic factors and neuronal recovery in the effect of chrysin in 6-hydroxidopamine (6-OHDA), a well-established model of Parkinson's disease, in striatum of mice. The 6-OHDA microinjection induced behavioral alterations on the rotarod test and apomorphine-induced circling behavior in mice. 6-OHDA administration elevated levels of tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1, interferon-gamma, interleukin-1\u03b2, interleukin-2, interleukin-6 and nuclear factor-kappa B and decreased the interleukin-10 levels, total reactive antioxidant potential and total antioxidant reactivity in striatum, as well as, modified the calcium-binding protein B (S100B), brain-derived neurotrophic factor, nerve growth factor and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor levels. The intrastriatal injection of 6-OHDA also induced an decrease of dopamine, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, homovanylic acid levels and tyrosine hydroxylase content. Oral treatment with chrysin (10\u00a0mg/kg, 28 days), culminated with the prevention of these alterations occasioned by 6-OHDA. These results corroborated with the neuroprotective effect of chrysin in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and, indicated the mechanism involved throught the inflammatory cytokines, neurotrophic factors and recovery of dopaminergic neurons in striatum.", "doi": "10.1016/j.cbi.2017.10.019", "title": "Protective role of chrysin on 6-hydroxydopamine-induced neurodegeneration a mouse model of Parkinson's disease: Involvement of neuroinflammation and neurotrophins.", "journal": ["Chemico-biological interactions", "Chem.
