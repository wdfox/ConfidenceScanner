Hence, the search for alternative therapeutic choices based on continuous dopaminergic stimulation (CDS) becomes crucial for the treatment of advanced PD. Here, we describe the case of a 70-year-old man with a 9-year history of PD, treated with daytime levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) and overnight Rotigotine transdermal patch. LCIG monotherapy significantly reduced motor fluctuations and prevented the appearance of unpredictable off periods; concurrently, overnight Rotigotine improved his sleep quality and morning akinesia. Both LCIG and Rotigotine induce CDS, which conceptually mimics physiologic striatal dopamine receptor function. Hence, they both represent a good therapeutic option for the treatment of advanced PD.", "doi": null, "title": "Continuous dopaminergic stimulation in a patient treated with daytime Levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel and overnight Rotigotine: a case report.", "journal": ["Acta bio-medica : Atenei Parmensis", "Acta Biomed"]}
