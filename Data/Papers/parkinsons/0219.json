The autophagy-lysosome pathway (ALP) is responsible for the high capacity clearance of \u03b1-syn. ALP dysfunction is documented in PD and pre-clinical evidence suggests that inhibiting the ALP promotes the pathological accumulation of \u03b1-syn. We previously identified the pathological accumulation of \u03b1-syn in the brains of mice deficient for the soluble lysosomal enzyme alpha-Galactosidase A (\u03b1-Gal A), a member of the glycosphingolipid metabolism pathway. In the present study, we quantified \u03b1-Gal A activity and levels of its glycosphingolipid metabolites in postmortem temporal cortex specimens from control individuals and in PD individuals staged with respect to \u03b1-syn containing Lewy body pathology. In late-state PD temporal cortex we observed significant decreases in \u03b1-Gal A activity and the 46kDa \"active\" species of \u03b1-Gal A as determined respectively by fluorometric activity assay and western blot analysis. These decreases in \u03b1-Gal A activity/levels correlated significantly with increased \u03b1-syn phosphorylated at serine 129 (p129S-\u03b1-syn) that was maximal in late-stage PD temporal cortex. Mass spectrometric analysis of 29 different isoforms of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), a substrate of \u03b1-Gal A indicated no significant differences with respect to different stages of PD temporal cortex. However, significant correlations were observed between increased levels of several Gb3 isoforms and with decreased \u03b1-Gal A activity and/or increased p129S-\u03b1-syn. Deacylated Gb3 (globotriaosylsphingosine or lyso-Gb3) was also analyzed in PD brain tissue but was below the limit of detection of 20pmol/g. Analysis of other lysosomal enzymes revealed a significant decrease in activity for the lysosomal aspartic acid protease cathepsin D but not for glucocerebrosidase (GCase) or cathepsin B in late-stage PD temporal cortex. However, a significant correlation was observed between decreasing GCase activity and increasing p129S-\u03b1-syn. Together our findings indicate \u03b1-Gal A deficiency in late-stage PD brain that correlates significantly with the pathological accumulation of \u03b1-syn, and further suggest the potential for \u03b1-Gal A and its glycosphingolipid substrates as putative biomarkers for PD.", "doi": "10.1016/j.nbd.2017.11.006", "title": "The lysosomal enzyme alpha-Galactosidase A is deficient in Parkinson's disease brain in association with the pathologic accumulation of alpha-synuclein.", "journal": ["Neurobiology of disease", "Neurobiol.
