Pharmacotherapy studies in the literature addressing insomnia in PD reveal disappointing and inconsistent results. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a novel treatment option with durable effects shown in primary insomnia. However, the lack of accessibility and expense can be limiting. For these reasons, computerized CBT for insomnia (CCBT-I) has been developed. The CCBT-I program is a 6-week web-based course consisting of daily \"lessons\" providing learnable skills and appropriate recommendations to help patients improve their sleep habits and patterns.We conducted a single-center, pilot, randomized controlled trial comparing CCBT-I versus standardized sleep hygiene instructions to treat insomnia in PD. Twenty-eight subjects with PD experiencing insomnia, with a score\u00a0>\u00a011 on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) were recruited. Based on a 6-point improvement in ISI in treatment group when compared to controls and an alpha\u00a0=\u00a00.05 and beta of 0.1 (power\u00a0=\u00a090%) a sample size of 11 patients (on active treatment) were required to detect this treatment effect using a dependent sample t-test.In total, 8/14 (57%) subjects randomized to CCBT-I versus 13/14 (93%) subjects randomized to standard education completed the study. Among completers, the improvement in ISI scores was greater with CCBT-I as compared to standard education (-7.9 vs -3.5; p\u00a0=\u00a00.03). However, in an intention-to-treat analysis, where all enrolled subjects were included, the change in ISI between groups was not significant (-.4.5 vs -3.3; p\u00a0=\u00a00.48), likely due to the high dropout rate in the CCBT-I group (43%).This pilot study suggests that CCBT-I can be an effective treatment option for PD patients with insomnia when the course is thoroughly completed. High drop-out rate in our study shows that although effective, it may not be a generalizable option; however, larger studies are needed for further evaluation.", "doi": "10.1186/s40734-017-0062-2", "title": "A Computerized Cognitive behavioral therapy Randomized, Controlled, pilot trial for insomnia in Parkinson Disease (ACCORD-PD).", "journal": ["Journal of clinical movement disorders", "J Clin Mov Disord"]}
