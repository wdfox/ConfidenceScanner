Dopaminergic medications may significantly impact DAT availability and thus uptake of DAT tracers. A patient had a false-positive DAT-SPECT while on dextroamphetamine/amphetamine for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. DAT-SPECT normalized after withholding amphetamine therapy. This report demonstrates that an accurate medication history combined with the knowledge of drugs that interfere with DAT imaging is critical to ensure accuracy.", "doi": "10.2967/jnmt.117.201558", "title": "False-Positive Dopamine Transporter Imaging Due to Therapeutic Dextroamphetamine/Amphetamine.", "journal": ["Journal of nuclear medicine technology", "J Nucl Med Technol"]}
