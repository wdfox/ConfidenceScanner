Many studies have pointed out the importance of both systems in the pain descending modulatory system and in pain-related symptoms in some chronic disorders, e.g. Parkinson disease and fibromyalgia. The interaction between oxytocin and dopamine systems has been addressed in some motivational behaviors, e.g. maternal and sexual behaviors, pair bonding, and salience. In this aspect, we propose that an oxytocin-dopamine interaction could be present in nociception, and we also explain the possible hypotheses of such an interaction between these systems.", "doi": "10.1515/revneuro-2017-0068", "title": "Role of central oxytocin and dopamine systems in nociception and their possible interactions: suggested hypotheses.", "journal": ["Reviews in the neurosciences", "Rev Neurosci"]}
