Of all PwD excluding the infective group (n = 1,777), 63% were men, 39% were from rural areas, 87% had behavioral abnormalities along with cognitive deficits, and 73% had impaired ADLs. Among dementia subtypes, a positive family history, cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors, and behavioral abnormalities were found to be distributed. However, there existed a predominance of specific behavioral pattern in each subtype. The mean duration of follow-up varied from 2.9 \u00b1 2.3 (VaD) to 3.6 \u00b1 2.1 (AD) and greater than 30% were found to be stable on treatment (except in dementia with Lewy body).This large hospital-based study provides a distribution pattern and clinical spectrum of dementia subtypes in a North Indian population.", "doi": "10.1159/000478978", "title": "Clinical Spectrum, Risk Factors, and Behavioral Abnormalities among Dementia Subtypes in a North Indian Population: A Hospital-Based Study.", "journal": ["Dementia and geriatric cognitive disorders extra", "Dement Geriatr Cogn Dis Extra"]}
