Power in several frequency bands was estimated and used as input to Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) which classified short data segments as either tremor-free rest or rest tremor. HMMs were compared to direct threshold application to individual power features.Applying a threshold directly to band-limited power was insufficient for tremor detection (mean area under the curve [AUC] of receiver operating characteristic: 0.64, STD: 0.19). Multi-feature HMMs, in contrast, allowed for accurate detection (mean AUC: 0.82, STD: 0.15), using four power features obtained from a single contact pair. Within-patient training yielded better accuracy than across-patient training (0.84vs. 0.78, p=0.03), yet tremor could often be detected accurately with either approach. High frequency oscillations (>200Hz) were the best performing individual feature.LFP-based markers of tremor are robust enough to allow for accurate tremor detection in short data segments, provided that appropriate statistical models are used.LFP-based markers of tremor could be useful control signals for closed-loop deep brain stimulation.", "doi": "10.1016/j.clinph.2017.07.419", "title": "Parkinsonian rest tremor can be detected accurately based on neuronal oscillations recorded from the subthalamic nucleus.", "journal": ["Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "Clin Neurophysiol"]}
