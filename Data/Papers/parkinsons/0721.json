Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) was approved by the FDA in 2002 as neuromodulation therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease, prompting several randomized controlled trials that confirmed its safety and effectiveness. The implantation of tens of thousands of patients in North America and Europe ignited research into its potential role in early disease stages and the therapeutic benefit of DBS compared to best medical therapy. In 2013 the EARLY-STIM trial provided Class I evidence for the use of DBS earlier in Parkinson's disease. This finding led to the most recent FDA approval in patients with at least 4 years of disease duration and 4 months of motor complications as an adjunct therapy for patients not adequately controlled with medications. This following review highlights the historical development and advances made overtime in DBS implantation, the current application, and the challenges that come with it.", "doi": "10.1155/2017/9358153", "title": "Earlier Intervention with Deep Brain Stimulation for Parkinson's Disease.", "journal": ["Parkinson's disease", "Parkinsons Dis"]}
