The 39-item Parkinson's disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) is the most widely used PD-specific health-related quality-of-life questionnaire. The short-form 8-item Parkinson's disease Questionnaire (PDQ-8) was found to produce results similar to that of the PDQ-39 cross-culturally. However, there is no evaluation of the PDQ-8 in the mainland of China.In this longitudinal study, 283 patients with Parkinson's disease were recruited. The PDQ-39, the PDQ-8 and other scales were administered. Patients attended the clinic once annually for three years to complete the scales.The PDQ-8 was found to have good validity and reliability. There was a strong correlation between the summary indices of the PDQ-8 and the PDQ-39 (r=0.93, P<0.001). Results suggested that the PDQ-8 was also associated with other clinical scales of mobility, depression and cognition. The convergent validity and discriminant validity of the PDQ-8 were demonstrated by item-to-dimension correlations. There was acceptable internal consistency of the PDQ-8 (Cronbach's \u03b1: 0.80; Item-scale correlation efficient: 0.56-0.72). The PDQ-8 replicated the results of the PDQ-39 well at all follow-up time points (intraclass correlation coefficient: 0.96-0.98). In addition, there was good test-retest reliability of the PDQ-8.The PDQ-8 is a valid and reliable instrument assessing health-related quality of life for PD patients in the mainland of China.", "doi": "10.1186/s12955-017-0742-5", "title": "Evaluation of PDQ-8 and its relationship with PDQ-39 in China: a three-year longitudinal study.", "journal": ["Health and quality of life outcomes", "Health Qual Life Outcomes"]}
