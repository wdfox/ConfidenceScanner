PD pathology is related to depleted dopamine levels, \u03b1-synuclein aggregation, and death of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. Reports have suggested central and peripheral inflammation in the prodromal stage of the disease, which is sustained during disease progression. Alongside the activation of peripheral immune system exacerbates the dissonant central inflammatory responses and could contribute in synergistic neurodegeneration. Activated glial cells contribute significantly in the neuroinflammatory process during the occurrence of the disease and are also acknowledged as a hallmark of disease progression. However, the contribution of glial cells is not well defined in the context of neurodegeneration and neuroprotection. This review provides an overview of the roles of immune and inflammatory responses and their consequences in PD disease pathogenesis and also discusses possible therapeutic strategies for PD based on these findings.", "doi": "10.1002/jnr.24185", "title": "Updates on immunity and inflammation in Parkinson disease pathology.", "journal": ["Journal of neuroscience research", "J.
