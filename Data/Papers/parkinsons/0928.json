Using an unbiased screen targeting endogenous gene expression, we discovered that the \u03b22-adrenoreceptor (\u03b22AR) is a regulator of the \u03b1-synuclein gene (SNCA). \u03b22AR ligands modulate SNCA transcription through histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation of its promoter and enhancers. Over 11 years of follow-up in 4 million Norwegians, the \u03b22AR agonist salbutamol, a brain-penetrant asthma medication, was associated with reduced risk of developing PD (rate ratio, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.58 to 0.76). Conversely, a \u03b22AR antagonist correlated with increased risk. \u03b22AR activation protected model mice and patient-derived cells. Thus, \u03b22AR is linked to transcription of \u03b1-synuclein and risk of PD in a ligand-specific fashion and constitutes a potential target for therapies.", "doi": "10.1126/science.aaf3934", "title": "\u03b22-Adrenoreceptor is a regulator of the \u03b1-synuclein gene driving risk of Parkinson's disease.", "journal": ["Science (New York, N.Y.)", "Science"]}
