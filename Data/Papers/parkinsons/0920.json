We detect up-regulation in DDRs level in post-mortem Alzheimer and Parkinson brains. Lentiviral shRNA knockdown of DDR1 and DDR2 reduces the levels of \u03b1-synuclein, tau, and \u03b2-amyloid and prevents cell loss in vivo and in vitro. DDR1 and DDR2 knockdown alters brain immunity and significantly reduces the level of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM)-2 and microglia. These studies suggest that DDR1 and DDR2 inhibition is a potential target to clear neurotoxic proteins and reduce inflammation in neurodegeneration.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jneuroim.2017.07.009", "title": "Discoidin domain receptor inhibition reduces neuropathology and attenuates inflammation in neurodegeneration models.", "journal": ["Journal of neuroimmunology", "J.
