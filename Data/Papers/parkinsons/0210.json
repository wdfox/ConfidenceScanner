Mutant \u03b1-syn expression increases the vulnerability of neurons to exogenous insults. In this study, we developed a new PD model in the transgenic mice expressing mutant hemizygous (hemi) or homozygous (homo) A53T \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn Tg) and their wildtype (WT) littermates by treatment with sub-toxic (10 mg/kg, i.p., daily for 5 days) or toxic (30 mg/kg, i.p., daily for 5 days) dose of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Tyrosine hydroxylase and Bcl-2 levels were reduced in the \u03b1-syn Tg but not WT mice by sub-toxic MPTP injection. In the adhesive removal test, time to remove paper was significantly increased only in the homo \u03b1-syn Tg mice. In the challenging beam test, the hemi and homo \u03b1-syn Tg mice spent significantly longer time to traverse as compared to that of WT group. In order to find out responsible proteins related with vulnerability of mutant \u03b1-syn expressed neurons, DJ-1 and ubiquitin enzyme expressions were examined. In the SN, DJ-1 and ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, UBE2N, levels were significantly decreased in the \u03b1-syn Tg mice. Moreover, A53T \u03b1-syn overexpression decreased DJ-1 expression in SH-SY5Y cells. These findings suggest that the vulnerability to oxidative injury such as MPTP of A53T \u03b1-syn mice can be explained by downregulation of DJ-1.", "doi": "10.4196/kjpp.2017.21.6.625", "title": "MPTP-induced vulnerability of dopamine neurons in A53T \u03b1-synuclein overexpressed mice with the potential involvement of DJ-1 downregulation.", "journal": ["The Korean journal of physiology & pharmacology : official journal of the Korean Physiological Society and the Korean Society of Pharmacology", "Korean J.
