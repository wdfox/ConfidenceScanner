Dementia or PD was compared within 90 and 180 days and 1 to 4 years preceding and subsequent to the date of diagnosis in interRAI-HC. Consistency was measured through sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), weighted kappa (\u03ba), and McNemar test.For a diagnosis within 90 days, dementia showed 60.77% sensitivity, 95.33% specificity, 68.46% PPV, and 93.58% NPV. The PD showed 65.74% sensitivity, 99.52% specificity, 80.43% PPV, and 98.98% NPV. \u03ba for dementia (\u03ba = 0.59), PD (\u03ba = 0.720), and McNemar test was significant ( P < .001) for all lengths of follow-up.Substantial agreement between multiple sources of health data can be a valuable resource for decision-making in older people with neurological conditions.", "doi": "10.1177/0891988717732154", "title": "Evaluation of the National Minimum Data Set for Neurological Conditions in Older Adults.", "journal": ["Journal of geriatric psychiatry and neurology", "J Geriatr Psychiatry Neurol"]}
