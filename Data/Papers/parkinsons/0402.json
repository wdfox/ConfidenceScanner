Classic CSF biomarkers (amyloid-beta - A\u03b242, tau protein - \u03c4T and phosphorylated tau protein - \u03c4P-181) are established biomarkers in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). CSF a-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) has emerged as a promising biomarker in patients with Parkinsonism. The aim of this study was to analyze the CSF biochemical profile of patients with Parkinsonism.We analyzed the CSF biomarker profile (A\u03b242, \u03c4T, \u03c4P-181, \u03b1-syn) and all relevant ratios in 68 patients with Parkinsonism (19 PSP, 15 MSA, 17 CBD, 17 PD) and 18 controls, diagnosed by latest established diagnostic criteria.CBD patients exhibited elevated \u03c4T and decreased A\u03b242 compared to the other groups. Five CBD, one PSP patient and one control had a typical AD CSF profile. After exclusion of these patients, the \u03c4T/A\u03b242 ratio was significantly elevated in MSA patients compared to PD patients and provided excellent specificity and adequate sensitivity in their differential diagnosis.CSF biochemical profile analysis is important in distinguishing AD patients with a CBS phenotype from non-AD CBS patients. The \u03c4T/A\u03b242 ratio is useful in the differential diagnosis of MSA from PD.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jns.2017.09.039", "title": "CSF biomarkers \u03b2-amyloid, tau proteins and a-synuclein in the differential diagnosis of Parkinson-plus syndromes.", "journal": ["Journal of the neurological sciences", "J.
