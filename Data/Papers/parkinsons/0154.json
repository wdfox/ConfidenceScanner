Many studies have suggested that L-DOPA neurotoxicity and LID are associated with glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) activation. Areas covered: LID is caused by striatal dopamine (DA) denervation in PD and pulsatile L-DOPA treatment. These factors lead to dysregulated DA transmission, abnormal intracellular signaling and transcription factors in striatal neurons, and altered gene expression and plasticity at corticostriatal synapses. The mechanisms of L-DOPA toxicity involve oxidative stress, L-DOPA oxidation to quinone, mitochondrial dysfunction, and \u03b1-synuclein. GSK-3 has been suggested to play key roles in all the mechanisms associated of L-DOPA toxicity and LID in PD. Expert opinion: GSK-3 plays critical roles in L-DOPA-induced neurotoxicity, and the development of specific methods to inhibit GSK-3 function may help prevent L-DOPA neurotoxicity and LID in PD. However, balanced GSK-3 inhibition and less \u03b2-catenin degradation is essential for preventing LID, because too much GSK-3 inhibition increases \u03b2-catenin levels, which is related to cancers.", "doi": "10.1080/17425255.2018.1417387", "title": "Understanding the role of glycogen synthase kinase-3 in L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease.", "journal": ["Expert opinion on drug metabolism & toxicology", "Expert Opin Drug Metab Toxicol"]}
