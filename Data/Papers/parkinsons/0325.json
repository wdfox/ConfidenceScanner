Specific attention was paid to the association between PADLS and PD severity, according to the Hoehn & Yahr (H&Y) staging.The sample included 251 persons with PD (mean age 70 [SD 9] years). Data collection comprised a self-administered postal survey, structured interviews, and clinical assessments at home visits.Data completeness was 99.6% and the mean PADLS score was 2.1. Floor and ceiling effects were 22% and 2%, respectively. PADLS scores were more strongly associated (rs > 0.5) with perceived functional independence, ADL dependency, walking difficulties, and self-rated PD severity than with variables such as PD duration and cognitive function (rs < 0.5). PADLS scores differed across H&Y stages (Kruskal-Wallis test, p < 0.001). Those in H&Y stages IV-V had more ADL disability than those in stage III (Mann-Whitney U test, p < 0.001), whereas there were no significant differences between the other stages.PADLS revealed excellent data completeness, acceptable targeting, and external construct validity. It seems to be well suited as a rough estimate of ADL disability in people with PD.", "doi": "10.1155/2017/4151738", "title": "Psychometric Evaluation of the Parkinson's Disease Activities of Daily Living Scale.", "journal": ["Parkinson's disease", "Parkinsons Dis"]}
