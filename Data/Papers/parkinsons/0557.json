Prescriptions were analyzed and awareness was evaluated using a questionnaire.The mean number of anti-Parkinson agents (APA) prescribed was 1.52\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.65. Number of APA strongly correlated with disease duration (\u03c1 =\u00a00.818; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Many APA were underutilized (prescribed daily dose/defined daily dose < 1). There was no awareness of all items on symptoms and alternative therapeutic options. Awareness of disease impairments (32%), long-term complications (28%), dosing regimen (46%) and follow-up (36%) was poor.More than one APA is commonly prescribed in PD patients. Awareness of disease and treatment of PD is poor among the patients.", "doi": "10.2217/nmt-2017-0020", "title": "Prescription pattern and awareness of disease and treatment in patients of Parkinson's disease.", "journal": ["Neurodegenerative disease management", "Neurodegener Dis Manag"]}
