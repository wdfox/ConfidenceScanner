By using solution and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance techniques in conjunction with other structural methods, we identified the fundamental characteristics that enable toxic \u03b1-synuclein oligomers to perturb biological membranes and disrupt cellular function; these include a highly lipophilic element that promotes strong membrane interactions and a structured region that inserts into lipid bilayers and disrupts their integrity. In support of these conclusions, mutations that target the region that promotes strong membrane interactions by \u03b1-synuclein oligomers suppressed their toxicity in neuroblastoma cells and primary cortical neurons.", "doi": "10.1126/science.aan6160", "title": "Structural basis of membrane disruption and cellular toxicity by \u03b1-synuclein oligomers.", "journal": ["Science (New York, N.Y.)", "Science"]}
