Cumulative average exposure to various size fractions of PM [PM10 (\u226410\u03bcm microns in diameter), PM2.5 (\u22642.5\u03bcm in diameter), and PM2.5-10 (between 2.5 and 10\u03bcm in diameter)] up to 2 years before the onset of PD was estimated using a spatiotemporal model by linking each participant's place of residence throughout the study with location-specific PM levels. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards models to independently estimate the risk of PD associated with each size fraction of PM.In models adjusted for age, smoking, region, and population density, we did not observe statistically significant associations between exposure to PM and PD risk. In analyses considering cumulative average PM exposure, the comparing the top to the bottom quintile of PM exposure was 0.85 [95% confidence interval (CI): (0.63, 1.15)] for PM10, 0.97 [95% CI: (0.72, 1.32)] for PM2.5, and 0.88 [95% CI: (0.64, 1.22)] for hazard ratio (HR) PM2.5-10. The results did not change markedly when restricted to men who did not move during the study or when stratified by smoking status or population density.In this study, we found no evidence that exposure to air pollution is a risk factor for PD in men. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP259.", "doi": "10.1289/EHP259", "title": "Air Pollution and Risk of Parkinson's Disease in a Large Prospective Study of Men.", "journal": ["Environmental health perspectives", "Environ.
