In 1998, multiple system atrophy joined Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies as the third major synucleinopathy. Here, we describe the work that led to the identification of \u03b1-synuclein in Lewy bodies, Lewy neurites and Papp-Lantos bodies. We also review some of the findings reported since 1997.", "doi": "10.1007/s00441-017-2706-9", "title": "Neurodegeneration and the ordered assembly of \u03b1-synuclein.", "journal": ["Cell and tissue research", "Cell Tissue Res."]}
