Rational molecular design, target recognition and predicted pharmacokinetic properties have been evaluated by means of molecular modelling. Based on these properties, compounds were synthesized and evaluated in\u00a0vitro as MAO-B and AChE inhibitors, and compared to the activities at their corresponding isozymes, monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), respectively. Anti-oxidant properties, potentially useful in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, have been also investigated in\u00a0vitro. Among the evaluated compounds, three inhibitors may be considered as promising dual inhibitors of MAO-B and AChE, in\u00a0vitro. MAO-B inhibition was also shown to be competitive and reversible for compound 19.", "doi": "10.1016/j.ejmech.2017.10.050", "title": "Design, synthesis and biochemical evaluation of novel multi-target inhibitors as potential anti-Parkinson agents.", "journal": ["European journal of medicinal chemistry", "Eur J Med Chem"]}
