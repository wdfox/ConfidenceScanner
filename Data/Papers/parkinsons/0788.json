Three experts scored hand tremor using the modified Fahn- Tolosa-Marin (FTM) scale. A linear model was trained to estimate tremor severity using the recorded motion signals. The average neurologist FTM score was 1.6\u00b10.7 for PD and 2.6\u00b10.7 for ET patients. The average model score was 1.6\u00b10.7 for PD and 2.6\u00b10.6 for ET. Correlation coefficient between the clinical and model tremor scores was 0.91 (p\u200a<\u200a0.001). Motion data from an instrumented eating utensil accurately derived tremor ratings enabling practical, objective daily monitoring.", "doi": "10.3233/JPD-160929", "title": "Clinical Tremor Severity Estimation Using an Instrumented Eating Utensil.", "journal": ["Journal of Parkinson's disease", "J Parkinsons Dis"]}
