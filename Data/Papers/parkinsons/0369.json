In the faces task, when compared with the other groups, functional dystonia patients showed areas of decreased activation in the right middle temporal gyrus and bilateral precuneus and increased activation in the right inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral occipital cortex and fusiform gyrus, and bilateral cerebellum. In the intense-emotion task, when compared with the other groups, functional dystonia patients showed decreased activation in the left insular and left motor cortices (compared to organic dystonia, they showed an additional decrease in activation in the right opercular cortex and right motor cortex) and increased activation in the left fusiform gyrus.Functional dystonia patients exhibited stimulus-dependent altered activation in networks involved in motor preparation and execution, spatial cognition, and attentional control. These results support the presence of network dysfunction in functional dystonia. \u00a9 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.", "doi": "10.1002/mds.27217", "title": "Dysfunction in emotion processing underlies functional (psychogenic) dystonia.", "journal": ["Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "Mov.
