In addition to these core characteristics other movement disorders (e.g. dystonia, myoclonus, spasticity), and neuropsychiatric symptoms (e.g. depression, cognitive dysfunction) may occur in the course of the disease and can severely impair patients' quality of live. To date no causal therapy is available and therefore symptomatic treatment plays a pivotal role in patient care. In this article we provide an overview of frequent clinical symptoms and their symptomatic treatment options.", "doi": "10.1016/j.autneu.2017.10.006", "title": "Symptomatic therapy of multiple system atrophy.", "journal": ["Autonomic neuroscience : basic & clinical", "Auton Neurosci"]}
