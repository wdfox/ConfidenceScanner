In all cases, the vocal fold paralysis was bilateral and the main presenting symptoms were stridor and shortness of breath necessitating intubation and tracheostomy. This article describes the first case of PD presenting with dysphonia secondary to unilateral vocal fold paralysis (left). The management consisted of injection laryngoplasty for medialization of the paralyzed vocal fold.Patients with PD can present with unilateral vocal fold paralysis. Early treatment is advocated in view of the advent of injection laryngoplasty as a safe office procedure.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jvoice.2017.09.007", "title": "Unilateral Vocal Fold Paralysis in Parkinson Disease: Case Report and Review of the Literature.", "journal": ["Journal of voice : official journal of the Voice Foundation", "J Voice"]}
