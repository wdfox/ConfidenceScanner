The impact of cognitive and behavioral deficits on quality of life, associations between neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric findings and brain imaging, and cognitive and behavioral symptom management are also discussed.A review of the available MSA, PSP, and CBD literature was conducted, with emphasis given to studies investigating the cognitive and behavioral features of the syndromes.Although the three reviewed atypical parkinsonian syndromes share many similarities to each other and PD from a neuropsychological perspective, differences in prevalence and severity of cognitive impairment and patterns of performance on neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric measures exist in the research literature.Cognitive and behavioral features are early and pervasive aspects of MSA, PSP, and CBD.", "doi": "10.1093/arclin/acx093", "title": "The Neuropsychology (Broadly Conceived) of Multiple System Atrophy, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, and Corticobasal Degeneration.", "journal": ["Archives of clinical neuropsychology : the official journal of the National Academy of Neuropsychologists", "Arch Clin Neuropsychol"]}
