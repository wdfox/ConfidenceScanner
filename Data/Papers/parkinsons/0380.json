The objective of this review was to identify causes that lead to acute hospitalisation of patients with PD.A systematic review of English language literature from 1997 to present.The incidences of acute general medical or surgical problems that trigger acute hospitalisation in patients with PD are similar to those in the general population. However, falls, acute decompensation of PD symptoms and infections are far more common in PD patients and are responsible for more than 50% of the causes of hospitalisation in this patients' group.Preventive strategies to avoid decompensation of PD symptoms and early detection and treatment of infections are needed to reduce hospitalisation in patients with PD.", "doi": "10.1111/ijcp.13039", "title": "Factors that lead to hospitalisation in patients with Parkinson disease-A systematic review.", "journal": ["International journal of clinical practice", "Int.
