Baseline clinical and demographic variables, PD medications, neuroimaging, and genetic variables were evaluated as potential predictors of CSF biomarker changes.CSF biomarkers were stable over 6 and 12 months, and there was a small but significant increase in CSF A\u03b242 in both patients with patients with PD and HC from baseline to 12 months. The t-tau remained stable. The p-tau increased marginally more in patients with PD than in HC. \u03b1-syn remained relatively stable in patients with PD and HC. Ratios of p-tau/t-tau increased, while t-tau/A\u03b242 decreased over 12 months in patients with PD. CSF biomarker changes did not correlate with changes in Movement Disorder Society-sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor scores or dopamine imaging. CSF \u03b1-syn levels at 12 months were lower in patients with PD treated with dopamine replacement therapy, especially dopamine agonists.These core CSF biomarkers remained stable over 6 and 12 months in patients with early PD and HC. PD medication use may influence CSF \u03b1-syn. Novel biomarkers are needed to better profile progressive neurodegeneration in PD.", "doi": "10.1212/WNL.0000000000004609", "title": "Longitudinal CSF biomarkers in patients with early Parkinson disease and healthy controls.", "journal": ["Neurology", "Neurology"]}
