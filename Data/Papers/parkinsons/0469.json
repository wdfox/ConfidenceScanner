The frequencies of an abnormal spatial extension of the substantia nigra as well as the average sizes of left and right substantia nigra were evaluated.The average echogenic size of the substantia nigra was larger in methamphetamine users (0.22\u2009\u00b1\u20090.06\u2009cm2 ) when compared with controls (0.17\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05\u2009cm2 , P\u2009<\u2009.001). Furthermore, the frequency of enlarged, echogenic substantia nigra was increased in methamphetamine users (42% vs 12% in controls, P\u2009<\u2009.001). Partial correlation analysis revealed an association of echogenic substantia nigra size with estimated total lifetime intake of methamphetamine (r55 \u2009=\u20090.395, P\u2009=\u2009.002).Current data link methamphetamine abuse in humans to injury of substantia nigra neurons and an increased risk of Parkinson's disease. \u00a9 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.", "doi": "10.1002/mds.27205", "title": "Structural abnormality of substantia nigra induced by methamphetamine abuse.", "journal": ["Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "Mov.
