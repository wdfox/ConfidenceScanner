Interventional MRI (iMRI)-DBS is more anatomically accurate than traditional awake procedures and has similar clinical outcomes without increased risk or increased operative times. iMRI lead implantation allows patients to receive DBS therapy who cannot tolerate or do not agree to undergo an awake procedure. This article describes considerations for iMRI-DBS implantation in the subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus, including patient selection, technique of electrode placement, expected outcomes, and potential complications.", "doi": "10.1016/j.nec.2017.05.007", "title": "Interventional MRI-Guided Deep Brain Stimulation Lead Implantation.", "journal": ["Neurosurgery clinics of North America", "Neurosurg.
