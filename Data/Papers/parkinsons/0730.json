Data from patients with PD who previously or currently held a driving license at the time of the survey were analyzed.Complete datasets were obtained from 384 patients with PD who were either past or present driving license holders. Fifty-seven patients had caused at least one MVA in the last 5\u00a0years before the survey. Logistic regression analyses revealed that ergot-dopamine agonist (DA) use and excessive daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale score \u2265 10) were the best predictors of MVAs. Patients having caused non-sleep-related MVAs had significantly longer disease durations, more frequent ergot-DA use, and higher cognition and communication subscores on the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 than those without non-sleep-related MVAs (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05). The Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores of PD patients with sleep-related MVAs were significantly higher than those of patients without sleep-related MVAs (P\u00a0<\u00a0.01).Excessive daytime sleepiness and ergot-DA use may be important predictive risk factors for MVAs in PD. Daytime sleepiness appears to be related to sleep-related MVAs in PD, whereas disease progression and ergot-DA use may contribute to non-sleep-related MVAs.", "doi": "10.1111/ane.12849", "title": "Motor vehicle accidents in Parkinson's disease: A questionnaire study.", "journal": ["Acta neurologica Scandinavica", "Acta Neurol.
