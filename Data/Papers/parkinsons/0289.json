Enhancement of \u03b17 nAChR function is considered to be a potential therapeutic strategy aiming at ameliorating cognitive deficits of neuropsychiatric disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and schizophrenia. Currently, a number of \u03b17 nAChR modulators have been reported and several of them have advanced into clinical trials. In this brief review, we outline recent progress made in understanding the role of the \u03b17 nAChR in multiple neuropsychiatric disorders and the pharmacological effects of \u03b17 nAChR modulators used in clinical trials.", "doi": "10.1016/j.apsb.2017.09.001", "title": "The current agonists and positive allosteric modulators of \u03b17 nAChR for CNS indications in clinical trials.", "journal": ["Acta pharmaceutica Sinica.
