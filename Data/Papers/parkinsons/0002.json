We here provide an in-depth and critical review of the current literature regarding cognition after DBS in PD, summarizing the available data on the impact of STN and GPi DBS as monotherapies and also comparative data across these two therapies on 7 cognitive domains. We provide evidence that, in appropriately screened PD patients, worsening of one or more cognitive functions is rare and subtle after DBS, without negative impact on quality of life, and that there is very little data supporting that STN DBS has a worse cognitive outcome than GPi DBS.", "doi": "10.1155/2017/3085140", "title": "Cognitive Impact of Deep Brain Stimulation on Parkinson's Disease Patients.", "journal": ["Parkinson's disease", "Parkinsons Dis"]}
