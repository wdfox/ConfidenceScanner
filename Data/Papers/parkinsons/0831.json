Advanced PD (aPD) has a significant impact on quality-of-life (QoL) for patients and their caregivers/families. Levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) is indicated for the treatment of advanced levodopa-responsive PD with severe motor fluctuations and hyper-/dyskinesia when available combinations of therapy have not given satisfactory results.To determine the cost-effectiveness of LCIG vs standard of care (SoC) for the treatment of aPD patients.A Markov model was used to evaluate LCIG vs SoC in a hypothetical cohort of 100 aPD patients with severe motor fluctuations from an Irish healthcare perspective. Model health states were defined by Hoehn & Yahr (H&Y) scale-combined with amount of time in OFF-time-and death. SoC comprised of standard oral therapy\u2009\u00b1\u2009subcutaneous apomorphine infusion and standard follow-up visits. Clinical efficacy, utilities, and transition probabilities were derived from published studies. Resource use was estimated from individual patient-level data from Adelphi 2012 UK dataset, using Irish costs, where possible. Time horizon was 20 years. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 4%. Both one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted.The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for LCIG vs SOC was \u20ac26,944/quality adjusted life year (QALY) (total costs and QALYs for LCIG vs SoC: \u20ac537,687 vs \u20ac514,037 and 4.37 vs 3.49, respectively). LCIG is cost-effective at a payer threshold of \u20ac45,000. The model was most sensitive to health state costs.LCIG is a cost-effective treatment option compared with SoC in patients with aPD.", "doi": "10.1080/13696998.2017.1379411", "title": "The cost-effectiveness of levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel compared to standard care in advanced Parkinson's disease.", "journal": ["Journal of medical economics", "J Med Econ"]}
