Owing to this growing number of PD cases, it is more critical than ever to understand the pathogenic mechanisms underlying PD to identify therapeutic targets. The discovery of genetic mutations associated with PD and parkinsonism paves the way toward this goal. Even though, familial forms of the disease represent the minority of PD cases and some forms are so rare that there are only a few affected families, the research on the associated genes is invaluable. Recent additions to PARK mutations are those in PARK15 that encodes the F-box protein O-type 7 (FBXO7). In this review, we highlight the recent research on FBXO7, which advances our knowledge of the etiopathological pathways and fills unexpected gaps therein, justifying the dedicated study of rare variants of PD.", "doi": "10.1111/jnc.14253", "title": "Mechanistic contributions of FBXO7 to Parkinson disease.", "journal": ["Journal of neurochemistry", "J.
