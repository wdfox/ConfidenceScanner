Being implanted in a subcutaneous pocket in the chest region, thoracic surgical procedures can interfere with such devices, as they are sensible to external electromagnetic forces. Monopolar electrocautery can lead to dysfunction of the device or damage of the brain tissue caused by heat. We report a series of 3 patients with deep brain stimulators who underwent thoracic surgery. By turning off the deep brain stimulators before surgery and avoiding the use of monopolar cautery, electromagnetic interactions were avoided in all patients.", "doi": "10.1093/icvts/ivx213", "title": "Thoracic surgery in patients with an implanted neurostimulator device.", "journal": ["Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery", "Interact Cardiovasc Thorac Surg"]}
