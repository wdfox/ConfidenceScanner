Consecutive stroke patients were screened over a 12-month period using the TQ and the FMAS. SAS statistical software was used.Two hundred forty patients (52.5% females) were screened (mean age of 65 years, standard deviation, 14.5). Twenty-five percent of patients had a TQ score\u2009\u2265\u20094 with a median FMAS of 2. In this group, 32.6% (15/46) were found to have parkinsonism. Seventeen percent (8/46) were diagnosed with VasP having an FMAS of 4. Seventy-five of the participants obtained a TQ\u2009\u2264\u20093, with a median FMAS of 1. Only 1 patient in this group had parkinsonism (1.9%; 1/194). Using a cutoff of 4 points in the TQ resulted in a sensitivity of 93.8%, a specificity of 86.2% for parkinsonism, and a sensitivity of 100% with a specificity of 83% for VasP. Patients with FMAS\u2009=\u20094 (VasP) attained higher scores in the TQ with a median of 5 (Spearman rank correlation coefficient for the TQ and the FMAS (rs)\u2009=\u2009.447, P\u2009<\u2009.0005).We documented a prevalence of 3% (8/240) for VasP in an SPC. We propose a new, easier, and unified 2-step TQ-FMAS screening strategy for this condition.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2017.08.020", "title": "Vascular Parkinsonism in a Tertiary Care Stroke Prevention Clinic and the Development of a New Screening Strategy.", "journal": ["Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association", "J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis"]}
