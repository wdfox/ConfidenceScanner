Vitamin D deficiency was associated with increased disease severity and cognitive impairment in prevalent PD patients.The aim of the study was to determine 25(OH)D in newly diagnosed PD and age-matched controls and to assess if there was an association with clinical outcomes (disease severity, cognition and falls) over the 36-month follow up period.A prospective observational study of newly diagnosed PD patients in the North East of England with age-matched controls (PD, n\u200a=\u200a145; control, n\u200a=\u200a94). Serum 25(OH)D was assessed at baseline and 18 months. Participants underwent clinical assessment at baseline, 18 and 36 months. One hundred and ten participants with PD also took part in a prospective falls study.Mean serum 25(OH)D concentrations were lower in PD than control participants at baseline (44.1\u00b121.7 vs. 52.2\u00b122.1 nmol/L, p\u200a<\u200a0.05) and 18 months (44.2\u00b123.6 vs. 55.7\u00b128.8 nmol/L, p\u200a<\u200a0.05). Baseline serum 25(OH)D concentration, age, motor score and dosage of dopaminergic medication were significant predictors of variance of motor severity at 36 months ((\u0394R2\u200a=\u200a0.039, F\u200a=\u200a6.6, p\u200a<\u200a0.01). Serum 25(OH)D was not associated with cognition or falls during the follow up period.Patients with incident PD had significantly lower serum 25(OH)D concentrations than age-matched controls, which may have implications in terms of bone health and fracture risk. There was a small but significant association between vitamin D status at baseline and disease motor severity at 36 months.", "doi": "10.3233/JPD-171122", "title": "The Role of Vitamin D in Disease Progression in Early Parkinson's Disease.", "journal": ["Journal of Parkinson's disease", "J Parkinsons Dis"]}
