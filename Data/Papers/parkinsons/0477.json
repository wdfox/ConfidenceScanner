However, deleterious microenvironmental and endogenous factors (e.g., oxidative stress) compromise ongoing graft survival and longevity. Therefore, (transient or stable) genetically modified cells may be reasonably thought to resist oxidative stress-induced damage. Genetic engineering of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) obtained from Wharton's jelly tissue may offer some therapeutic potential. PARKIN is a multifunctional ubiquitin ligase able to protect dopaminergic cells against stress-related signaling. We, therefore, evaluated the effect of the neurotoxicant 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) on regulated cell death signaling in MSCs and investigated whether overexpression of PARKIN in MSCs was capable of modulating the effect of 6-OHDA.We transiently transfected Wharton's jelly-derived MSCs with an mCherry-PARKIN vector using the Lipofectamine LTX method. Na\u00efve MSCs and MSCs overexpressing PARKIN were exposed to increasing concentrations of 6-OHDA. We used light and fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, immunocytochemistry staining, in-cell Western and Western blot analysis.After 12-24\u2009h of 6-OHDA exposure, we detected dichlorofluorescein (DCF)-positive cells (80%) indicative of reactive oxygen species (H2O2) production, reduced cell viability (40-50%), decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m, ~35-45%), DNA fragmentation (18-30%), and G1-arrested cell cycle in the MSCs. 6-OHDA exposure increased the expression of the transcription factor c-JUN, increased the expression of the mitochondria maintenance Phosphatase and tensin homologue-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) protein and increased the expression of pro-apoptotic PUMA, caspase-3 and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). 6-OHDA exposure also significantly augmented the oxidation of the oxidative stress sensor, DJ-1. Overexpression of PARKIN in MSCs not only significantly reduced the expression of cell death and oxidative stress markers but also significantly reduced DCF-positive cells (~50% reduction).6-OHDA induced apoptosis in MSCs via generation of H2O2, activation of c-JUN and PUMA, mitochondrial depolarization and nuclei fragmentation. Our findings suggest that PARKIN protects MSCs against 6-OHDA toxicity by partly interacting with H2O2, reducing the expression of c-JUN, PUMA, AIF and caspase-3, and maintaining the mitochondrial \u0394\u03a8m.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jcyt.2017.09.011", "title": "PARKIN overexpression in human mesenchymal stromal cells from Wharton's jelly suppresses 6-hydroxydopamine-induced apoptosis: Potential therapeutic strategy in Parkinson's disease.", "journal": ["Cytotherapy", "Cytotherapy"]}
