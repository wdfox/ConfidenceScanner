Investigating and measuring this behavior by using quantitative and objective methods is difficult. Insights from lesion studies contribute to analyze the effects of neurological disorders on human sexual behavior. In this chapter, we focus on frontal lobe lesions, brain injuries, epilepsia, dementia, and Parkinson disease to describe human sexual behavior disorders, in order to highlight cortical and subcortical brain regions and neural networks involved in human sexual behavior.", "doi": "10.1159/000475693", "title": "Hypersexuality in Neurological Disorders: From Disinhibition to Impulsivity.", "journal": ["Frontiers of neurology and neuroscience", "Front Neurol Neurosci"]}
