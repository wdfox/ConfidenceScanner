The objective of this study was to examine the effects of a resistance training program on dynamic balance and fatigue in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).Randomized controlled trial. Forty-six patients with PD were randomly allocated to an intervention group receiving a 8-week resistance training program focused on lower limbs or to a control group. Balance was assessed using the Mini-BESTest and fatigue was assessed by the Piper Fatigue Scale.Patients in the intervention group improved significantly (p<0.05) on dynamic balance (reactive postural control and total values) and perceived fatigue.An 8-week resistance training program was found to be effective at improving dynamic balance and fatigue in patients with PD.", "doi": "10.1016/j.medcli.2017.10.022", "title": "Effects of a resistance training program on balance and fatigue perception in patients with Parkinson's disease: A randomized controlled trial.", "journal": ["Medicina clinica", "Med Clin (Barc)"]}
