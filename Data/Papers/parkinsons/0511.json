Data from a previous study by Fisher and Goberman (2010) were used to compare the VOT measures obtained from a group of speakers with PD with both ON and OFF medication, and a group of healthy controls. Supplementing the previous findings, the current analysis revealed that individuals with PD exhibited significantly less contrast between voiced and voiceless VOT than that observed in healthy speakers. Medication administration did not affect VOT contrast as no differences in VOT separation were observed between the ON and OFF medication states.", "doi": "10.1080/02699206.2017.1387816", "title": "Voicing contrast of stop consonant production in the speech of individuals with Parkinson disease ON and OFF dopaminergic medication.", "journal": ["Clinical linguistics & phonetics", "Clin Linguist Phon"]}
