Twelve patients were \u226580 years. A median dose of 140 Gy (range, 130-150 Gy) was delivered to the nucleus ventralis intermedius through a single 4-mm isocenter. We used the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin clinical tremor rating scale to score tremor, handwriting, drawing, and ability to drink fluids. The median time to the last follow-up was 23 months (range, 9-144 months).After GKT, 31 patients (93.9%) experienced improvement in tremor. Twenty-three patients (70.0%) had complete or nearly complete tremor arrest. Nine patients (27.2%) noted tremor arrest and resolution of impairment in writing, drawing, and ability to drink fluids. One patient (3%) improved in bradykinesia, 3 patients (9%) improved in rigidity, and 3 patients (9%) decreased their dosage of dopa after GKT. Tremor relief was fully maintained in the last follow-up for 96.8% of responding patients. Two patients (6%) experienced temporary adverse radiation effects.GKT is a safe and effective treatment for medically refractory PD tremor, especially for the elderly or those not suitable for deep brain stimulation or thermal thalamotomy.", "doi": "10.1159/000479236", "title": "Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Intractable Tremor-Dominant Parkinson Disease: A Retrospective Analysis.", "journal": ["Stereotactic and functional neurosurgery", "Stereotact Funct Neurosurg"]}
