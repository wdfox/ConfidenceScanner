Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to assess the risk of subsequent Parkinson's disease.We observed 64 cases of Parkinson's disease in the HP infection group (1.7/1000 person-years), and 25 cases in the control group (0.7/1000 person-years). Overall, there was a significantly higher risk of Parkinson's disease in the HP infection group (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 2.29, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.44-3.66). HP infection was significantly associated with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease among individuals who were \u226560 years old (aHR: 2.53, 95% CI: 1.47-4.35), but not among those <60 years old (aHR: 1.86, 95% CI: 0.69-4.98). Furthermore, HP infection was associated with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease among both men (aHR: 2.14, 95% CI: 1.15-3.96) and women (aHR: 2.84, 95% CI: 1.37-5.89). Nonetheless, eradication therapy was not significantly associated with the risk of Parkinson's disease (aHR: 1.07, 95% CI: 0.63-1.82).Although HP infection was associated with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease, eradication therapy did not ameliorate this association. Further research is needed to explore the underlying biological mechanisms.", "doi": "10.1016/j.parkreldis.2017.11.331", "title": "Helicobacter pylori infection is associated with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease: A population-based retrospective cohort study.", "journal": ["Parkinsonism & related disorders", "Parkinsonism Relat.
