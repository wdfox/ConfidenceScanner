We currently further confirmed that DBZIM ameliorated the Parkinsonian motor deficit and protected the nigrostriatal tract from the neurotoxicity of 1-methyl-4-(2'-methylphenyl)-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (2'-CH3-MPTP) in C57Bl/6 mice. The dopaminergic degeneration in the substantia nigra par compacta (SNc) and striatum was analyzed by immunohistochemistry while the monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibition effect of DBZIM was determined by enzyme kinetics. DBZIM was at least as effective as the clinically approved anti-PD drug, l-deprenyl (Selegiline), for both neuroprotection and correction of motor deficits. Mechanistically, DBZIM inhibited the specific activity of MAO-B in the striatum and C6 cells without affecting the protein expression. DBZIM directly inhibited the enzymatic activity of a purified MAO-B protein with an estimated Ki value from 780 to 940nM, in par with that of l-deprenyl (970nM). The physical interaction between DBZIM and MAO-B was proven by NMR analysis, with Kd around 21.5-46.8\u03bcM. Our binding and modelling data further illustrated that DBZIM is a mixed inhibitor with its binding to active site partially hindering the substrate binding. Therefore, inhibiting MAO-B is a major mechanism through which DBZIM confers neuroprotection for the dopaminergic neurons against 2'-CH3-MPTP toxicity. Remarkably, the post-lesion treatment with DBZIM provided greater anti-parkinsonian and neuroprotective effects than the l-deprenyl. The current study, together with our previous findings in a 6-OHDA PD model, demonstrated that DBZIM is a promising neuroprotectant for PD with anti-MAO-B property.", "doi": "10.1016/j.ejphar.2017.10.023", "title": "A novel selective MAO-B inhibitor with neuroprotective and anti-Parkinsonian properties.", "journal": ["European journal of pharmacology", "Eur.
