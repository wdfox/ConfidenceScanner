Progression of PD is paralleled by a progressive difficulty in achieving the balance. Functional neurosurgical procedures provide sustained relief of LID in carefully selected patients when further tailoring of medical therapy fails to achieve this goal. Though deep brain stimulation (DBS) has superseded lesioning surgeries, pallidotomy still has a role in those patients in whom DBS is not feasible for financial or other reasons.", "doi": "10.4103/aian.AIAN_244_17", "title": "Surgical Treatment of Levodopa-induced Dyskinesia in Parkinson's Disease.", "journal": ["Annals of Indian Academy of Neurology", "Ann Indian Acad Neurol"]}
