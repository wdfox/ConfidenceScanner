Both the disorders have completely opposite pathophysiology and treatment of one disorder with available pharmacological agents can pose a threat to the other disorder. The situation becomes graver and risk of adverse side effects increases when an individual presents at a later age with both these disorders along with compromised physical and mental health. Of all the available psychopharmacological agents, clozapine has been found to be quite helpful for the management of psychosis without deterioration of existing movement problems of Parkinson's disease. In this case report, we present the case of a 60-year-old female with long-standing paranoid schizophrenia for the last 30 years, who later developed IPD and discuss the various management issues encountered during her treatment.", "doi": "10.4103/IJPSYM.IJPSYM_68_17", "title": "Schizophrenia with Comorbid Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease: A Difficult Clinical Management Scenario.", "journal": ["Indian journal of psychological medicine", "Indian J Psychol Med"]}
