The coexistence of these two disease is extremely rare, with only four cases hitherto reported across the public databases. It is also noteworthy that biochemical tests, which are critical for the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma, are severely confounded by dopaminergic medications for Parkinson's disease, highlighting the importance of image-based modalities in this setting. We further attempted to gain insight into the potential molecular mechanisms, proposing that hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) signaling could make these two diseases mutually exclusive, while excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) could enable their coexistence.", "doi": "10.2169/internalmedicine.9242-17", "title": "A Rare Coexistence of Pheochromocytoma and Parkinson's Disease With Diagnostic Challenges : A Case Report.", "journal": ["Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)", "Intern.
