In particular, its impact on health care utilization has been insufficiently examined. We sought to determine the differential health care utilization in PD patients with (PDOH+) and without OH (PDOH-).We quantified the emergency room (ER) visits, hospitalizations, outpatient clinic evaluations, phone calls, and e-mails from PD patients on whom supine and orthostatic blood pressure (BP) measurements were obtained during routine clinical practice between June 2013 and July 2016. Comparative costs between PDOH+ and PDOH- were adjusted for age, disease duration, motor severity, levodopa equivalent daily dose, and Montreal Cognitive Assessment.From a total of 317 PD patients, 29.3% were classified as PDOH+ (n\u00a0=\u00a093) and 70.6% as PDOH- (n\u00a0=\u00a0224) over 30.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.0 months, in which there were 247 hospitalizations, 170\u00a0ER visits, 2386 outpatient evaluations, and 4747 telephone calls/e-mails. After-adjusting for relevant covariates, PDOH+ was associated with more hospitalization days (+285%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.041), ER visits (+152%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.045), and telephone calls/e-mails than PDOH- (+142%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.009). The overall health care-related cost in PDOH+ was 2.5-fold higher than for PDOH- ($25,205\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0$6546 vs. $9831\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0$4167/person/year; p\u00a0=\u00a00.037).OH increases health care utilization in PD independently from age, disease duration, motor severity, dopaminergic treatment, and cognitive function.", "doi": "10.1016/j.parkreldis.2017.11.344", "title": "Orthostatic hypotension in Parkinson disease: Impact on health care utilization.", "journal": ["Parkinsonism & related disorders", "Parkinsonism Relat.
