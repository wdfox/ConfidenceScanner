So far, several strategies have been applied in order to suppress \u03b1-synuclein aggregation and toxicity in Parkinson's disease. In the present study, a new database has been established by segmentation of all the proteins deposited in protein Data Bank. The database data base was searched for the sequences which adopt \u03b2 structure and are identical or very similar to the regions of \u03b1-synuclein which are involved in aggregation. The adjacent \u03b2 strands of the found sequences were chosen as the peptide inhibitors of \u03b1-synuclein aggregation. Two of the predicted peptides, namely KISVRV and GQTYVLPG, were experimentally proved to be efficient in suppressing aggregation of \u03b1-synuclein in\u00a0vitro. Moreover, KISVRV exhibited the ability to disrupt oligomers of \u03b1-syn which are assumed to be the pathogenic species in Parkinson's disease.", "doi": "10.1016/j.abb.2017.09.015", "title": "The inhibitory effects of biomimetically designed peptides on \u03b1-synuclein aggregation.", "journal": ["Archives of biochemistry and biophysics", "Arch.
