Evidence suggests a physiological function of \u03b1S in vesicle trafficking and release. In contrast to earlier tenets, recent work indicates that \u03b1S normally exists in cells in a dynamic equilibrium between monomers and tetramers/multimers. We engineered \u03b1S mutants incapable of multimerization, leading to excess monomers at vesicle membranes. By EM, such mutants induced prominent vesicle clustering, leading to round cytoplasmic inclusions. Immunogold labeling revealed abundant \u03b1S intimately associated with vesicles of varied size. Fluorescence microscopy with marker proteins showed that the \u03b1S-associated vesicles were of diverse endocytic and secretory origin. An \u03b1S '3K' mutant (E35K\u2009+\u2009E46K\u2009+\u2009E61K) that amplifies the PD/DLB-causing E46K mutation induced \u03b1S-rich vesicle clusters resembling the vesicle-rich areas of Lewy bodies, supporting pathogenic relevance. Mechanistically, E46K can increase \u03b1S vesicle binding via membrane-induced amphipathic helix formation, and '3K' further enhances this effect. Another engineered \u03b1S variant added hydrophobicity to the hydrophobic half of \u03b1S helices, thereby stabilizing \u03b1S-membrane interactions. Importantly, substituting charged for uncharged residues within the hydrophobic half of the stabilized helix not only reversed the strong membrane interaction of the multimer-abolishing \u03b1S variant but also restored multimerization and prevented the aberrant vesicle interactions. Thus, reversible \u03b1S amphipathic helix formation and dynamic multimerization regulate a normal function of \u03b1S at vesicles, and abrogating multimers has pathogenic consequences.", "doi": "10.1093/hmg/ddx227", "title": "Loss of native \u03b1-synuclein multimerization by strategically mutating its amphipathic helix causes abnormal vesicle interactions in neuronal cells.", "journal": ["Human molecular genetics", "Hum.
