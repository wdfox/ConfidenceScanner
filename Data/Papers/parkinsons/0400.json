Therefore, in vivo imaging of \u03b1-syn aggregates would aid in drug development, early diagnosis, and monitoring of disease status. In order to develop imaging probes targeting \u03b1-syn aggregates, we synthesized and evaluated three novel radioiodinated benzimidazole (BI) derivatives for selective imaging of \u03b1-syn aggregates. In binding experiments, BI-2 exhibited the highest selective binding affinity for \u03b1-syn aggregates among the BI derivatives. In addition, BI-2 clearly stained Lewy bodies in PD brain sections, but did not label senile plaques deposited in AD brain sections. However, in the biodistribution study using normal mice, [125I]BI-2 did not demonstrate high brain uptake (0.56%ID/g at 2-min post-injection). Further structural modifications of the BI derivatives are needed, but the BI scaffold may be an attractive candidate for developing \u03b1-syn imaging probes.", "doi": "10.1016/j.bmc.2017.10.010", "title": "Synthesis and biological evaluation of novel radioiodinated benzimidazole derivatives for imaging \u03b1-synuclein aggregates.", "journal": ["Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry", "Bioorg.
