The potential therapeutic benefits of naturally occurring phytochemicals as pharmacological modulators of autophagy will also be addressed. Our findings provide renewed insight on the molecular modes of protection by polyphenols, which is likely to be at least in part mediated not only by their potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, but also through modulation of autophagic processes to remove the aberrant protein aggregates.", "doi": "10.1016/j.biotechadv.2017.12.001", "title": "Regulation of autophagy by polyphenols: Paving the road for treatment of neurodegeneration.", "journal": ["Biotechnology advances", "Biotechnol.
