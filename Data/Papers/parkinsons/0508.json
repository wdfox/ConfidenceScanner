Yet, occurrence of dementia in PD is unpredictable. Evidence supports the hypothesis that insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is involved in cognitive deficits. Our aim was to evaluate the relationship between serum IGF-1 levels and neuropsychological scores in a large cohort of drug-na\u00efve PD patients during the earliest stages of the disease.Serum IGF-1 levels were determined in 405 early, drug-na\u00efve PD patients and 191 healthy controls (HC) enrolled in the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). The association between serum IGF-1 levels and neuropsychological scores was evaluated with linear regression analysis.IGF-1 levels were similar in PD and HC. In PD patients the lowest IGF-1 quartile was a predictor of lower performances at the Semantic Fluency task (\u03b2 = -3.46, 95%CI: -5.87 to -1.01, p = 0.005), the Symbol Digit Modalities Score (\u03b2 = -2.09, 95%CI: -4.02 to -0.15, p = 0.034), and Hopkins Verbal Learning Test Retention (\u03b2 = -0.05, 95%CI: -0.09 to -0.009, p = 0.019).Lower serum IGF-1 levels are associated to poor performances in cognitive tasks assessing executive function, attention and verbal memory in a large cohort of early PD patients. Follow-up studies are warranted to assess if IGF-1 is related to the development of dementia in PD.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0186508", "title": "Serum IGF-1 is associated with cognitive functions in early, drug-na\u00efve Parkinson's disease.", "journal": ["PloS one", "PLoS ONE"]}
