This is due to the characteristics of the IoT (Internet of Things), which allows data to be measured and transmitted at any time, anywhere. In this study, we developed a health data collection platform that stores and transmits the foot pressure data of Parkinson patients using FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources). The platform can be used to collect the foot pressure of a large number of Parkinson's patients. Based on the accumulated data, it is possible to identify abnormal behaviors such as walking pattern, tilt and instability of stride length in patients with Parkinson's disease. Based on the results of this study, accurate diagnosis and treatment of Parkinson's disease can be made.", "doi": null, "title": "Development of Parkinson Patient Generated Data Collection Platform Using FHIR and IoT Devices.", "journal": ["Studies in health technology and informatics", "Stud Health Technol Inform"]}
