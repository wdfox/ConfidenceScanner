Additionally, articles provide overviews of neuropsychological and ethical issues related to deep brain stimulation and a discussion of non-pharamcologic and non-invasive treatment of cognitive dysfunction in Parkinson's disease. A search of PubMed using neuropsycholog* and parkinson* as search terms indicates that the number of articles dealing with neuropsychology of parkinsonian disorders has more than doubled in each of the past three decades (1990-99:269 entries, 2000-09:575 entries, 2010-17:967 entries). This rapid growth of research makes a special issue on the topic very timely.", "doi": "10.1093/arclin/acx087", "title": "Introduction to the Special Issue on Clinical Neuropsychology of Movement Disorders.", "journal": ["Archives of clinical neuropsychology : the official journal of the National Academy of Neuropsychologists", "Arch Clin Neuropsychol"]}
