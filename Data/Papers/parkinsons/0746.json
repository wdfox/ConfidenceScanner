Resting \u03b2-low \u03b3 PAC, also present in dystonia patients, inversely correlated with severity of rigidity and bradykinesia (R=-0.44, P=0.028). These findings were specific to the low \u03b2 band, suggesting a differential role for the two \u03b2 sub-bands.PAC is present across distinct frequency bands within the GPi. Given the presence of low \u03b2-low \u03b3 PAC in dystonia and the inverse correlation with symptom severity, we propose that this PAC may be a normal pallidal signal.This study provides new evidence on the pathophysiological contribution of local pallidal coupling and suggests similar and distinct patterns of coupling within GPi and STN in PD.", "doi": "10.1016/j.clinph.2017.08.001", "title": "Pallidal low \u03b2-low \u03b3 phase-amplitude coupling inversely correlates with Parkinson disease symptoms.", "journal": ["Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "Clin Neurophysiol"]}
