This study sought to analyze apathy and depression in patients with PD dementia (PDD). Forty patients were diagnosed with PDD using the Movement Disorder Society criteria. A statistically significant correlation was identified between worsening dementia and an improvement in depression ( r = .3695; r2 = .1365, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.0985 to 05.894, P = .0044) and between worsening dementia and worsening apathy ( r = -.2578, r2 = .0664, 95% CI: -0.5025 to .0251, P = .036). Depression had a greater correlation with advanced motor symptoms ( r = .4988, r2 = .2438, 95% CI: 0.2218-0.7013, P = .0005]. In conclusion, depression was associated with less advanced PDD and more intense motor features, while apathy was associated with more advanced cognitive impairment.", "doi": "10.1177/1533317517728333", "title": "Differentiating Between Apathy and Depression in Patients With Parkinson Disease Dementia.", "journal": ["American journal of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias", "Am J Alzheimers Dis Other Demen"]}
