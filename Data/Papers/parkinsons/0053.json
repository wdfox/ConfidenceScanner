The notification of the causative drugs is crucial to the treatment of DIPU. We herein report the case of a 56-year-old woman with early-stage Parkinson's disease who developed DIPUs after starting olanzapine treatment for depressive symptoms. Our findings illustrate that if an akinetic patient with pressure ulcers is encountered, the patient's medication should be reviewed by a multidisciplinary team, to evaluate whether the development of the pressure ulcer is drug-related, regardless of the patient's age.", "doi": "10.2169/internalmedicine.9700-17", "title": "Drug-induced Pressure Ulcers in a Middle-aged Patient with Early-stage Parkinson's Disease.", "journal": ["Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)", "Intern.
