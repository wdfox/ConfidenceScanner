This journey has been marked by the revolutionary discovery of a neurotransmitter replacement therapy that provides a longer and healthier life to patients. Since 1997, the advances in the genetics of PD have expanded our understanding of this neurodegenerative disorder and they are opening up new\u00a0ways to search for disease-modifying therapies. This chapter is a summary of the historical discoveries and latest progress in PD research.", "doi": "10.1016/bs.adgen.2017.08.001", "title": "The Genetics of Parkinson\u00a0Disease.", "journal": ["Advances in genetics", "Adv.
