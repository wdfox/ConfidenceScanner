We compared in vivo 18 F-flortaucipir uptake in patients meeting clinical research criteria for PSP (n\u2009=\u200933) to normal controls (n\u2009=\u200946) and patients meeting criteria for Parkinson disease (PD; n\u2009=\u200926).Participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography for amyloid-\u03b2 (11 C-PiB or 18 F-florbetapir) and tau (18 F-flortaucipir). 18 F-flortaucipir standardized uptake value ratios were calculated (t\u2009=\u200980-100 minutes, cerebellum gray matter reference). Voxelwise and region-of-interest group comparisons were performed in template space, with receiver operating characteristic curve analyses to assess single-subject discrimination. Qualitative comparisons with postmortem tau are reported in 1 patient who died 9 months after 18 F-flortaucipir.Clinical PSP patients showed bilaterally elevated 18 F-flortaucipir uptake in globus pallidus, putamen, subthalamic nucleus, midbrain, and dentate nucleus relative to controls and PD patients (voxelwise p\u2009<\u20090.05 family wise error corrected). Globus pallidus binding best distinguished PSP patients from controls and PD (area under the curve [AUC]\u2009=\u20090.872 vs controls, AUC\u2009=\u20090.893 vs PD). PSP clinical severity did not correlate with 18 F-flortaucipir in any region. A patient with clinical PSP and pathological diagnosis of corticobasal degeneration had severe tau pathology in PSP-related brain structures with good correspondence between in vivo 18 F-flortaucipir and postmortem tau neuropathology.18 F-flortaucipir uptake was elevated in PSP versus controls and PD patients in a pattern consistent with the expected distribution of tau pathology.
