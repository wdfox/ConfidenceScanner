Both the presence of the protein \u03b1-synuclein in intracellular protein aggregates in surviving neurons and the genetic linking of the \u03b1-synuclein encoding gene point towards a major role of \u03b1-synuclein in PD etiology. The exact pathogenic mechanisms of PD development are not entirely described to date, neither is the specific role of \u03b1-synuclein in this context. Previous studies indicate that one aspect of \u03b1-synuclein-related cellular toxicity might be direct proteasome impairment. The 20/26S proteasomal machinery is an important instrument of intracellular protein degradation. Thus, direct proteasome impairment by \u03b1-synuclein might explain or at least contribute to the formation of intracellular protein aggregates. Therefore this study investigates direct proteasomal impairment by \u03b1-synuclein both in vitro using recombinant \u03b1-synuclein and isolated proteasomes as well as in living cells. Our experiments demonstrate that the impairment of proteasome activity by \u03b1-synuclein is highly dependent upon the cellular background and origin. We show that recombinant \u03b1-synuclein oligomers and fibrils scarcely affect 20S proteasome function in vitro, neither does transient \u03b1-synuclein expression in U2OS ps 2042 (Ubi(G76V)-GFP) cells. However, stable expression of both wild-type and mutant \u03b1-synuclein in dopaminergic SH-SY5Y and PC12 cells results in a prominent impairment of the chymotrypsin-like 20S/26S proteasomal protein cleavage. Thus, our results support the idea that \u03b1-synuclein in a specific cellular environment, potentially present in dopaminergic cells, cannot be processed by the proteasome and thus contributes to a selective vulnerability of dopaminergic cells to \u03b1-synuclein pathology.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0184040", "title": "Proteasome impairment by \u03b1-synuclein.", "journal": ["PloS one", "PLoS ONE"]}
