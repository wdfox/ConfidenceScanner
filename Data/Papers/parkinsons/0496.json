In the present study, we investigated the role of Nrf2 in paraquat-induced intracorporeal neurodegeneration and miRNA expression by exposing Nrf2 wild-type and knockout mice to paraquat (PQ) or 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Exposure to 10\u2009mg/kg PQ or 30\u2009mg/kg MPTP caused damage to nerve cells in the substantia nigra (SN) in both Nrf2 (+/+) and Nrf2 (-/-) ICR mice, which included cell morphological changes, detectable apoptosis and a significant reduction in the number of dopaminergic (DA) neurons. When mice were exposed to the same PQ dose of 10\u2009mg/kg, significant fewer tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive DA neurons were observed in the Nrf2 (-/-) mice than that in the Nrf2 (+/+) mice. Both Nrf2 deficiency and PQ or MPTP exposure could alter miRNA expression profile in the SN, suggesting the potential involvement of Nrf2 in the PQ-induced or MPTP-induced miRNA expression alteration. The expression of miR-380-3p was altered by the Nrf2-MPTP interaction effect. miR-380-3p/Sp3-mRNA pathway is likely part of the mechanism of MPTP-induced neurodegeneration. Collectively, our results corroborated the protective role of Nrf2 and also demonstrated the essential interaction of Nrf2 with miRNAs in intracorporal neurodegeneration induced by neurotoxicants.", "doi": "10.1038/s41531-017-0033-1", "title": "Paraquat and MPTP induce neurodegeneration and alteration in the expression profile of microRNAs: the role of transcription factor Nrf2.", "journal": ["NPJ Parkinson's disease", "NPJ Parkinsons Dis"]}
