Herein, we report that a Mn3 O4 nanozyme functionally mimics three major antioxidant enzymes, that is, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and the multienzyme activity is size as well as morphology-dependent. The redox modulatory effect of Mn3 O4 plays a crucial role in protecting the cells from MPP+ induced cytotoxicity in a Parkinson disease (PD)-like cellular model, indicating that manganese-based nanomaterials having multi-enzyme activity can robustly rescue the cells from oxidative damage and thereby possess therapeutic potential to prevent ROS-mediated neurological disorders.", "doi": "10.1002/anie.201708573", "title": "A Redox Modulatory Mn3 O4 Nanozyme with Multi-Enzyme Activity Provides Efficient Cytoprotection to Human Cells in a Parkinson's Disease Model.", "journal": ["Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English)", "Angew.
