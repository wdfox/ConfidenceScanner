Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the positive expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine transporter (DAT) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Deutocerebrum primary cells were extracted and classified into the control, 6-OHDA, Cur (5, 10, 15 \u00b5mol/L), Dickkopf-1 (DKK-1) and Cur + DKK-1 groups. MTT assays, adhesion tests and TUNEL staining were used to assess cell viability, adhesion and apoptosis, respectively. Western blotting and qRT-PCR were used to examine the protein and mRNA expressions of Wnt3a and \u03b2-catenin and the c-myc and cyclinD1 mRNA expressions.TH and DAT expressions in the Cur group were elevated and GFAP was reduced compared with the 6-OHDA group. Curcumin enhanced viability, survival and adhesion and attenuated apoptosis of deutocerebrum primary cells by activating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway. Higher Wnt3a and \u03b2-catenin mRNA and protein expressions and c-myc and cyclinD1 mRNA expressions, enhanced superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) contents, decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) content and elevated mitochondrial membrane potential (\u2206\u03c8m) were found in the 10 and 15 \u00b5mol/L Cur groups compared with the 6-OHDA group. However, opposite tendencies were found in the Cur + DKK-1 group compared to the 10 \u00b5mol/L Cur group.This study suggests that curcumin could protect against oxidative stress-induced injury in PD rats via the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway.", "doi": "10.1159/000484302", "title": "Protective Effect of Curcumin Against Oxidative Stress-Induced Injury in Rats with Parkinson's Disease Through the Wnt/ \u03b2-Catenin Signaling Pathway.", "journal": ["Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology", "Cell.
