The overall prevalence of antipsychotic use was 9.8% (29 of 296); 95.5% (28 of 29) of the patients had dementia when initiating antipsychotics. The most frequent indication (71.4%; 20 of 28) was psychosis or behavior threatening to the patient or others.The prevalence of antipsychotic use in patients with PD is lower than expected from previously reported cumulative incidences. Dementia is highly prevalent in those starting antipsychotics. Most of the patients on antipsychotics had a reasonable risk-benefit ratio for taking them. \u00a9 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.", "doi": "10.1002/mds.27256", "title": "Prevalence of and indications for antipsychotic use in Parkinson's disease.", "journal": ["Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "Mov.
