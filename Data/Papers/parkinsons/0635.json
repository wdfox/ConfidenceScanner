Our previous study has shown that uric acid protected dopaminergic cell line damage through inhibiting accumulation of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). This study aimed to investigate its in\u00a0vivo neuroprotective effect. PD was induced by MPTP intraperitoneally injection for 7\u00a0d in male C57BL/6 mice. Mice were treated with either uric acid (intraperitoneally injection 250\u00a0mg/kg) or saline for a total of 13\u00a0d. We showed that uric acid improved behavioral performances and cognition of PD mice, increased TH-positive dopaminergic neurons and decreased GFAP-positive astrocytes in substantia nigra (SN). Uric acid increased mRNA and protein expressions of Nrf2 and three Nrf2-responsive genes, including \u03b3-glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (\u03b3-GCLC), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and NQO1. Uric acid significantly increased superoxide dismutase (SOD), CAT, glutathione (GSH) levels and decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) level in SN regions of MPTP-treated mice. Uric acid inhibited the hippocampal expression of IL-1\u03b2 and decreased serum and hippocampus levels of interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). In conclusion, uric acid demonstrates neuroprotective properties for dopaminergic neurons in PD mice through modulation of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress.", "doi": "10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.10.004", "title": "Uric acid demonstrates neuroprotective effect on Parkinson's disease mice through Nrf2-ARE signaling pathway.", "journal": ["Biochemical and biophysical research communications", "Biochem.
