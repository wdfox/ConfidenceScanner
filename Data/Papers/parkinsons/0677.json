The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), otherwise, has shown greater sensitivity when compared to the MMSE. Based on this, we have searched for the cognitive impairment measurable by the MoCA and the functional performance on activities of daily living in a sample of Brazilian patients with PD and normal MMSE. We hypothesized that the low sensitivity of the MMSE, already shown by other authors, could be replicated in a low-income country.To describe the performance on the MoCA and the dependence on third parties for activities of daily living in a sample of Brazilian patients with PD and normal MMSE.We evaluated 43 volunteers with PD and normal MMSE considering the Brazilian cutoffs. Cognitive performance was assessed through the MoCA and functional performance through a modified version of the Disability Assessment for Dementia Scale.Despite normal score on the MMSE, considering the Brazilian cutoffs, 62.7% of the volunteers performed below the literature cutoff for the MoCA (26 points). Furthermore, 30.2% had dependence on third party for activities of daily living. By using a strict cutoff for the MMSE (26 points), 56.7% performed below the MoCA cutoff and 24.3% had dependence for activities of daily living.Our findings confirm the limitations of the MMSE for the cognitive screening of patients with PD in a low-income country.", "doi": "10.1177/0891988717731826", "title": "Low Sensitivity of the Mini-Mental State Examination for Cognitive Assessment of Brazilian Patients With Parkinson Disease.", "journal": ["Journal of geriatric psychiatry and neurology", "J Geriatr Psychiatry Neurol"]}
