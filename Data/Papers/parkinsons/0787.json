In Cross-sectional analysis, SU performed better on global cognition, Trails B, semantic fluency, and phonemic fluency tasks. Rate of long-term global cognitive (Dementia Rating Scale-2 and MoCA) decline was significantly less in SU.", "doi": "10.3233/JPD-171113", "title": "Statins and Cognition in Parkinson's Disease.", "journal": ["Journal of Parkinson's disease", "J Parkinsons Dis"]}
