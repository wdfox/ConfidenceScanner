We herein report a PD patient who underwent left ventral intermediate nucleus and ventro oralis posterior nucleus thalamotomy using magnetic resonance imaging-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS). Right-side resting tremor and rigidity were abolished immediately following the ultrasound energy delivery. In addition, left-side resting tremor and rigidity also improved. No adverse events occurred during the procedure. We observed the exacerbation of bradykinesia, which might have been caused by edema around the target. This is the first report of thalamotomy using MRgFUS for PD patient from Japan. Further investigations concerning the efficacy and safety of this procedure are necessary.", "doi": "10.2169/internalmedicine.9586-17", "title": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging-guided Focused Ultrasound Thalamotomy for Parkinson's Disease: A Case Report.", "journal": ["Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)", "Intern.
