MDS-UPDRS sub-scores for cardinal motor features were computed. Timed up and go mobility and walking tests were assessed in 48 subjects.Bivariate correlation coefficients between color discrimination and motor variables were significant only for the Timed up and go (RS=0.44, P=0.0018) and the MDS-UPDRS axial motor scores (RS=0.38, P=0.0068). Multiple regression confounder analysis using the Timed up and go as outcome parameter showed a significant total model (F(5,43)= 7.3, P<0.0001) with significant regressor effects for color discrimination (standardized \u03b2=0.32, t=2.6, P=0.012), global cognitive Z-score (\u03b2=-0.33, t=-2.5, P=0.018), duration of disease (\u03b2=0.26, t=1.8, P=0.038), but not for age or striatal dopaminergic binding. The color discrimination test was also a significant independent regressor in the MDS-UPDRS axial motor model (standardized \u03b2=0.29, t=2.4, P=0.022; total model t(5,43)= 6.4, P=0.0002).Color discrimination errors associate with axial motor features in PD independent of cognitive deficits, nigrostriatal dopaminergic denervation, and other confounder variables.
