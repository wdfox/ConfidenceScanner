The M458L mutation of parkin and its enzymatic effects require characterization. Therefore, we examined the enzymatic activity of Parkin with M458L mutation. We show that the M458L mutant retains its autoubiquitination potential in vitro but not in cells. Fas-associated factor 1 and p38 (substrates of Parkin) are able to bind to the M458L mutant in cells; however, these Parkin substrates are not ubiquitinated and degraded in M458L mutant-transfected cells. Moreover, M458L mutant fails to protect the mitochondria against hydrogen peroxide, leading to cell death. Considering the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in PD pathogenesis, our results imply a causative role for the M458L mutation in neurodegeneration.", "doi": "10.1002/1873-3468.12934", "title": "The M458L missense mutation disrupts the catalytic properties of Parkin.", "journal": ["FEBS letters", "FEBS Lett."]}
