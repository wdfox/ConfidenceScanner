Here, we developed PRISM (Perturbing Regulatory Interactions by Synthetic Modulators), a screening platform that uses randomized CRISPR-Cas transcription factors (crisprTFs) to globally perturb transcriptional networks. By applying PRISM to a yeast model of Parkinson's disease (PD), we identified guide RNAs (gRNAs) that modulate transcriptional networks and protect cells from alpha-synuclein (\u03b1Syn) toxicity. One gRNA identified in this screen outperformed the most protective suppressors of \u03b1Syn toxicity reported previously, highlighting PRISM's ability to identify modulators of important phenotypes. Gene expression profiling revealed genes differentially modulated by this strong protective gRNA that rescued yeast from \u03b1Syn toxicity when overexpressed. Human homologs of top-ranked hits protected against \u03b1Syn-induced cell death in a human neuronal PD model. Thus, high-throughput and unbiased perturbation of transcriptional networks via randomized crisprTFs can reveal complex biological phenotypes and effective disease modulators.", "doi": "10.1016/j.molcel.2017.09.014", "title": "Randomized CRISPR-Cas Transcriptional Perturbation Screening Reveals Protective Genes against Alpha-Synuclein Toxicity.", "journal": ["Molecular cell", "Mol.
