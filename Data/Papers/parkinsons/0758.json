Eighteen patients with PDD underwent 3 separate positron emission tomography sessions with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (for glucose metabolism), fluorinated N-3-fluoropropyl-2-beta-carboxymethoxy-3-beta-(4-iodophenyl) nortropane (for dopamine transporter density) and Pittsburgh compound-B (for beta-amyloid load). We confirmed in PDD versus normal controls, overall hypometabolism in the posterior and prefrontal brain regions accompanied with hypermetabolism in subcortical structures and the cerebellar vermis. A multivariate network analysis then revealed 3 metabolic patterns that are separately associated with cognitive performance (p\u00a0= 0.042), age (p\u00a0= 0.042), and motor symptom severity (p\u00a0=\u00a00.039). The age-related pattern's association with aging was replicated in healthy controls (p\u00a0=\u00a00.047) and patients with Alzheimer's disease (p\u00a0= 0.002). The cognition-related pattern's association with cognitive performance was observed, with a trend-level of correlation, in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (p\u00a0= 0.084) but not in patients with Alzheimer's disease (p\u00a0= 0.974). We found no association with fluorinated N-3-fluoropropyl-2-beta-carboxymethoxy-3-beta-(4-iodophenyl) nortropane and Pittsburgh compound-B positron emission tomography with patients' cognitive performance.", "doi": "10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2017.08.020", "title": "Distinct brain metabolic patterns separately associated with cognition, motor function, and aging in Parkinson's disease dementia.", "journal": ["Neurobiology of aging", "Neurobiol.
