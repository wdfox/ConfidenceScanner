We evaluated the effect of camicinal (GSK962040), a gastroprokinetic, on the absorption of l-dopa and symptoms of PD.Phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Participants were randomized to receive camicinal 50\u2009mg once-daily (n\u2009=\u200938) or placebo (n\u2009=\u200920) for 7 to 9 days.l-dopa exposure was similar with coadministration of camicinal compared to placebo. Median time to maximum l-dopa concentration was reduced, indicating more rapid absorption of l-dopa. Camicinal resulted in significant reduction in OFF time (-2.31 hours; 95% confidence interval: -3.71, -0.90), significant increase in ON time (+1.88 hours; 95% confidence interval: 0.28, 3.48) per day, and significant decrease in mean total MDS-UPDRS score (-12.5; 95% confidence interval: -19.67, -5.29). Camicinal treatment was generally well tolerated.PD symptom improvement with camicinal occurred in parallel with more rapid absorption of l-dopa. This study provides evidence of an improvement of the motor response to l-dopa in people with PD treated with camicinal 50\u2009mg once-daily compared with placebo, which will require further evaluation. \u00a9 2017 The Authors.
