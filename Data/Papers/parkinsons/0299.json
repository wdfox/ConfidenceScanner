Here, we used heterozygous reporter knock-in mice in which the first exons of the fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1) and of the C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) are replaced with fluorescent reporters to study the role of resident microglia (CX3CR1+) and infiltrating peripheral monocytes (CCR2+), respectively, in the CNS. We used an \u03b1-syn mouse model induced by viral over-expression of \u03b1-syn. We find that in vivo, expression of full-length human \u03b1-syn induces robust infiltration of pro-inflammatory CCR2+ peripheral monocytes into the substantia nigra. Genetic deletion of CCR2 prevents \u03b1-syn induced monocyte entry, attenuates MHCII expression and blocks the subsequent degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. These results demonstrate that extravasation of pro-inflammatory peripheral monocytes into the CNS plays a key role in neurodegeneration in this model of PD synucleinopathy, and suggest that peripheral monocytes may be a target of neuroprotective therapies for human PD.", "doi": "10.1016/j.expneurol.2017.11.010", "title": "Peripheral monocyte entry is required for alpha-Synuclein induced inflammation and Neurodegeneration in a model of Parkinson disease.", "journal": ["Experimental neurology", "Exp.
