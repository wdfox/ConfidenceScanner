PD occurs chiefly due to progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in nigrostriatal pathway. Largely, PD patients suffer from non-motor symptoms, such as depression, anxiety, fatigue, and sleep disorders, that needs further investigation and addressing during PD research. Depression in PD is a predominant and complex symptom, and its pathology exists extrinsic to the nigrostriatal system. This disease can\u00a0 ultimately be managed by a combination of regular physiotherapy and proper medication. Taking together the present scenario of PD, including the nature of disease, characteristics, treatment, diagnosis of the patients with PD, these outcomes were reviewed to be explored along with many speech-based solutions to PD in this study. This neurodegenerative disorder needs advancement in\u00a0 research and development which\u00a0 can help patients with PD to lead a normal life.", "doi": null, "title": "Current trends in etiology, prognosis and therapeutic aspects of Parkinson's disease: a review.", "journal": ["Acta bio-medica : Atenei Parmensis", "Acta Biomed"]}
