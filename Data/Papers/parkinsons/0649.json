Previous studies have reported an association between human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB1 and the risk of PD. There has also been growing interest in investigating whether inflammation-related genes interact with environmental factors such as smoking to influence PD risk. We performed a pooled analysis of the interaction between HLA-DRB1 and smoking in PD in 3 population-based case-control studies from Denmark and France.We included 2,056 cases and 2,723 controls from 3 PD studies (Denmark, France) that obtained information on smoking through interviews. Genotyping of the rs660895 polymorphism in the HLA-DRB1 region was based on saliva or blood DNA samples. To assess interactions, we used logistic regression with product terms between rs660895 and smoking. We performed random-effects meta-analysis of marginal associations and interactions.Both carrying rs660895-G (AG vs AA: odds ratio [OR]\u2009=\u20090.81; GG vs AA: OR\u2009=\u20090.56; p-trend\u2009=\u20090.003) and ever smoking (OR\u2009=\u20090.56, p\u2009<\u20090.001) were inversely associated with PD. A multiplicative interaction was observed between rs660895 and smoking using codominant, additive (interaction parameter\u2009=\u20091.37, p\u2009=\u20090.005), and dominant (interaction parameter\u2009=\u20091.54, p\u2009=\u20090.001) genetic models without any heterogeneity (I\u00b2\u2009=\u20090.0%); the inverse association of rs660895-(AG+GG) with PD seen in never smokers (OR\u2009=\u20090.64, p\u2009<\u20090.001) disappeared among ever smokers (OR\u2009=\u20091.00, p\u2009=\u20090.99). Similar interactions were observed when we investigated light and heavy smokers separately.Our study provides the first evidence that smoking modifies the previously reported inverse association of rs660895-G with PD, and suggests that smoking and HLA-DRB1 are involved in common pathways, possibly related to neuroinflammation.
