Correlations of alpha-synuclein among biofluids (CSF, plasma, saliva) or biomarkers (eg, beta-amyloid, tau [total, phosphorylated]) are not fully understood. The relationships of these biomarkers with PD clinical features remain unclear.BioFIND, a cross-sectional, observational study, examines clinical and biomarker characteristics in moderate-advanced PD and matched healthy controls. We compared alpha-synuclein concentrations across diagnosis, biofluids, and CSF biomarkers. Correlations of CSF biomarkers and MDS-UPDRS, motor phenotype, MoCA, and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder questionnaire scores in PD were examined.CSF alpha-synuclein was lower in PD versus controls (P\u2009=\u2009.01), controlling for age, gender, and education. Plasma and saliva alpha-synuclein did not differ between PD and controls, and alpha-synuclein did not significantly correlate among biofluids. CSF beta-amyloid1-42 was lower in PD versus controls (P\u2009<\u2009.01), and correlated weakly with MoCA recall scores (r\u2009=\u20090.23, P\u2009=\u2009.02). CSF alpha-synuclein was lower in the postural instability/gait difficulty phenotype than other motor phenotypes (P\u2009<\u2009.01). No CSF biomarkers predicted or correlated with total motor or rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder scores. CSF alpha-synuclein correlated with beta-amyloid1-42 , total-tau, and phosphorylated-tau (r\u2009=\u20090.41, 0.81, 0.43, respectively; Ps\u2009<\u2009.001).Lower CSF alpha-synuclein is associated with diagnosis and motor phenotype in moderate-advanced PD. Plasma and saliva alpha-synuclein neither correlate with CSF alpha-synuclein, nor distinguish PD from controls. CSF beta-amyloid1-42 remains a potential biomarker for cognitive impairment in PD. \u00a9 2017 The Authors.
