Misfolding and aggregation of \u03b1-synuclein is central to the pathogenesis of PD, and it has been postulated that the disease may originate in olfactory and gastrointestinal nerve terminals. The prion-like behavior of \u03b1-synuclein has been convincingly demonstrated in vitro and in animal models of PD. Lewy-type pathology have been detected in peripheral organs many years prior to PD diagnosis, and 2 independent studies have now suggested that truncal vagotomy may be protective against the disorder. Other lines of evidence are difficult to reconcile with a peripheral onset of PD, most importantly the relative scarcity of post mortem cases with isolated gastrointestinal \u03b1-synuclein pathology without concomitant CNS pathology. This Scientific Perspectives article revisits some important topics with implications for the dual-hit hypothesis. An account of the neuroanatomical pathways necessary for stereotypical \u03b1-synuclein spreading is presented. Parallels to the existing knowledge on true prion disorders, including Creutzfeld-Jakob disease, are examined. Finally, the vagotomy studies and the somewhat inconsistent findings in the growing literature on peripheral \u03b1-synuclein pathology are discussed. It is concluded that the dual-hit hypothesis remains a potential explanation for PD pathogenesis, but several issues need to be resolved before more firm conclusions can be drawn. \u00a9 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.", "doi": "10.1002/mds.27138", "title": "How does parkinson's disease begin?
