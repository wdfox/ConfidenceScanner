The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of high doses of transdermal nicotine on motor symptoms in PD.Forty PD patients were randomly assigned to a treated and untreated arm in an open-label study. Treated patients received increasing doses of nicotine to reach 90 mg/day by 11 weeks. This dosage was maintained for 28 weeks (W39) and then reduced over 6 weeks. Final evaluation was performed 6 weeks after washout. The main outcome measure was the OFF-DOPA Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor score measured on video recordings by raters blinded to the medication status of the patients.There was no significant difference in OFF-DOPA UPDRS motor scores between the nicotine-treated and non-treated groups, neither at W39 (19.4 \u00b1 9.3 vs. 21.5 \u00b1 14.2) nor considering W39 differences from baseline (-1.5 \u00b1 12.1 vs. +0.9 \u00b1 12.1). The 39-item Parkinson's disease questionnaire scores decreased in nicotine-treated patients and increased in non-treated patients, but the difference was not significant. Overall tolerability was acceptable, and 12/20 treated patients reached the maximal dosage.High doses of transdermal nicotine were tolerated, but our study failed to demonstrate significant improvement in UPDRS motor scores. Improvement in unblinded secondary outcomes (UPDRS-II, UPDRS-IV, doses of l-DOPA equivalents) suggest a possible benefit for patients treated with nicotine, which should be confirmed in larger double blind, placebo-controlled studies.", "doi": "10.1111/ene.13474", "title": "High-dose transdermal nicotine in Parkinson's disease patients: a randomized, open-label, blinded-endpoint evaluation phase 2 study.", "journal": ["European journal of neurology", "Eur.
