It is characterized by uncontrollable laughing or crying that can occur in an exaggerated manner or inappropriately to a given situation or stimuli. PBA is thought to center around preexisting neurological conditions, which include Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer disease, traumatic brain injury, and stroke. The PBA Registry Series trial was created to measure the prevalence of PBA among patients with these underlying neurological conditions. Through greater awareness, recognition, and diagnosis, treatment for patients with PBA can be improved.", "doi": null, "title": "Introduction to pseudobulbar affect: setting the stage for recognition and familiarity with this challenging disorder.", "journal": ["The American journal of managed care", "Am J Manag Care"]}
