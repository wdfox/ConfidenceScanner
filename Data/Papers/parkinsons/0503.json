Although many questions remain, recent research has advanced the understanding of this complex problem. The goal of this review is to condense new knowledge of falls in PD from prodromal to advanced disease, taking into account risk factors, assessment, and classification as well as treatment. The fundamental steps of clinical and research-based approaches to falls are described, namely, the identification of fall risk factors, clinical and instrumental methods to evaluate and classify fall risk, and the latest evidence to reduce or delay falls in PD. We summarize recent developments, the direction in which the field should be heading, and what can be recommended at this stage. We also provide a practical algorithm for clinicians.\u00a9 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.", "doi": "10.1002/mds.27195", "title": "Falls in Parkinson's disease: A complex and evolving picture.", "journal": ["Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "Mov.
