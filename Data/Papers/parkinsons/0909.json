Clinical approaches to manage PD include symptomatic therapies, serving to compensate for the effects of dopaminergic neuronal deficits, as well as more recently a move toward disease modification, with the goal of slowing or stopping disease progression. This perspective surveys the approved therapies for PD treatment as well as provides a view of the ongoing clinical approaches aimed at improving outcomes for PD patients.", "doi": "10.1016/j.bmcl.2017.07.075", "title": "Current approaches to the treatment of Parkinson's Disease.", "journal": ["Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters", "Bioorg.
