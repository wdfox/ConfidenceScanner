In mouse models of PD, antibody treatment has been shown to lower the levels of pathogenic \u03b1-syn species, including oligomers, although the mechanisms of action remain unknown. We have previously shown that astrocytes rapidly engulf \u03b1-syn oligomers that are intracellularly stored, rather than degraded, resulting in impaired mitochondria.The aim of the present study was to investigate if the accumulation of \u03b1-syn in astrocytes can be affected by \u03b1-syn oligomer-selective antibodies. Co-cultures of astrocytes, neurons, and oligodendrocytes were derived from embryonic mouse cortex and exposed to \u03b1-syn oligomers or oligomers pre-incubated with oligomer-selective antibodies.In the presence of antibodies, the astrocytes displayed an increased clearance of the exogenously added \u03b1-syn, and consequently, the \u03b1-syn accumulation in the culture was markedly reduced. Moreover, the addition of antibodies rescued the astrocytes from the oligomer-induced mitochondrial impairment.Our results demonstrate that oligomer-selective antibodies can prevent \u03b1-syn accumulation and mitochondrial dysfunction in cultured astrocytes.", "doi": "10.1186/s12974-017-1018-z", "title": "Alpha-synuclein oligomer-selective antibodies reduce intracellular accumulation and mitochondrial impairment in alpha-synuclein exposed astrocytes.", "journal": ["Journal of neuroinflammation", "J Neuroinflammation"]}
