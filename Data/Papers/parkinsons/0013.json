At the end, 37 patients completed the post-test. From those 37 patients, 16 had chosen the karate training, 9 the dance training and 12 the waiting control group. Before and after the whole training phase cognitive performance, emotional well-being and balance were measured. The results showed that both, karate and dance training groups, improved balance. Furthermore, the mood dropped only in the waiting control group receiving no training at all, whereas it remained stable in patients who attended the karate and dance group. The training adherence was higher in the karate than the dance group indicating a high acceptability in PD patients for karate. In sum, karate can have the same positive effects as dance for PD patients. Further studies with larger samples and more rigorous methodologies are required to investigate the reported effects in more detail.", "doi": "10.3389/fmed.2017.00237", "title": "Karate and Dance Training to Improve Balance and Stabilize Mood in Patients with Parkinson's Disease: A Feasibility Study.", "journal": ["Frontiers in medicine", "Front Med (Lausanne)"]}
