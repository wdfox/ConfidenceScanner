As their content represents a snapshot of the intracellular milieu, they could be exploited as biomarkers of the otherwise inaccessible brain microenvironment. In addition they may contribute to the progression of neurodegenerative disorders by facilitating the spread of misfolded proteins at distant sites or activating immune cells. This review summarizes recent advances in the study of exosomes in Parkinson's disease pathophysiology and their potential as disease biomarkers.", "doi": "10.3233/JPD-171176", "title": "A Critical Assessment of Exosomes in the Pathogenesis and Stratification of Parkinson's Disease.", "journal": ["Journal of Parkinson's disease", "J Parkinsons Dis"]}
