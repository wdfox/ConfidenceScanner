In rare inherited forms of PD, point mutations or gene multiplications mediate the formation of alpha-synuclein protein aggregates. However, in most PD cases it is presumed that the combined effects of ageing and environmental factors drive the formation of alpha-synuclein aggregates. Despite advances regarding alpha-synuclein pathobiology, the normal functions of this protein and factors that regulate its expression are not well understood. We discuss a recent study reporting that viral infection induces alpha-synuclein expression in neurons of the gastrointestinal tract. Alpha-synuclein levels increased during norovirus infection in the duodenum of children. In an in vitro paradigm, monomeric and oligomeric alpha-synuclein acted as chemoattractants for neutrophils and monocytes, and promoted the maturation of dendritic cells. This suggests that alpha-synuclein facilitates immune responses to infection. We explore the possibility that intestinal infections, and associated inflammation, place individuals at increased risk of PD by increasing alpha-synuclein levels and promoting the formation of alpha-synuclein aggregates that propagate in a prion-like fashion via the vagal nerve to the brainstem.", "doi": "10.1159/000479653", "title": "Alpha-Synuclein to the Rescue: Immune Cell Recruitment by Alpha-Synuclein during Gastrointestinal Infection.", "journal": ["Journal of innate immunity", "J Innate Immun"]}
