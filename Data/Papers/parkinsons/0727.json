They were assigned to one of the following clinical subgroups according to their predominant clinical syndrome: parkinsonism-predominant, parkinsonism+dementia, and dementia-predominant. In addition to putaminal tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity, semiquantitative scoring was used to assess substantia nigra neuronal loss. A total of 29 PD genetic risk variants were genotyped on each case.When compared with controls, tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity was reduced in Lewy body cases in the dorsolateral (79%) and ventromedial (57%) putamen. The dorsolateral region was better preserved in dementia-predominant cases than in cases with parkinsonism. Dorsolateral putaminal tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity correlated with neuronal loss in the ventrolateral substantia nigra. Genetic analyses showed no significant association of PD risk variants with putaminal tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity.The results confirm regional differences in putaminal dopaminergic degeneration and vulnerability of nigrostriatal pathway in Lewy body disorders with parkinsonism. The lack of association with PD genetic risk variants suggests that they may not be associated with quantitative endophenotypes of nigrostriatal degeneration, but more likely related to the risk of disease per se. \u00a9 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.", "doi": "10.1002/mds.27184", "title": "Regional analysis and genetic association of nigrostriatal degeneration in Lewy body disease.", "journal": ["Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "Mov.
