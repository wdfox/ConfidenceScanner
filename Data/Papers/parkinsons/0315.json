The CG received the common rehabilitation therapies, whereas the SMT group received SMT. The SMT included discrimination of temperatures, weights, textures, shapes, and objects and was performed 5 times each week for 2 weeks.Significantly reducing the error rates in the haptic object recognition test (dominant hand [DH]: F\u00a0= 15.36, P = .001, and effect size [ES] = 0.29; nondominant hand [NDH]: F = 9.33, P = .004, and ES\u00a0=\u00a00.21) and the error means in the wrist proprioception sensation test (DH: F = 9.11, P = .005, and ES\u00a0= 0.19; NDH: F = 13.04, P = .001, and ES = 0.26) and increasing matched objects in the hand active sensation test (DH: F = 12.15, P = .001, and ES = 0.24; NDH: F = 5.03, P = .03, and ES = 0.12) founded in the SMT. Also, the DH (F = 6.65, P = .01, and ES = 0.15), both hands (F = 7.61, P = .009, and ES = 0.17), and\u00a0assembly (F = 7.02, P = .01, and ES = 0.15) subtests of fine motor performance, as well as DH (F = 10.1, P = .003, and ES = 0.21) and NDH (F = 8.37, P = .006, and ES = 0.18) in upper extremity functional performance, were improved in the SMT.SMT improved hand and upper extremity sensory-motor function in patients with PD.The SMT group showed improved sensory and motor function. But these results were limited to levels 1 to 3 of the Hoehn and Yahr Scale.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jht.2017.08.001", "title": "The effect of sensory-motor training on hand and upper extremity sensory and motor function in patients with idiopathic Parkinson disease.", "journal": ["Journal of hand therapy : official journal of the American Society of Hand Therapists", "J Hand Ther"]}
