While a lot of research has been performed on vaccination against extracellular amyloid \u03b2, the focus recently shifted toward vaccination against the intracellular proteins tau and \u03b1-synuclein, with promising results in terms of protein accumulation reduction. In this review, we briefly summarize lessons to be learned from clinical vaccination trials in Alzheimer disease that target amyloid \u03b2. We then focus on tau and \u03b1-synuclein. For both proteins, we provide important data on protein immunogenicity, and put them into context with data available from both animals and human vaccination trials targeted at tau and \u03b1-synuclein. Together, we give a comprehensive overview about current clinical data, and discuss associated problems.", "doi": "10.1111/jnc.14207", "title": "Vaccination strategies in tauopathies and synucleinopathies.", "journal": ["Journal of neurochemistry", "J.
