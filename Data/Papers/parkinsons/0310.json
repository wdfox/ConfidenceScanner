The two contacts with the highest beta activity included the most efficient stimulation contact in up to 92% and that with the widest therapeutic window in 74% of cases.Local field potentials predict the most efficient stimulation contacts and may provide a useful tool to expedite the selection of the optimal contact for directional DBS. \u00a9 2017 The Authors.
