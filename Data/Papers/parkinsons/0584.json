Three patients dropped out leaving 12 patients. Recordings were conducted ON and OFF levodopa at rest. Beta (13-35Hz) peak amplitudes were extracted, compared across time points and correlated with UPDRS-III hemibody scores.Peaks in the beta frequency band (13-35Hz) in the OFF medication state were found in all hemispheres. Mean beta activity was significantly suppressed by levodopa at all recorded time points (P<0.007) and individual beta power amplitude correlated with parkinsonian motor impairment across time points and dopaminergic states (pooled data; \u03c1=0.25, P<0.001).Our results indicate that beta-activity is correlated with parkinsonian motor signs over a time period of 8months.Beta-activity may be a chronically detectable biomarker of symptom severity in PD that should be further evaluated under ongoing DBS.", "doi": "10.1016/j.clinph.2017.08.028", "title": "Long term correlation of subthalamic beta band activity with motor impairment in patients with Parkinson's disease.", "journal": ["Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "Clin Neurophysiol"]}
