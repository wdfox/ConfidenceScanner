Evidence-based recommendations on optimal stimulator settings are needed. Results from the CUSTOM-DBS study are reported, comparing 2 pulse durations.A total of 15 patients were programmed using a pulse width of 30\u2009\u00b5s (test) or 60\u2009\u00b5s (control). Efficacy and side-effect thresholds and unified PD rating scale (UPDRS) III were measured in meds-off (primary outcome). The therapeutic window was the difference between patients' efficacy and side effect thresholds.The therapeutic window was significantly larger at 30\u2009\u00b5s than 60\u2009\u00b5s (P\u2009=\u2009\u00b70009) and the efficacy (UPDRS III score) was noninferior (P\u2009=\u2009.00008).Subthalamic neurostimulation at 30\u2009\u00b5s versus 60\u2009\u00b5s pulse width is equally effective on PD motor signs, is more energy efficient, and has less likelihood of stimulation-related side effects. \u00a9 2017 The Authors.
