Therefore, we compared the 1-year follow-up outcomes of MER-guided and iMRI-guided subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery in PD patients.We conducted a review comparing PD patients who underwent MER-guided (n\u00a0= 76, group A) and iMRI-guided STN DBS surgery (n\u00a0= 61, group B) in our institution. Pre- and postoperative assessments included Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-III (UPDRS-III) score, Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), levodopa equivalent daily doses (LEDDs), and magnetic resonance images.The mean magnitudes of electrode discrepancy were x\u00a0= 1.1 \u00b1 0.2 mm, y\u00a0= 1.3 \u00b1 0.3 mm, and z\u00a0= 2.1 \u00b1 0.5 mm in group A and x\u00a0= 1.3 \u00b1 0.4 mm, y\u00a0= 1.2 \u00b1 0.2 mm, and z\u00a0= 2.5 \u00b1 0.7 mm in group B. Significant differences were not found between 2 groups for x, y, or z (P\u00a0= 0.34, P\u00a0= 0.26, and P\u00a0= 0.41, respectively). At 1 year, when levodopa was withdrawn for 12 hours, the UPDRS-III score improved by 66.3% \u00b1 13.5% in group A and 64.8% \u00b1 12.7% in group B (P\u00a0= 0.24); the PDQ-39 summary index score improved by 49.7% \u00b1 14.3% in group A and 44.1% \u00b1 12.7% in group B (P\u00a0= 0.16); the MMSE score improved by 4.2% \u00b1 2.1% in group A and 11.1% \u00b1 3.2% in group B (P\u00a0=\u00a00.43); and LEDDs decreased by 48.7% \u00b1 10.1% in group A and 56.9% \u00b1 12.0% in group B (P\u00a0= 0.32).MER and iMRI both are effective ways to ensure adequate electrode placement in DBS surgery, but there is no superiority between both techniques, at least in terms of 1-year follow-up outcomes.", "doi": "10.1016/j.wneu.2017.08.077", "title": "Microelectrode Recording-Guided Versus Intraoperative Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Guided Subthalamic Nucleus Deep Brain Stimulation Surgery for Parkinson Disease: A 1-Year Follow-Up Study.", "journal": ["World neurosurgery", "World Neurosurg"]}
