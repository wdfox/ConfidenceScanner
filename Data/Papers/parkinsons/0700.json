Increasing evidence has suggested that the GABAergic neurotransmitter system is involved in the pathogenesis of PD.To evaluate the differences of GABA levels between PD motor subtypes using MEscher-GArwood Point Resolved Spectroscopy (MEGA-PRESS).COHORT.: SUBJECTS: PD patients were classified into PIGD (n\u2009=\u200913) and TD groups (n\u2009=\u20099); 16 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were also recruited. All subjects were right-handed.All subjects underwent an magnetic resonance spectroscopy scan including MEGA-PRESS at 3.0T.The detected GABA signal also contains signal from macromolecules (MM) and homocarnosine, so it is referred to as GABA+. GABA\u2009+\u2009levels and Creatine (Cr) levels were quantified in the left basal ganglia (BG) using Gannet 2.0 by Tao Gong.Differences in GABA\u2009+\u2009levels between the three groups were analyzed using analysis of covariance. The relationship between GABA levels and a unified PD rating scale (UPDRS) was also analyzed.GABA\u2009+\u2009levels were significantly lower in left BG regions of PD patients compared with healthy controls (P < 0.001). In PD patients, the GABA concentration was lower in the TD group than the PIGD group (P\u2009=\u20090.019). Cr levels in PIGD and TD were lower than controls (P\u2009=\u20090.020; P\u2009=\u20090.002). A significant negative correlation was found in PIGD between GABA levels and UPDRS (r\u2009=\u2009-0.572, P\u2009=\u20090.041), while no correlation was found in TD (r\u2009=\u2009-0.339, P\u2009=\u20090.372).Low BG GABA levels in PD patients, and differences between PIGD/TD patients, suggest that GABAergic dysfunction may play an important role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease.1 Technical Efficacy: Stage 2 J.
