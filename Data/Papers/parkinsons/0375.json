Negative correlation was found between the subjective assessment of the severity of speech disorder, breathing at rest, and sentence comprehension.Although we observed correlation between the subjective perception of certain speech disorders of patients with Parkinson disease and the objective assessment carried out by means of the Frenchay Dysarthria Assessment scale, the subjects did not believe the disorders had a significant impact on the quality of speech. Negative results of an examination do not necessarily reflect the subjective perception of the decline in the functioning of the articulatory organs. It should be assumed that lack of correlation between the subjective perception measured using Voice Handicap Index and the objective Frenchay Dysarthria-based assessment of the performance of the articulatory organs may result from a good adaptation to the progressive changes.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jvoice.2017.08.018", "title": "Differences between Subjective and Objective Assessment of Speech Deficiency in Parkinson Disease.", "journal": ["Journal of voice : official journal of the Voice Foundation", "J Voice"]}
