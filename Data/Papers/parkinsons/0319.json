The investigated oxidative parameters were gender and Hoehn and Yahr related. Significant association of higher Hoehn and Yahr scores was observed for malondialdehyde (p = 0.01) and prooxidant-antioxidant balance (p = 0.02). Relation between oxidant-antioxidant status was further supported by observed positive correlation between 4-hydroxynonenal (p = 0.04) and prooxidant-antioxidant balance (p = 0.03). Finally, the multivariate analysis indicated that prooxidant-antioxidant balance and malondialdehyde were partially determined by gender (10.6% and 7.6%) and Hoehn and Yahr scores (13.6% and 18.8%), while Hoehn and Yahr scores contributed to the variance of advanced oxidation protein products with 13.2%.Our results indicate the higher level of oxidative stress (oxidant-antioxidant imbalance) and possible relation of several markers with gender and disease stage in patients with Parkinson's disease. The analyzed markers could be used to specify the severity of oxidative stress; however, their potential value should be analyzed in further studies.", "doi": "10.1080/00207454.2017.1403916", "title": "Prooxidant-antioxidant balance, advanced oxidation protein products and lipid peroxidation in Serbian patients with Parkinson's disease.", "journal": ["The International journal of neuroscience", "Int.
