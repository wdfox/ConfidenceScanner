We propose here that those genes may only represent the tip of an iceberg of regulatory effects and do not necessary reflect disease relevance. To usefully interpret a risk locus, one needs to consider 5 dimensions of information, which represent the three-dimensional structure of chromatin (dimensions #1- 3), which is locally variable across time (dimension #4), and, most importantly, dependent on cell type and context (dimension #5).", "doi": "10.3233/JPD-171256", "title": "The Five Dimensions of Parkinson's Disease Genetic Risk.", "journal": ["Journal of Parkinson's disease", "J Parkinsons Dis"]}
