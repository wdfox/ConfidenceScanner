Cdk5, a serine/threonine kinase, is activated by p35 or p39 and phosphorylates multiple signaling components of various pathways, including cAMP/PKA signaling. Here, we review the recent literature on the interaction between Cdk5 and cAMP/PKA signaling and their role in the mediation of CNS functions and neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases.", "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-58811-7_3", "title": "Interaction of Cdk5 and cAMP/PKA Signaling in the Mediation of Neuropsychiatric and Neurodegenerative Diseases.", "journal": ["Advances in neurobiology", "Adv Neurobiol"]}
