We evaluated the olfaction of study participants with the Brief Smell Identification Test (BSIT) in 1999-2000. We retrospectively adjudicated PD cases identified through August 31, 2012, using multiple data sources. We used multivariable Cox models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).During an average of 9.8 years of follow-up, we identified a total of 42 incident PD cases, including 30 white and 12 black participants. Overall, poor sense of smell, as indicated by a lower BSIT score, was associated with higher risk of PD. Compared with the highest tertile of BSIT (t3), the HR was 1.3 (95% CI 0.5-3.6) for the second tertile (t2) and 4.8 (95% CI 2.0-11.2) for the lowest tertile (t1) (ptrend < 0.00001). Further analyses revealed significant associations for incident PD in both the first 5 years of follow-up (HRt1/[t2+t3] 4.2, 95% CI 1.7-10.8) and thereafter (HRt1/[t2+t3] 4.1, 95% CI 1.7-9.8). This association appeared to be stronger in white (HRt1/[t2+t3] 4.9, 95% CI 2.3-10.5) than in black participants (HRt1/[t2+t3] 2.5, 95% CI 0.8-8.1), and in men (HRt1/[t2+t3] 5.4, 95% CI 2.3-12.9) than in women (HRt1/[t2+t3] 2.9, 95% CI 1.1-7.8).Poor olfaction predicts PD in short and intermediate terms; the possibility of stronger associations among men and white participants warrants further investigation.", "doi": "10.1212/WNL.0000000000004382", "title": "Olfaction and incident Parkinson disease in US white and black older adults.", "journal": ["Neurology", "Neurology"]}
