We randomly and double-blindedly applied 10- to 50-\u00b5s pulse widths. The principal outcome was the therapeutic window (difference between the amplitude thresholds for visible muscle contraction and for best rigidity control). The secondary outcome was the charge per pulse (which reflects the efficiency of the stimulation) needed to control rigidity. Two-way analysis of variance and pairwise t tests were applied.The therapeutic window widened when the pulse width shortened (r\u2009=\u2009-0.45; P\u2009<\u20090.001), and charge per pulse was reduced (P\u2009<\u20090.05).This randomized, double-blind study showed that shorter pulse widths widen the therapeutic window of STN-DBS in PD without increasing the electrical charge required to obtain the same acute clinical benefit. \u00a9 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.", "doi": "10.1002/mds.27265", "title": "Short pulse width in subthalamic stimulation in Parkinson's disease: a randomized, double-blind study.", "journal": ["Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "Mov.
