Because both oxidative stress and protein aggregation have damaging effects on neurons, activation of the Nrf2 signaling should be beneficial against neurodegeneration. In this study, we report a novel synthetic morpholine-containing chalcone KMS99220 that confers neuroprotection. It showed high binding affinity to the Nrf2 inhibitory protein Keap-1 and increased nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and gene expression of the antioxidant enzymes heme oxygenase-1, NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1, and the catalytic and modifier subunits of glutamate-cysteine ligase in dopaminergic CATH.a cells. KMS99220 also increased expression of the proteasome subunits PSMB5, PSMB7, PSMB8 and PSMA1, and the respective chymotrypsin and trypsin-like proteasomal enzyme activities, and reduced \u03b1-synuclein aggregate in GFP-\u03b1-syn A53T-overexpressing cells. KMS99220 exhibited a favorable pharmacokinetic profile with excellent bioavailability and metabolic stability, did not interfere with activities of the cytochrome p450 isotypes, and showed no apparent in\u00a0vivo toxicity when administered up to 2000\u00a0mg/kg. In 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-treated mice, oral administration of KMS99220 prevented degeneration of the nigral dopaminergic neurons, induced the Nrf2 target genes, and effectively prevented the associated motor deficits. These results suggest KMS99220 as a potential candidate for therapy against Parkinson's disease.", "doi": "10.1016/j.neuint.2017.11.006", "title": "Activation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway and neuroprotection of nigral dopaminergic neurons by a novel synthetic compound KMS99220.", "journal": ["Neurochemistry international", "Neurochem.
