We utilize a standard speech signal feature set, which contains 6373 static features as functionals of low-level descriptor (LLD) contours, and select the most informative ones using the maximal relevance and minimal redundancy based on correlations (mRMRC) criteria. Then, we evaluate performance of Gaussian mixture regression (GMR) and support vector regression (SVR) on estimating the third subscale of UPDRS, i.e., UPDRS: motor subscale (UPDRS-III). Among the most informative features, a list of features are selected after redundancy reduction. The selected features depict that LLDs providing information about spectrum flatness, spectral distribution of energy, and hoarseness of voice are the most important ones for estimating UPDRS-III. Moreover, the most informative statistical functions are related to range, maximum, minimum and standard deviation of LLDs, which is an evidence of the muscle weakness due to the PD. Furthermore, GMR outperforms SVR on compact feature sets while the performance of SVR improves by increasing number of features.", "doi": "10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037685", "title": "Speech features for telemonitoring of Parkinson's disease symptoms.", "journal": ["Conference proceedings : ...
