Materials and Methods. Thirty-six patients were randomized into 2 groups: the M\u00e9zi\u00e8res treatment group and the control group (home exercise group). The primary outcome was the improvement in balance per the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and the trunk flexibility of the back for the anterior flexion trunk test. Also, we evaluated pain, gait balance for the Functional Gait Assessment (FGA), disease-related disability for the Modified Parkinson's Activity Scale and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), the quality of life, and the functional exercise capacity. All the measures were evaluated at baseline (T0), at the end of the rehabilitative program (T1), and at the 12-week follow-up (T2). Results. In the M\u00e9zi\u00e8res group, the BBS (p < .001) and trunk flexion test (p < .001) improved significantly at T1 and remained the same at T2. Between groups, significant changes were reported in FGA (p = .027) and UPDRS Total (p = .007) at T1 and in FGA (p = .03) at T2. Conclusion. The M\u00e9zi\u00e8res approach is efficacious in improving the flexibility of the trunk and balance in PD patients.", "doi": "10.1155/2017/2762987", "title": "Impact of M\u00e9zi\u00e8res Rehabilitative Method in Patients with Parkinson's Disease: A Randomized Controlled Trial.", "journal": ["Parkinson's disease", "Parkinsons Dis"]}
