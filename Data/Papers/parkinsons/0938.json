Behavioural complications, including depression, anxiety, apathy, impulse control disorder and psychosis, together have a large impact on PD patient's quality of life. Many neuroimaging studies using PET, SPECT and MRI techniques have been conducted to study the underlying neural mechanisms of PD pathogenesis and pathophysiology in relation to its behavioural complications. This review will survey these PET, SPECT and MRI studies to describe the current understanding of the neuro-chemical, functional and structural changes associated with behavioural complications in PD patients.", "doi": "10.1007/s11682-017-9764-1", "title": "Imaging behavioural complications of Parkinson's disease.", "journal": ["Brain imaging and behavior", "Brain Imaging Behav"]}
