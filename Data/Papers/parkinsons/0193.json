The retromer complex is a critical coordinator of endosomal dynamics and has functional roles in multiple cellular processes through sorting cargoes from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) or to the plasma membrane. Mammalian retromer comprises a core Vps26-Vps35-Vps29 trimer and associates with a range of proteins to generate endosomal tubular-vesicular carriers. Alterations in retromer function or its molecular organization have been a rising risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD). Although genetic evidence has shown several variants within retromer in late-onset PD cases, the exact molecular machineries by which retromer variants induce the development of PD are still not completely elucidated. In this Review, we will focus on the functional roles of retromer in neuronal health, summarize advances in defining the cellular pathological phenotype caused by retromer deficiency or PD-linked retromer variants and discuss the potential clues of how retromer deregulation may contribute to PD pathogenesis.", "doi": "10.1002/1873-3468.12931", "title": "The functional roles of retromer in Parkinson's disease.", "journal": ["FEBS letters", "FEBS Lett."]}
