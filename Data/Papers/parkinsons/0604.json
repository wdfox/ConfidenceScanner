Neuroprotective drugs could potentially slow down disease progression if used at early stages. Previously, we have reported an altered content of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the breath of rats following a 50% reduction in striatal dopamine (DA) content induced by 6-hydroxydopamine. We now report on the difference in the breath-print and content of VOCs between rats with mild and severe lesions of DA neurons, serotonergic neuronal lesions, and transgenic (Tg) rats carrying the PD-producing A53T mutation of the SNCA (\u03b1-synuclein) gene. The Tg rats had an increased content of 3-octen-1-ol and 4-chloro-3-methyl phenol in blood, while in brain tissue, hexanal, hexanol, and 2,3-octanedione were present in controls but absent in Tg rats. Levels of 1-heptyl-2-methyl cyclopropane were increased in brain tissue of Tg rats. The data confirm the potential of breath analysis for detection of human idiosyncratic as well as autosomal dominant PD.", "doi": "10.1021/acschemneuro.7b00318", "title": "Altered Volatile Organic Compound Profile in Transgenic Rats Bearing A53T Mutation of Human \u03b1-Synuclein: Comparison with Dopaminergic and Serotonergic Denervation.", "journal": ["ACS chemical neuroscience", "ACS Chem Neurosci"]}
