Vitamin D levels were compared between subjects at high risk for PD (hyposmia and dopamine transporter scan deficit) versus all others and examined for correlations with dopaminergic system integrity.Mean vitamin D levels did not differ between groups, with a level of 27.8 ng/mL (standard deviation = 12.0) in the high-risk group versus 24.7 ng/mL (standard deviation = 9.0) in all others (P = 0.09). Vitamin D levels did not associate with putaminal dopamine transporter uptake.Our data from the asymptomatic Parkinson Associated Risk Syndrome cohort do not support the hypothesis that chronic vitamin D insufficiency threatens dopaminergic system integrity, contributing to PD pathogenesis. \u00a9 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.", "doi": "10.1002/mds.27127", "title": "Vitamin D in the Parkinson Associated Risk Syndrome (PARS) study.", "journal": ["Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "Mov.
