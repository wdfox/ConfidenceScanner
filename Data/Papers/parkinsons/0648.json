We assessed whether the MER-determined STN width is a predictor of postoperative Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) improvement.Records were reviewed for patients who underwent single-sided STN DBS placement for Parkinson disease between 2005 and 2010 at the UAB Medical Center. Reviews of preoperative and 3-month postoperative UPDRS part III, intraoperative MER records, and postoperative MRI scans were conducted.The final cohort consisted of 73 patients (mean age 59 \u00b1 9.7 years, length of disease 13 \u00b1 9.7 years). STN widths were defined as depths associated with increased background activity and motor-driven, spiking action potentials on MER. The mean contralateral UPDRS improvement was 58% (\u00b1 24). The mean STN width was 5.1 mm (\u00b1 1.6, min = 0.0, max = 8.7). No significant relationship between STN width and UPDRS improvement was found, with and without AC-PC normalization (R2 < 0.05).This analysis raises questions about seeking the maximal electrophysiological width of STN as a proxy for optimal outcome in DBS for PD. We suggest this strategy for DBS placement in Parkinson disease be subject to more robust prospective investigation.", "doi": "10.1159/000478023", "title": "The Relationship of Electrophysiologic Subthalamic Nucleus Length as a Predictor of Outcomes in Deep Brain Stimulation for Parkinson Disease.", "journal": ["Stereotactic and functional neurosurgery", "Stereotact Funct Neurosurg"]}
