Acute changes in hemodynamics may produce rare but severe complications such as intracranial bleeding, transient ischemic stroke and myocardium infarction. Therefore, this retrospective study attempts to determine the incidence of hemodynamic perturbances (rate) and related risk factors in patients undergoing DBS surgery. Materials and Methods: After institutional approval, all patients undergoing DBS surgery for the past 10 years were recruited for this study. Demographic characteristics, procedural characteristics and intraoperative hemodynamic changes were noted. Event rate was calculated and the effect of all the variables on hemodynamic perturbations was analyzed by regression model. Results: Total hemodynamic adverse events during DBS surgery was 10.8 (0-42) and treated in 57% of cases. Conclusion: Among all the perioperative variables, the baseline blood pressure including systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure was found to have highly significant effect on these intraoperative hemodynamic perturbations.", "doi": "10.3389/fnins.2017.00477", "title": "Hemodynamic Perturbations in Deep Brain Stimulation Surgery: First Detailed Description.", "journal": ["Frontiers in neuroscience", "Front Neurosci"]}
