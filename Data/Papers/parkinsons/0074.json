We examined the relationship between structural states of intrinsically-disordered wild-type and mutant \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1SN) and amyloidogenesis on two-types of model membranes. Highly-unstructured wild-type \u03b1SN (\u03b1SNWT) and a C-terminally-truncated mutant lacking negative charges (\u03b1SN103) formed amyloid fibrils on both types of membranes, the model membrane mimicking presynaptic vesicles (Mimic membrane) and the model membrane of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC membrane). Unstructured \u03b1SNWT and \u03b1SN103 both bound to Mimic membranes in a helical conformation with similar binding affinity. Promotion and then inhibition of amyloidogenesis of \u03b1SNWT were observed as the concentration of Mimic lipids increased. We explain this by the two-state binding model: at lower lipid concentrations, binding of \u03b1SNWT to membranes enhances amyloidogenicity by increasing the local concentration of membrane-bound \u03b1SN and so promoting amyloid nucleation; at higher lipid concentrations, membrane-bound \u03b1SNWT is actually in a sense diluted by increasing the number of model membranes, which blocks amyloid fibrillation due to an insufficient bound population for productive nucleation. Meanwhile, \u03b1SN103 formed amyloid fibrils over the whole concentration of Mimic lipids used here without inhibition, revealing the importance of helical structures for binding affinity and negatively charged unstructured C-terminal region for modulating amyloidogenesis. We propose that membrane binding-induced initial conformations of \u03b1SN, its overall charge states, and the population of membrane-bound \u03b1SN are key determinants of amyloidogenesis on membranes.", "doi": "10.1016/j.bbamem.2017.12.011", "title": "Membrane-induced initial structure of \u03b1-synuclein control its amyloidogenesis on model membranes.", "journal": ["Biochimica et biophysica acta", "Biochim.
