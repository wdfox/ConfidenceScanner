Therefore, systemic and cellular copper homeostasis is tightly regulated, but dysregulation of copper homeostasis may occur in disease states, resulting either in copper deficiency or copper overload and toxicity. This chapter will give an overview on the biological roles of copper and of the mechanisms involved in copper uptake, storage, and distribution. In addition, we will describe potential mechanisms of the cellular toxicity of copper and copper oxide nanoparticles. Finally, we will summarize the current knowledge on the connection of copper toxicity with neurodegenerative diseases.", "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-60189-2_16", "title": "Neurotoxicity of Copper.", "journal": ["Advances in neurobiology", "Adv Neurobiol"]}
