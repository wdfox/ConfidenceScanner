Several lines of evidence from the study of sporadic, familial and pharmacologically induced forms of human Parkinson's disease also suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction plays an important role in disease progression. Although many functions have been proposed for \u03b1-synuclein, emerging data from human and animal models of Parkinson's disease highlight a role for \u03b1-synuclein in the control of neuronal mitochondrial dynamics. Here, we review the \u03b1-synuclein structural, biophysical and biochemical properties that influence relevant mitochondrial dynamic processes such as fusion-fission, transport and clearance. Drawing on current evidence, we propose that \u03b1-synuclein contributes to the mitochondrial defects that are associated with the pathology of this common and progressive neurodegenerative disease.", "doi": "10.1242/dmm.026294", "title": "Mitochondrial dynamics in Parkinson's disease: a role for \u03b1-synuclein?", "journal": ["Disease models & mechanisms", "Dis Model Mech"]}
