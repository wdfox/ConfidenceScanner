Materials and Methods In this prospective study, MR spectroscopic imaging datasets were acquired at 3 T after written informed consent was obtained. Translational and rotational head movement, frequency, and B0 shim were determined with an integrated volumetric navigator. Head motion patterns and imager instability were investigated in 33 young healthy control subjects (mean age \u00b1 standard deviation, 31 years \u00b1 5), 34 older healthy control subjects (mean age, 67 years \u00b1 8), 34 subjects with MCI (mean age, 72 years \u00b1 5), and 44 patients with PD (mean age, 64 years \u00b1 8). Spectral quality was assessed by means of region-of-interest analysis. Group differences were evaluated with Bonferroni-corrected Mann-Whitney tests. Results Three patients with PD and four subjects with MCI were excluded because of excessive head motion (ie, > 0.8 mm translation per repetition time of 1.6 seconds throughout >10 minutes). Older control subjects, patients with PD, and subjects with MCI demonstrated 1.5, 2, and 2.5 times stronger head movement, respectively, than did young control subjects (1.79 mm \u00b1 0.77) (P < .001). Of young control subjects, older control subjects, patients with PD, and subjects with MCI, 6%, 35%, 38%, and 51%, respectively, moved more than 3 mm during the MR spectroscopic imaging acquisition of approximately 20 minutes. The predominant movements were head nodding and \"sliding out\" of the imager. Frequency changes were 1.1- and 1.4-fold higher in patients with PD (P = .007) and subjects with MCI (P < .001), respectively, and B0 shim changes were 1.3-, 1.5-, and 1.9-fold higher in older control subjects (P = .005), patients with PD (P < .001), and patients with MCI (P < .001), respectively, compared with those of young control subjects (12.59 Hz \u00b1 2.49, 3.61 Hz \u00b7 cm-1 \u00b1 1.25). Real-time correction provided high spectral quality in all four groups (signal-to-noise ratio >15, Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bounds < 20%). Conclusion Real-time motion and B0 monitoring provides valuable information about motion patterns and B0 field variations in subjects with different predispositions for head movement. Immediate correction improves data quality, particularly in patients who have difficulty avoiding movement. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.", "doi": "10.1148/radiol.2017170744", "title": "Real-time Correction of Motion and Imager Instability Artifacts during 3D \u03b3-Aminobutyric Acid-edited MR Spectroscopic Imaging.", "journal": ["Radiology", "Radiology"]}
