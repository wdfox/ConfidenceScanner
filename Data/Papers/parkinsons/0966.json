DAT SPECT showed decreased uptake in the striatum in all four patients who were scanned, including one patient without parkinsonism. When patterns of uptake were compared to those with Parkinson's disease, most of the patients had minimal reduction of uptake in the putamen.DAT SPECT is expected to be useful in differentiating SCA2 from Parkinson's disease, making an early diagnosis, and allowing early therapeutic intervention.", "doi": "10.1016/j.parkreldis.2017.08.012", "title": "DAT SPECT may have diagnostic value in prodromal SCA2 patients with parkinsonism.", "journal": ["Parkinsonism & related disorders", "Parkinsonism Relat.
