The A allele of the functional variant rs13306560 in its promoter region has been liked to decreased transactivation capacity. Therefore, we sought to determine a possible association of the rs13306560 and SPD.In total, 237 individuals were genotyped, 113 patients with SPD diagnosed according to the Queen Square Brain Bank criteria and 124 neurologically healthy controls. Genotyping was performed using TaqMan probes for the rs13306560 and real-time PCR.The A allelle was associated to protection in SPD, under the dominant model, (OR=0.22, C.I.=[0.048-1.080], p=0.04), nevertheless, after logistic regression analysis with adjustment for gender, resulted only in a trend (Exp (\u03b2)=0.211, [I.C. 95.0%, 0.042-1.057], p=0.058).Although further studies are needed, our data suggest an important role of the MTHFR gene variants in the fine-tuning regulation of one-carbon metabolism in the brain.", "doi": null, "title": "Analysis of the rs13306560 functional variant in the promoter region of the MTHFR gene in sporadic Parkinson\u00b4s disease.", "journal": ["Neuro endocrinology letters", "Neuro Endocrinol.
