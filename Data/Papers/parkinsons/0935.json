We conducted a trial of selegiline monotherapy for early PD.In this 12-week controlled phase III trial, a total of 292 subjects were randomized to receive placebo (n = 146) (full analysis set 140) or selegiline (n = 146) (full analysis set 139). The primary outcome measure was the change in the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale part I + II + III total score from baseline to the final visit. Other secondary measures and a safety profile were evaluated.Selegiline monotherapy reduced the primary outcome measure by -6.26 \u00b1 7.86 compared with the placebo -3.14 \u00b1 6.98 (mean \u00b1 SD, P = 0.0005 by analysis of covariance).
