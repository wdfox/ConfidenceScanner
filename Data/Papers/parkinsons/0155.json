Materials and Methods Between March 2014 and April 2015, 18 consecutively recruited patients with iRBD were evaluated with 3.0-T SW imaging and iodine 123-2\u03b2-carbomethoxy-3\u03b2-(4-iodophenyl)-N-(3-fluoropropyl)-nortropane (123I-FP-CIT) single photon emission computed tomography and compared with 18 healthy subjects and 18 patients with Parkinson disease (PD). Two readers blinded to clinical diagnosis independently assessed the images. 123I-FP-CIT uptake ratios were compared by using the Kruskal-Wallis test, and intra- and interobserver agreements were assessed with the Cohen \u03ba. The synucleinopathy conversion according to NH status was evaluated in patients with iRBD after follow-up. Results NH was intact in seven patients with iRBD and lost in 11. The 123I-FP-CIT uptake ratios were comparable between those with intact NH (mean, 3.22 \u00b1 0.47) and healthy subjects (mean, 3.37 \u00b1 0.47) (P = .495). The 123I-FP-CIT uptake ratios in the 11 patients with iRBD and NH loss (mean, 2.48 \u00b1 0.44) were significantly lower than those in healthy subjects (mean, 3.37 \u00b1 0.47; P < .001) but higher than those in patients with PD (mean, 1.80 \u00b1 0.33; P < .001). The intra- and interobserver agreements were excellent (\u03ba > 0.9). Five patients with iRBD and NH loss developed symptoms of parkinsonism or dementia 18 months after neuroimaging. Conclusion NH loss at 3.0-T SW imaging may be a promising marker for short-term synucleinopathy risk in iRBD. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.", "doi": "10.1148/radiol.2017162486", "title": "Loss of Substantia Nigra Hyperintensity at 3.0-T MR Imaging in Idiopathic REM Sleep Behavior Disorder: Comparison with 123I-FP-CIT SPECT.", "journal": ["Radiology", "Radiology"]}
