Using the UK General Practice Research Database, presence of polyneuropathy in the previous 3 years was assessed. Of 5089 PD patients and 19,897 controls, polyneuropathy was confirmed in 15 PD patients (0.29%) and 24 controls (0.12%). Polyneuropathy prevalence was 2.4-fold higher in PD patients than controls. In this observational study, PD patients had a higher prevalence of preexisting polyneuropathy that cannot be explained by adverse effects of antiparkinsonian drugs.", "doi": "10.3233/JPD-161057", "title": "Increased Prevalence of Polyneuropathy in\u00a0Parkinson's Disease Patients: An\u00a0Observational Study.", "journal": ["Journal of Parkinson's disease", "J Parkinsons Dis"]}
