The pathological hallmark of PD is intercellular inclusions termed Lewy Bodies, composed mainly of \u03b1-Synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) protein. Recent findings have shown that \u03b1-Syn can be transmitted from cell to cell, suggesting an important role of microglia, as the main scavenger cells of the brain, in clearing \u03b1-Syn. We previously reported that the knock down (KD) of DJ-1 in microglia increased cells' neurotoxicity to dopaminergic neurons. Here, we discovered that \u03b1-Syn significantly induced elevated secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 and a significant dose-dependent elevation in the production of nitric oxide in DJ-1 KD microglia, compared to control microglia. We further investigated the ability of DJ-1 KD microglia to uptake and degrade soluble \u03b1-Syn, and discovered that DJ-1 KD reduces cell-surface lipid raft expression in microglia and impairs their ability to uptake soluble \u03b1-Syn. Autophagy is an important mechanism for degradation of intracellular proteins and organelles. We discovered that DJ-1 KD microglia exhibit an impaired autophagy-dependent degradation of p62 and LC3 proteins, and that manipulation of autophagy had less effect on \u03b1-Syn uptake and clearance in DJ-1 KD microglia, compared to control microglia. Further studies of the link between DJ-1, \u03b1-Syn uptake and autophagy may provide useful insights into the role of microglia in the etiology of the PD.", "doi": "10.1111/jnc.14222", "title": "DJ-1 deficiency impairs autophagy and reduces alpha-synuclein phagocytosis by microglia.", "journal": ["Journal of neurochemistry", "J.
