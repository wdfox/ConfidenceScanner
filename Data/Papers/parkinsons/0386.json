We aim to describe the effect of NPS and MCI on each other and on QoL.Sixteen MCI and 37 non-MCI PD patients completed different self-assessment questionnaires including the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39), the Beck Depression Inventory (BD), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and the Self-Report Manic Inventory (SRMI). Linear regression with stepwise elimination was used to select the significant predictors of QoL and to control for confounding factors.The significant linear regression model (R2 = 0.68, p \u2264 0.01) revealed significant effects of MCI (p = 0.03), BDI (p \u2264 0.01), BAI (p \u2264 0.01), age (p = 0.03), a trend of SRMI (p = 0.06), and disease duration (p = 0.08) on QoL.MCI, anxiety, depression, and age decrease QoL in patients with PD. NPS has the main influence in the prediction of QoL in patients with PD, whereas MCI is only of minor importance.", "doi": "10.1159/000478849", "title": "Influence of Mild Cognitive Impairment, Depression, and Anxiety on the Quality of Life of Patients with Parkinson Disease.", "journal": ["Dementia and geriatric cognitive disorders extra", "Dement Geriatr Cogn Dis Extra"]}
