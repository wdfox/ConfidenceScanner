We previously showed that Ser65 phosphorylation results in a conformational change in which Ub adopts a dynamic equilibrium between the known, common Ub conformation and a distinct, second conformation wherein the last \u03b2-strand is retracted to extend the Ser65 loop and shorten the C-terminal tail. We show using chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) nuclear magnetic resonance experiments that a similar, C-terminally retracted (Ub-CR) conformation also exists at low population in wild-type Ub. Point mutations in the moving \u03b25 and neighbouring \u03b2-strands shift the Ub/Ub-CR equilibrium. This enabled functional studies of the two states, and we show that while the Ub-CR conformation is defective for conjugation, it demonstrates improved binding to PINK1 through its extended Ser65 loop, and is a superior PINK1 substrate. Together our data suggest that PINK1 utilises a lowly populated yet more suitable Ub-CR conformation of Ub for efficient phosphorylation. Our findings could be relevant for many kinases that phosphorylate residues in folded protein domains.", "doi": "10.15252/embj.201797876", "title": "An invisible ubiquitin conformation is required for efficient phosphorylation by PINK1.", "journal": ["The EMBO journal", "EMBO J."]}
