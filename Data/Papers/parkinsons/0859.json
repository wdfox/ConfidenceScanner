A spread of DBS current to adjacent cortico-ponto-cerebellar pathways might be responsible. In contrast to the few cases published previously, there was no pre-existing additional lesion that would have favoured occurrence of PC. Treating physicians should be aware of DBS-induced PC.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jocn.2017.08.020", "title": "Pathological crying induced by deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus in Parkinson's disease.", "journal": ["Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia", "J Clin Neurosci"]}
