In vivo study, 48 male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into four groups. OECs/VMCs and OECs-Nurr1-Ngn2/VMCs groups were transplanted with 2\u00d7105 cells each of OECs or OECs-Nurr1-Ngn2 and VMCs into the right striatum one week after a unilateral 6-OHDA lesion. Control and PD groups were injected with 0.9% NaCl and 0.2% ascorbic acid into the same region. Rotational behavior was determined at 2, 4, 6 and 8weeks after injection or implantation in all groups. Neuronal differentiation markers, oxidative stress- and apoptosis-related indicators were detected at 8weeks post-grafting.OECs-Nurr1-Ngn2 increased the viability of PC12 cells, inhibited oxidative stress and apoptosis, and these effects could be reversed by pre-treatment of k252a, a TrkB receptor inhibitor. The behavioral deficits of PD rat were ameliorated by the transplantation of OECs-Nurr1-Ngn2/VMCs.These results suggest that OECs-Nurr1-Ngn2 exhibits substantial neuroprotective, anti-oxidant, and anti-apoptotic effects against PD via the up-regulation of the neurotrophic factor-TrkB pathway.", "doi": "10.1016/j.lfs.2017.12.038", "title": "Neuroprotective effect of olfactory ensheathing cells co-transfected with Nurr1 and Ngn2 in both in vitro and in vivo models of Parkinson's disease.", "journal": ["Life sciences", "Life Sci."]}
