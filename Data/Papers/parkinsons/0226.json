Patients were followed until PD diagnosis, death, censoring, or end of follow-up 30 November 2013. Using Cox regression, we computed hazard ratios for PD and corresponding 95% confidence intervals, adjusting for age and sex by study design, and potential confounders.We identified 100 and 568 patients diagnosed with PD among the tonsillectomy and general population comparison cohort, respectively, finding similar risks of PD (adjusted hazard ratio\u2009=\u20090.95 [95% confidence interval: 0.76-1.19]; for\u2009>\u200920 years' follow-up (adjusted hazard ratio\u2009=\u20090.96 [95% confidence interval: 0.64-1.41]).Tonsillectomy is not associated with risk of PD, especially early-onset PD. \u00a9 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.", "doi": "10.1002/mds.27253", "title": "Tonsillectomy and risk of Parkinson's disease: A danish nationwide population-based cohort study.", "journal": ["Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "Mov.
