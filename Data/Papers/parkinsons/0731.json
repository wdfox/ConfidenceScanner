This study sought to identify a neurochemical profile in multiple regions of the PD brain and healthy controls by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS). We aimed to track changes of the brain neurochemical, quantify neuronal loss, and further determine the diagnostic value of 1H-MRS.PD patients and healthy controls recruited from Second Affiliated Hospital of Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, southern China, underwent 1H-MRS. Chemical information was obtained for ratios of N-acetylaspartate to creatine (NAA/Cr), NAA to choline (NAA/Cho), and Cho to Cr for substantia nigra, globus pallidus, prefrontal lobe, hippocampus, cuneus gyrus, and dorsal thalamus regions.Compared to the 20 healthy controls (12 male, age 58.75\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.03\u00a0years), the 42 patients (21 male, age 61.60\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.40\u00a0years) showed lower NAA/Cr and NAA/Cho ratios in substantia nigra, globus pallidus, prefrontal lobe, hippocampus, cuneus gyrus and dorsal thalamus regions (p\u00a0<\u00a0.01); NAA/Cr and NAA/Cho ratios were reduced for both patients with unilateral and mild/no cognitive impairment (p\u00a0<\u00a0.01); Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale score was inversely correlated with NAA/Cr ratios in the substantia nigra (r\u00a0=\u00a0-.32; p\u00a0=\u00a0.042).NAA/Cr and NAA/Cho ratios may be useful metabolic biomarkers for early diagnosis of PD. Multi-voxel 1H-MRS can provide information on brain neurochemistry and may be a promising technique for diagnosis of and monitoring neuronal loss in PD.", "doi": "10.1002/brb3.792", "title": "Detection and application of neurochemical profile by multiple regional 1H-MRS in Parkinson's disease.", "journal": ["Brain and behavior", "Brain Behav"]}
