Over recent years, increasing evidence has led to the suggestion that the mutations underlying certain forms of PD impair autophagy. Autophagy is a degradative pathway that delivers cytoplasmic content to lysosomes for degradation and represents a major route for degradation of aggregated cellular proteins and dysfunctional organelles. Autophagy up-regulation is a promising therapeutic strategy that is being explored for its potential to protect cells against the toxicity of aggregate-prone proteins in neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we describe how the mutations in different subtypes of PD can affect different stages of autophagy.", "doi": "10.1042/EBC20170023", "title": "Autophagy impairment in Parkinson's disease.", "journal": ["Essays in biochemistry", "Essays Biochem."]}
