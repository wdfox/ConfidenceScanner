However, findings with investigational NR2B receptor antagonists in PD patients have been mixed. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of the NR2B selective N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist MK-0657 on levodopa-induced dyskinesias and motor symptoms in PD patients.A randomized, double-blind, single-dose, 2-period crossover study was conducted in 22 patients with PD and levodopa-induced peak-dose dyskinesias. Patients received oral MK-0657 (7 mg) or placebo, in randomized order, on each of 2 test days. On both days, levodopa was administered as a 2-hour intravenous infusion at greater than or equal to 1 mg/kg per hour with frequent assessments of dyskinesia, motor function, and pharmacokinetics.MK-0657 7 mg had no significant effect on dyskinesias (difference versus placebo in modified Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale mean change from baseline area under the curve over 5 hours, -2.3; 95% confidence interval, -5.1 to 0.4) or motor function (difference versus placebo in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III mean change from baseline area under the curve over 5 hours, 13.9; 95% confidence interval, -1.7 to 29.5). MK-0657 7 mg achieved the target mean maximum plasma concentration of 400 nM.These data suggest that a single dose of MK-0657 7 mg is not effective in improving levodopa-induced dyskinesias and motor symptoms in PD patients.clinicaltrials.gov NCT00505843.", "doi": "10.1097/WNF.0000000000000241", "title": "A Phase Ib Randomized Controlled Study to Evaluate the Effectiveness of a Single-Dose of the NR2B Selective N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Antagonist MK-0657 on Levodopa-Induced Dyskinesias and Motor Symptoms in Patients With Parkinson Disease.", "journal": ["Clinical neuropharmacology", "Clin Neuropharmacol"]}
