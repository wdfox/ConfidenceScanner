Allele-specific polymerase chain reaction was used for screening of three pathogenic single nucleotide polymorphisms in alpha-synuclein gene. Moreover, 20% samples were randomly selected for bidirectional Sanger sequencing to confirm the results. SPSS 13 was used for data analysis.Of the 374 participants, 174(46.5%) were patients and 200(53.5%) were controls. The mean age for the onset of the disease was 55\u00b113 years. No polymorphism was observed for rs104893875(G>A), rs104893877(G>A) and rs104893878(C>G) in alpha-synuclein gene in samples of patients and controls.Alpha-synuclein gene mutations might not be relevant to all the populations in causing Parkinson's disease.", "doi": null, "title": "Absence of SNCA polymorphisms in Pakistani Parkinsons disease patients.", "journal": ["JPMA.
