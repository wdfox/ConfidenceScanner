Previously, we reported that CVT-301 improved OFF symptoms relative to placebo. In this study, we evaluate pulmonary function in patients treated with a single dose of CVT-301 or placebo for 3 hours, or received multiple doses/day for 4 weeks.As part of two phase 2 studies, pulmonary safety and tolerability of CVT-301 were evaluated in PD patients experiencing motor fluctuations (\u22652 hours OFF/day), Hoehn and Yahr stage 1-3, and forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity ratio \u226575% of predicted (in ON state). In study A, patients received single doses of oral carbidopa/LD and each of the following via the inhaled route: placebo and 25 and 50\u2009mg LD fine particle dose (FPD) CVT-301. In study B, patients received up to 3 inhaled doses/day of 35\u2009mg (weeks 1-2) and 50\u2009mg LD FPD CVT-301 (weeks 3-4) versus placebo. Assessments included spirometry and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs).In study A, (n\u2009=\u200924) mean age\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation was 61.3\u2009\u00b1\u20097.4 years, mean time since diagnosis was 10.5\u2009\u00b1\u20094.6 years, and mean duration of LD treatment 8.4\u2009\u00b1\u20093.7 years. Assessment of pulmonary function (predose to 3 hours postdose) showed that spirometry findings were within normal ranges, regardless of treatment groups, or motor status at screening. In study B, (n\u2009=\u200986) mean age was 62.4\u2009\u00b1\u20098.7 years, time since PD diagnosis was 9.4\u2009\u00b1\u20093.9 years, and duration of LD treatment 7.8\u2009\u00b1\u20093.9 years. Longitudinal assessment of pulmonary function over 4 weeks showed no significant difference in spirometry between CVT-301 versus placebo groups. In both studies, the most common CVT-301 TEAE was mild-to-moderate cough (study A: 21%; study B: 7% vs. 2% in placebo). Other common TEAEs in study B were dizziness and nausea.Acute and longitudinal assessment of pulmonary function showed that CVT-301 treatment was not associated with acute airflow obstruction in this population. CVT-301 was generally safe and well tolerated.", "doi": "10.1089/jamp.2016.1354", "title": "Pulmonary Safety and Tolerability of Inhaled Levodopa (CVT-301) Administered to Patients with Parkinson's Disease.", "journal": ["Journal of aerosol medicine and pulmonary drug delivery", "J Aerosol Med Pulm Drug Deliv"]}
